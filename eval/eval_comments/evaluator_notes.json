While it raises valid concerns about statistical robustness, computational cost, and reproducibility, most comments are high-level and could apply to many meta-learning or Mean Teacher variants. There is limited engagement with paper-specific design choices or concrete experimental behaviors. Therefore, it's more like AI-generated review comments."

Some comments are with well-supported arguments, but others (like baseline comparisons) could be more specific. The stance is neutral. It is hard to tell whether this review is AI or human based. I slightly lean towards human written due to some detailed check of the methodology (mathematical rigor), but agree that the level of specificity could also suggest AI."
