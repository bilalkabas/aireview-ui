    "abstract": "Breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM) affects women’s health globally, calling\n for the development of effective diagnosis and prognosis solutions. While deep\n learning has exhibited impressive capacities across various healthcare domains, its\n applicability in BCBM diseases is consistently hindered by the lack of an open,\n large-scale, deep learning-ready dataset. As such, we introduce the Bone Metastasis\n (BoneMet) dataset, the first large-scale, publicly available, high-resolution medical\n resource, which is derived from a well-accepted murine BCBM model. The unique\n advantage of BoneMet over existing human datasets is repeated sequential scans\n per subject over the entire disease development phases. The dataset consists of\n over 67 terabytes of multi-modal medical data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D\n CT scans, and detailed biological data (e.g., medical records and bone quantitative\n analysis), collected from more than five hundreds mice spanning from 2019 to\n 2024. Our BoneMet dataset is well-organized into six components, i.e., Rotation\nX-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec. We further\n show that BoneMet can be readily adopted to build versatile, large-scale AI models\n for managing BCBM diseases in terms of diagnosis using 2D or 3D images, prognosis of bone deterioration, and sparse-angle 3D reconstruction for safe long-term\n disease monitoring. Our preliminary results demonstrate that BoneMet has the\n potentials to jump-start the development and fine-tuning of AI-driven solutions\n prior to their applications to human patients. To facilitate its easy access and\n wide dissemination, we have created the BoneMet package, providing three APIs\n that enable researchers to (i) flexibly process and download the BoneMet data\n filtered by specific time frames; and (ii) develop and train large-scale AI models for\n precise BCBM diagnosis and prognosis. The BoneMet dataset is officially available on Hugging Face Datasets at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoneMet/BoneMet. The BoneMet package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/BoneMet. Code and tutorials are available at https://github.com/Tiankuo528/BoneMet.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel large-scale dataset (named BoneMet) of Breast tumor bone metastasis for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment management. It consists of six components: Rotational X-Ray Imagery, Reconstructed CT Imagery, Segmented CT Imagery, Registered CT Imagery, Region of Interest CT Imagery, and Mice Medical Records. Besides, the author conducted a series of experiments on the BoneMet dataset by developing various deep learning models to exhibit its applicability and efficiency in managing BTBM disease. The enormous open-source dataset has significant implications for the development of new algorithms in this field beyond doubt.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n(1) The motivation of this study is clear and the background is well presented in the manuscript.\nThe main contribution of this work is to release a large-scale breast tumor bone metastasis dataset BoneMet, for the research community. Upon the subsets of the BoneMet, the researchers are allowed to develop some novel approaches to solve the task of breast tumor bone metastasis diagnosis and prognosis, and thus facilitating the automated analysis for breast tumor bone metastasis.\n(2) Apart from the information of the collected dataset, the authors also developed several deep learning models to validate the applicability and efficacy of BoneMet.\n(3) Dataset, code and tutorials are made available for free use.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n(1) The technical contributions of this study are quite marginal, as most of the deep learning models are built upon existing methods.\n(2) Some details about the dataset preparation and experiments are missing.\n(3) Some settings and analyses in the experiment may not support the objectives.\n(4) The quality of the labels, particularly the pixel-wise annotation of the bone, might be questionable.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Authors describe that Seg-CT and Recon-CT are independent. What is the difference between 3D CT scans in Recon-CT and Seg-CT? What is the meaning of the adjective 'segmented'?\n2. Line 341 \"Second, we observe a significant training-test accuracy gap of 20.4% with ViT (w/o STA), indicating a pronounced overfitting issue inherent to the ViT architecture.\"\nI think ViT, as a visual backbone network, is less overfitting compared to other structures such as CNN. In addition, is the decrease in accuracy necessarily overfitting?\n3. Section 3.1, the purpose and analysis of experiments is confusing. Why comparing two ViT models could demonstrate the applicability of the Rotation-X-Ray dataset to manage BTBM disease? What is the relation between the effectiveness of\nSTA and the applicability of the Rotation-X-Ray dataset? All subsections 3.2-4 have similar questions.\n4. The experiment did not report data partitioning.\n5. Table 2 reported metrics on the training and testing data. Is there any evaluation/dev data?\n6. The experiment reported many indicator values, but their actual clinical significance has not been evaluated. For example, what are the Precision/Recall/F1-Score/Accuracy of clinical experts on the BTBM diagnosis? Besides, the 3D-GAN, T-VAE, and ST-VAE methods achieve SSIM values of 0.767, 0.817, and 0.860. So, what role can they play in clinical practice?\n7. The authors used many existing softwares as the processing tools to generate the sub-datasets of BoneMet. Please provide the corresponding reference and specify whether it is free of charge or not. Also, please accurately explain in which case the datasets are processed by the Seg-API, Regist-API and RoI-API that were developed by the authors.\n8. Are Pre-Op and Post-Op refer to pre-operation and post-operation? Please give the full spelling.\n9. For RoI-CT, the tibiae ROI is assigned with different pixel values. As shown in Figure 4, for each CT example, is the processed CT image contains the values of 180, 240, 60 and 0 only? If yes, the original CT turns to a segmentation mask instead, and lots of information would be lost.\n10. In the whole preparation procedure, it seems that the manual annotation of the organs or tumors is not involved, except for the manual cropping of fibular by  CTAn®. How could we ensure the effectiveness of the existing software?\n11. In Table 1, the column \"Spatial Resolution\" might be accurately filled out as most of them indicate the organs. Please revise it.\n12. Some details about the BoneMet dataset are missing. For instance, the number of mice is not introduced. Besides, in Table 1, the images/records are classified into two categories, i.e., positive and negative. Is the label assigned at the slice level or animal level? Besides, we noticed that the numbers of Seg-CT are larger than those of Recon-CT, which makes it confusing, as the Seg-CT is obtained from Recon-CT.\n13. I also have concerns about the MiceMediRec dataset. It mainly consists of the medical record and quantitative analysis results of 3D CT images, simulation and mechanical testing. The authors list only a part of the features in Table S2 in the supplementary file. However, all feature should be provided. The off-the-shelf software, such as CTAn®, was used to generate the quantitative parameters, which took about half an hour for each case of animal. In Section 3.3, the multi-modal prognostic assessment model first leveraged the GAN to produce the CT scan of the future point and use the quantitative data in the MiceMediRec dataset as the ground truth label to validate the predicted reaction force values. However, the details about how to obtain the predicted reaction force values are not clear.\n14. In my opinion, multi-modal learning might refer to a way to integrate the information of multi-source data to build a model. However, the application in Section 3.3 just used CT data as model input. Please consider revising it.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nThe authors have obtained ethical approval from their institution, and thus, so the ethics review is not needed.",

The resource encompasses six components, including rotational X-ray, reconstructed CT, segmented CT, registered CT, region of interest CT, and mice medical records. The authors further validate the dataset’s utility through experiments using several deep learning models. The paper’s motivation is clearly articulated, and its main strength lies in providing an openly available dataset that can facilitate further research in BTBM diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment management. Overall presentation is adequate, though some methodological and descriptive details are lacking.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Technical novelty**: The study’s technical contribution appears limited, as the applied deep learning models are primarily based on existing architectures without clear methodological innovation.  \n2. **Dataset details**: Important information about dataset preparation, labeling quality, and sample counts (e.g., number of mice, labeling granularity) is insufficient. Clarification is also needed on how different sub-datasets (e.g., Seg-CT and Recon-CT) are defined and generated.  \n3. **Experimental design**: The purpose and logic of the experiments are unclear. The relationship between specific model comparisons (e.g., ViT variants, STA component) and the dataset’s applicability to BTBM management requires explanation.  \n4. **Data management and evaluation**: The manuscript omits key details such as data partitioning schemes, use of validation sets, and the clinical interpretability of reported metrics.  \n5. **Annotation and labeling accuracy**: Concerns remain regarding the reliability of labels, particularly for pixel-level segmentation, given the apparent absence of manual annotation steps.  \n6. **Use of external software**: The manuscript should include references and licensing details for external tools used in dataset processing, and clarify when custom APIs were applied.  \n7. **MiceMediRec dataset**: The description of this sub-dataset is incomplete, lacking full feature lists and clear explanation of how predicted and ground-truth values were generated.  \n8. **Terminology and conceptual clarity**: Terms such as “multi-modal learning,” “Pre-/Post-Op,” and “segmented CT” should be precisely defined and consistently applied.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Correct inconsistent entries in Table 1, including spatial resolution fields.  \n- Specify whether RoI-CT values represent discrete masks or continuous CT intensity values.  \n- Provide complete spellings and clarify acronyms.  \n- Ensure figures and tables contain sufficient labeling and annotations for full interpretability.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis paper makes a valuable contribution by releasing a comprehensive dataset that may advance BTBM research. The provision of code and tutorials further supports reproducibility. However, the technical and methodological aspects of the experiments need clearer justification, and several dataset preparation and documentation details are incomplete. Improving the transparency of data generation, labeling, and evaluation would substantially strengthen the manuscript’s scientific soundness and usability.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** — The dataset release is significant, but the manuscript requires substantial clarification and methodological refinement before acceptance.",

        "text": "---\n\n## **Phase 1 – Analytical & Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript clearly falls within the methodological scope of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI)*.  \nAlthough it primarily introduces a dataset rather than a new algorithmic framework, it directly supports medical imaging methodology by enabling development and benchmarking of imaging reconstruction, segmentation, registration, and prognosis models. The inclusion of multiple imaging modalities (2D X-ray, 3D CT) and temporal alignment further strengthens its relevance for imaging physics, reconstruction, and AI-based image analysis.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \n⚠️ Moderate. The work’s central novelty is the assembly and dissemination of an exceptionally large, multi-modal, longitudinal murine imaging dataset specialized for breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM). While the technical foundation (image acquisition and FBP-based CT reconstruction) is standard, the dataset’s scale, longitudinal structure, systematic processing, and accompanying APIs for segmentation, registration, and RoI cropping provide methodological value. However, most methodological demonstrations (e.g., ViT diagnosis, generative prognosis, sparse-angle reconstruction) reuse established algorithms to illustrate utility rather than introduce fundamentally new imaging methodology.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nHigh in data collection, moderate in validation. The paper meticulously documents imaging parameters, animal model design, sample numbers, temporal alignment, data organization, and preprocessing pipelines—indicating strong engineering and reproducibility standards. The demonstration studies show feasibility (diagnosis, prognosis, sparse reconstruction) but are limited in depth of experimental comparison and statistical evaluation. Metrics are provided, but details on error analysis, uncertainty, or generalization to human data are minimal.\n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nGenerally clear and well-structured; grammar and formatting are acceptable though inconsistent spacing, capitalization, and symbol rendering (e.g., “0°0.8°1.6°...”) and minor typographical errors recur. Figures are informative but sometimes heavily compressed. Section organization and dataset tables are comprehensive.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nStrong compliance. IACUC approval is explicitly stated with details on anesthesia, radiation dose, and humane animal treatment. Data is publicly released (Hugging Face, PyPI, GitHub), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility. Ethical data handling appears compliant with TMI standards.\n\n---\n\n## **Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n### **1. Summary**\nThe authors present **BoneMet**, a large-scale, longitudinal, multi-modal murine dataset designed for research on breast cancer bone metastasis. The dataset contains over **67 TB** of high-resolution rotational X-rays and 3D CT scans from **500+ mice** over five years, complemented by biological and mechanical metadata. Data are organized into six components (Rotation-X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec). The accompanying **BoneMet Python package** provides APIs for CT segmentation, registration, and region-of-interest cropping. Demonstration studies validate dataset usability in (i) X-ray/CT-based disease diagnosis, (ii) prognosis via 3D generative modeling and biomechanical simulation, and (iii) sparse-angle CT reconstruction using NeRF variants.\n\n### **2. Strengths**\n- **Significant dataset contribution:** First open, large-scale, longitudinal murine imaging database addressing a major gap in preclinical BCBM research.  \n- **Comprehensive documentation:** Detailed acquisition, reconstruction, labeling, and ethical compliance, promoting reproducibility.  \n- **Multi-modality & temporal richness:** Enables diverse imaging tasks including segmentation, registration, longitudinal progression modeling, and reconstruction.  \n- **Practical infrastructure:** Public dataset hosting, APIs, and tutorials lower access barriers for the imaging community.  \n- **Clinical and translational potential:** Provides a valuable foundation for deep-learning approaches in BCBM diagnosis and mechanical property prediction.\n\n### **3. Weaknesses**\n- **Limited methodological novelty:** The imaging pipeline primarily employs established methods (FBP, simple segmentation/registration), and the deep-learning models are off-the-shelf architectures used for illustration.  \n- **Insufficient methodological benchmarking:** Experimental sections demonstrate feasibility but lack comparison with alternative datasets or statistical robustness (error bars, uncertainty analysis).  \n- **Scope–fit risk:** As a dataset paper, the contribution may align better with *TMI’s Dataset and Benchmark Notes* if intended primarily as a resource rather than a methodological advance.  \n- **Presentation polish:** Occasional formatting, typographic inconsistencies, and figure readability issues.  \n- **Limited generalization evidence:** No demonstration on human data or cross-modality adaptation, leaving translational claims speculative.\n\n### **4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify methodological innovation:** Articulate explicitly how BoneMet advances medical imaging *methodology* rather than serving solely as a data resource (e.g., novel CT alignment pipeline, automated longitudinal registration protocols, or quantitative validation routines).  \n2. **Benchmarking and comparative analysis:** Provide systematic evaluations across algorithms, not just proof-of-concept. For instance, compare STA-ViT, CNN, and other temporal models statistically over multiple folds; quantify uncertainty across subjects.  \n3. **Dataset citation and maintenance:** Include DOIs, version control plans, and data access statements consistent with IEEE reproducibility guidelines.  \n4. **Broaden generalization discussion:** While murine data are preclinical, briefly assess representativeness and potential transfer to human imaging scenarios.  \n5. **Condense or restructure the manuscript:** Some content is descriptive (e.g., operational minutiae) and could move to supplementary material to emphasize scientific insights within main text.\n\n### **5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct spacing and capitalization in headings (e.g., “A N OPEN LARGE -SCALE MULTI -MODAL…”).  \n- Figures 1–4: improve font sizes and legends for readability.  \n- Provide consistent units (µm vs. micron, Gy vs. mGy).  \n- Ensure reference formatting conforms to IEEE style (e.g., numbered citations with bracketed numbers).  \n- Minor grammar issues (use “data are” instead of “data is”, etc.).  \n- Verify that “MMST-ViT,” “ST-VAE,” and other abbreviations are defined upon first use.\n\n### **6. Overall Recommendation**\n**Recommendation:** 🔸 *Reject (Out of Scope / Low Novelty for TMI)* *or* consider resubmission as a **“TMI Dataset or Resource Note”** if such track exists.  \n*Rationale:* Scientifically valuable and methodologically rigorous dataset, but limited novelty in imaging methodology relative to regular TMI research articles. The contribution is infrastructural rather than algorithmic.\n\nIf reoriented toward method development (e.g., automated registration toolkit or sparse-angle reconstruction algorithm with novel design and analytical validation), the paper could qualify for Major Revision consideration.\n\n### **7. Confidence Level:** 5/5  \nAssessment based on strong familiarity with medical imaging datasets, quantitative imaging, and deep-learning-based reconstruction methods.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** *BoneMet* represents a high–impact community resource with careful technical execution and strong potential to catalyze methodological advances. However, in its current form it is more a **dataset introduction paper** than a **methodological innovation manuscript**, placing it marginally below the typical novelty threshold for IEEE *Transactions on Medical Imaging*.",

Systematic benchmarking with alternative methods and uncertainty analysis would strengthen the validation.  \n3. **Scope and Fit** – Given its dataset-oriented focus, the submission may align better with a dataset or resource note format rather than a full research article.  \n4. **Generalization and Translational Relevance** – The manuscript could briefly discuss how the murine data relate to human imaging contexts and whether such translation is feasible or currently limited.  \n5. **Manuscript Structure and Focus** – Some highly descriptive sections could be condensed or moved to supplementary material to better highlight methodological insights and analytical design.  \n6. **Data Access and Maintenance** – The dataset release should include DOIs, clear versioning, and reproducibility statements to ensure long-term accessibility and citation consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Correct spacing, capitalization, and typographical inconsistencies in headings and figure labels.  \n- Improve figure readability by enlarging fonts and refining legends.  \n- Standardize units (µm vs. micron, Gy vs. mGy).  \n- Ensure all abbreviations (e.g., MMST-ViT, ST-VAE) are defined at first mention.  \n- Apply consistent reference formatting and minor grammar corrections (“data are” instead of “data is”).\n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis work presents a well-documented, ethically approved, and publicly released imaging dataset that fills a substantial gap for preclinical bone metastasis research. Its strengths lie in the scale, multimodality, longitudinal design, and reproducible infrastructure. However, methodological novelty and analytical validation are limited, reducing its suitability as a full research article. The dataset’s clarity and accessibility suggest strong community value, but the lack of new algorithmic or analytical contributions constrains its scientific impact within methodological venues.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Recommendation: Reject (Resubmit as Dataset or Resource Note).**  \nWhile technically rigorous and valuable to the community, the contribution is primarily infrastructural rather than methodological. A reframing emphasizing novel analytical pipelines or validation frameworks could merit reconsideration under a different submission category.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces BoneMet, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM) diagnosis and prognosis derived from murine models. The dataset comprises 67 terabytes of data from over 500 mice collected between 2019-2024, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and medical records organized into six components: Rotation-X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec (Section 2.1, Table 1). The authors demonstrate the dataset's applicability through experiments on BCBM diagnosis using Vision Transformers and CNNs, achieving accuracies ranging from 79.1% to 92.0% (Section 3.2-3.3), prognostic assessment of bone mechanical properties using generative models (Section 3.4), and sparse-angle CT reconstruction (Section 3.5). The dataset is publicly available through Hugging Face with accompanying APIs for image processing tasks.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Limited experimental validation scope**: The evaluation demonstrates basic feasibility but lacks comprehensive benchmarking against established methods or clinical relevance assessment. The experiments primarily show that existing models can achieve reasonable performance on the dataset rather than demonstrating significant advances in BCBM diagnosis. Standard accuracy metrics (Table 3, Figures 5a-5d) do not establish clinical utility or compare against radiologist performance, limiting impact assessment.\n\n• **Inadequate mathematical and technical rigor**: No mathematical formulations are provided for key processing steps, making reproducibility challenging. The segmentation threshold selection (75/255, Section 2.1, Page 4) lacks theoretical justification or validation studies. Registration methodology mentions mutual information maximization (Section A, Page 15) without presenting the optimization objective function or convergence criteria, hindering technical assessment and reproducibility.\n\n• **Questionable generalizability to human clinical applications**: The murine model limitations are acknowledged but insufficiently addressed regarding translation potential. Significant physiological differences between mice and humans (disease progression timescales of weeks vs. years, Section G, Page 20) raise concerns about clinical relevance. The animal-level labeling approach (Section 3, Page 6) differs substantially from typical clinical diagnostic scenarios where lesion-level or time-specific predictions are needed.\n\n• **Insufficient dataset quality assessment**: Missing critical analyses of data quality, annotation consistency, and potential biases. The 20.4% training-test accuracy gap with ViT (Table 3) suggests possible overfitting issues or data quality problems that remain unexplored. Inter-annotator agreement, segmentation accuracy validation, and systematic quality control measures are not reported (Section 2.1), raising concerns about dataset reliability.\n\n• **Methodological limitations in experimental design**: The experimental setup lacks statistical rigor and proper controls. Cross-validation is mentioned (Section 3.1) but detailed statistical analysis, confidence intervals, or significance testing are absent from results (Tables 3-5). Comparison baselines are limited, and the choice of evaluation metrics may not reflect clinical decision-making requirements, reducing the validity of performance claims.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Expand experimental validation comprehensively**: Conduct thorough benchmarking against state-of-the-art BCBM diagnosis methods and include radiologist performance comparisons. Evaluate clinical relevance through collaboration with medical professionals and assess diagnostic accuracy at clinically meaningful thresholds. Implement more diverse evaluation metrics including sensitivity/specificity analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves to better demonstrate clinical utility.\n\n• **Enhance mathematical formalization and technical documentation**: Provide complete mathematical formulations for all image processing steps, including segmentation algorithms, registration optimization objectives, and reconstruction methods. Justify threshold selection through systematic validation studies and present convergence criteria for iterative procedures. Include detailed algorithmic descriptions and parameter sensitivity analyses to ensure reproducibility and technical soundness.\n\n• **Address generalizability concerns systematically**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of murine-to-human translation challenges and provide validation strategies for clinical applications. Develop time-scale normalization approaches to bridge the temporal gap between mouse and human disease progression. Implement lesion-level labeling and evaluation protocols that better match clinical diagnostic scenarios and demonstrate translational potential through pilot human studies or existing human dataset comparisons.\n\n• **Implement rigorous dataset quality assessment**: Establish comprehensive quality control protocols including inter-annotator agreement studies, systematic bias analysis, and data consistency validation. Address overfitting concerns through detailed data quality investigation and implement cross-dataset validation approaches. Develop standardized annotation guidelines and provide quantitative quality metrics for all dataset components to ensure reliability and scientific rigor.\n\n• **Strengthen experimental methodology and statistical analysis**: Implement proper statistical testing frameworks with confidence intervals, significance tests, and multiple comparison corrections. Expand baseline comparisons to include more diverse and recent methods, and develop clinically-relevant evaluation protocols. Provide detailed cross-validation results, learning curve analyses, and failure case studies to better characterize model performance and limitations across different scenarios.",

        "text": "## BONEMET: AN OPEN LARGE-SCALE MULTI-MODAL MURINE DATASET FOR BREAST CANCER BONE METASTASIS DIAGNOSIS AND PROGNOSIS\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper introduces BoneMet, a large-scale, open murine dataset for breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM), comprising 67 TB of high-resolution multi-modal data: rotational 2D X-rays, reconstructed 3D CTs, segmented/registered/ROI CT volumes, and detailed longitudinal biological and mechanical records across >500 mice scanned weekly over 3–5 weeks. The authors release accompanying APIs for segmentation, registration, and ROI selection and demonstrate dataset utility through preliminary benchmarks for BCBM diagnosis on 2D/3D modalities, prognosis via future CT generation with FE-based mechanical assessment, and sparse-angle CT reconstruction from a single X-ray using NeRF-style methods. The central value proposition is the unique, repeated longitudinal imaging across the disease course, which is often unavailable in human datasets, enabling both supervised and self-supervised research directions.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe dataset’s longitudinal design (weekly repeated scans over multiple weeks per mouse) is a unique and valuable feature rarely available at this scale, enabling temporal modeling and prognosis tasks.Inclusion of multiple, well-aligned modalities (2D projections, 3D reconstructions, segmented/registered tibiae, ROI overlays) plus structured biological/mechanical measurements supports diverse AI tasks (diagnosis, prognosis, sparse-view reconstruction).The provision of processing APIs for segmentation, registration, and ROI extraction is practical and lowers barriers to entry, encouraging reproducible workflows.\n- Experimental rigor and validationInitial benchmarks span complementary tasks: 2D spatiotemporal diagnosis (ViTs), 3D CT diagnosis (CNNs/ViTs), generative temporal prognosis with FE-derived mechanical evaluation, and sparse-angle reconstruction (PixelNeRF/MedNeRF).Mouse-level data splits reduce subject-level leakage risks; five-fold cross-validation on training sets is a sound practice.\n- Clarity of presentationThe six-component dataset structure is well-articulated, with high-level workflows and per-component descriptions that help prospective users understand the data flow from acquisition to derived products.Supplementary information outlines acquisition parameters and pipeline steps (reconstruction, segmentation, registration, ROI generation).\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a recognized bottleneck: lack of large, longitudinal, multimodal, high-resolution datasets for bone metastasis in breast cancer.Provides a substrate for label-efficient learning, longitudinal modeling, physics-based reconstruction, and mechanobiology-informed prediction—research directions of high current interest.Potential to seed foundation-model pretraining for orthopedics/oncology imaging and accelerate translation to human data.\n\n- The dataset’s longitudinal design (weekly repeated scans over multiple weeks per mouse) is a unique and valuable feature rarely available at this scale, enabling temporal modeling and prognosis tasks.\n- Inclusion of multiple, well-aligned modalities (2D projections, 3D reconstructions, segmented/registered tibiae, ROI overlays) plus structured biological/mechanical measurements supports diverse AI tasks (diagnosis, prognosis, sparse-view reconstruction).\n- The provision of processing APIs for segmentation, registration, and ROI extraction is practical and lowers barriers to entry, encouraging reproducible workflows.\n\n- Initial benchmarks span complementary tasks: 2D spatiotemporal diagnosis (ViTs), 3D CT diagnosis (CNNs/ViTs), generative temporal prognosis with FE-derived mechanical evaluation, and sparse-angle reconstruction (PixelNeRF/MedNeRF).\n- Mouse-level data splits reduce subject-level leakage risks; five-fold cross-validation on training sets is a sound practice.\n\n- The six-component dataset structure is well-articulated, with high-level workflows and per-component descriptions that help prospective users understand the data flow from acquisition to derived products.\n- Supplementary information outlines acquisition parameters and pipeline steps (reconstruction, segmentation, registration, ROI generation).\n\n- Addresses a recognized bottleneck: lack of large, longitudinal, multimodal, high-resolution datasets for bone metastasis in breast cancer.\n- Provides a substrate for label-efficient learning, longitudinal modeling, physics-based reconstruction, and mechanobiology-informed prediction—research directions of high current interest.\n- Potential to seed foundation-model pretraining for orthopedics/oncology imaging and accelerate translation to human data.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsLabel granularity: current labels are assigned at the animal level across weeks; positive means a lesion occurs sometime within weeks 0–5. This inexact labeling for early time points can confound diagnostic training and evaluation (e.g., week-0 images labeled positive despite no lesion), and limits early-detection claims.Image encoding and quantitative fidelity: CT data appear to be stored as PNGs; micro-CT is typically 16-bit and HU-calibrated. PNG (often 8-bit) risks dynamic range loss and weakens quantitative reproducibility and downstream mechanistic analysis. Clarification on bit depth and HU calibration preservation is needed.Sparse-angle “single-view” reconstruction from a single X-ray is an extremely ill-posed problem; while NeRF-style priors can hallucinate plausible anatomy, clinical safety requires stronger validation and uncertainty quantification. Evaluation protocols must carefully avoid training-test leakage of subject-specific priors.Segmentation uses a fixed global threshold (75/255) without reported accuracy metrics or quality control; registration accuracy metrics (e.g., TRE, overlap) are not reported.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesDataset accessibility is unclear: links show placeholders (XXX). For a dataset paper, immediate availability, licensing, and stable identifiers are essential for reproducibility.The diagnostic experiments report high training accuracy (≈99.5%) and sizable generalization gaps for some models, suggesting overfitting. There is no calibration analysis, ROC/PR curves, per-week performance, ablations on confounders, or external validation.Prognosis (FE simulation) results show a single reaction-force curve example and an R^2 statistic without sample size, confidence intervals, or details on material models/boundary conditions. Robustness and statistical significance are not established.Sparse-view reconstruction metrics are given, but evaluation protocols (e.g., whether test-time fine-tuning was allowed, angle dependence, subject-wise separation) are not specified in sufficient detail; no uncertainty maps or failure-case analyses are provided.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesMultiple typographical inconsistencies: image sizes (e.g., “4,032 x 2.688 x 1”), “Rol-CT” vs “RoI-CT,” mixed scan-duration claims (10 min vs 4 min), tool names (“Dataviewer” vs “Dataviewer®”), and an unreadable R^2 symbol in the main text.Table and text occasionally diverge on dataset sizes and counts; some units are unclear or likely typos.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsSparse-view reconstruction literature has progressed beyond MedNeRF/PixelNeRF (e.g., structure-aware NeRFs, Gaussian representations for CT); these should be cited and discussed relative to the reported results.Recent murine micro-CT segmentation works and cross-domain generalization studies could contextualize the segmentation/registration pipelines and model choices.Label-efficient and weakly supervised learning in medical imaging is directly relevant given the animal-level labels; broader survey connections could strengthen methodological framing.\n\n- Label granularity: current labels are assigned at the animal level across weeks; positive means a lesion occurs sometime within weeks 0–5.

However, quantitative imaging data integrity needs clarification: if CT files are stored as PNGs with 8-bit depth, this undermines HU calibration, dynamic range, and quantitative reproducibility. Strongly recommend releasing 16-bit DICOM/TIFF/NRRD with preserved scanner geometry and calibration. Provide per-scan metadata (geometry, voxel size, kVp/mA, filters) in standardized form.Labeling: Animal-level labels are a practical start but limit early-detection claims. Consider curating timepoint-level labels (e.g., overt lesion presence, radiographic severity scores) and time-to-event labels for survival/hazard modeling. Even weak temporal labels (e.g., lesion appearance week) would enable more faithful evaluation of early detection and prognosis.Preprocessing and QC: Segmentation via a fixed threshold is brittle across ages/protocol variations; report segmentation/registration QC metrics (Dice/TRE against expert masks for a subset). Provide inter-rater variability where applicable and error rates for registration to baseline.APIs: Packaging is helpful; please include explicit versioning, dependency pinning, and unit tests. Consider adding checks for image bit depth/HU calibration and automated sanity checks (e.g., histogram stats per scan, geometry validation).\n- Experimental evaluation assessment2D/3D diagnosis: Report ROC-AUC/PR-AUC, calibration (ECE/Brier), and confidence intervals via bootstrapping. Provide per-week performance stratification to assess early vs late timepoints. Analyze overfitting gap (e.g., stronger regularization, augmentation, or longitudinal MIL baselines). Include simple radiomics baselines and logistic regression to establish lower bounds.Prognosis and FE validation: Expand beyond a single illustrative example. Specify n, report distributional statistics (MAE, RMSE, R^2 with CIs) across mice/timepoints. Detail FE pipeline (meshing, material models—homogeneous vs inhomogeneous density–elasticity mapping, boundary conditions, validation against 3-point bending tests where available). Evaluate clinical relevance by correlating predicted mechanical metrics with fracture outcomes or ex vivo mechanical tests for a subset.Sparse-angle reconstruction: Clearly describe training/testing protocols, whether per-instance fine-tuning was used (MedNeRF typically does), and enforce mouse-level disjoint splits. Provide angle ablations (which single view?), uncertainty quantification, and failure-case analyses. Consider modern baselines (e.g., SAX-NeRF, 3D Gaussian CT frameworks) and model-based methods (e.g., DOLCE/iterative hybrids) for a fairer landscape.Reproducibility: Publish standardized splits (mice IDs), seeds, and scripts. Consider offering a smaller curated benchmark subset (e.g., 100 mice) to facilitate quick experimentation and fair comparison.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Temporal prognosis aligns with T-VAE work on murine tibiae; your ST-VAE results improve SSIM/PSNR but need broader statistical backing and uncertainty quantification. Highlight differences in dataset scale, ROI definition, and integration with FE analyses relative to prior T‑VAE.Sparse-view reconstruction: Beyond PixelNeRF/MedNeRF, recent advances (e.g., structure-aware NeRFs and 3D Gaussian representations for CT) show significant gains and faster convergence; discussing them would better position your baselines and suggest future directions (e.g., FBP-guided priors, line-segment attention along rays).Label-efficient learning surveys emphasize the utility of weak/inexact labels; explicitly framing the animal-level labeling as inexact labels and proposing label refinement or MIL approaches would connect your dataset to current methodology.Murine CT segmentation and cross-institution generalization studies (e.g., Swin UNETR variants) support your registration/segmentation use case; incorporating those findings could inform robust baselines and cross-domain validation.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe dataset’s longitudinal nature and multimodality can catalyze early-detection research, mechanobiology-informed modeling, and safe imaging protocols through sparse-view methods. However, claims about pretraining for human translation should be tempered with domain-shift considerations (morphology, acquisition physics, dose, noise) and aligned with proposed benchmarks for cross-species transfer learning.Ethical and governance aspects: include IACUC protocol references, data usage license, and an ethical use statement. Given the dataset’s size, provide access modalities (e.g., streaming via Hugging Face datasets, chunked Zarr/N5 storage) and clear data cards with bias/limitations sections.Safety: emphasize that single-view reconstructions are not for clinical decision-making without strong uncertainty calibration and external validation; include guidance in the dataset documentation.\n\n- Dataset design: The longitudinal, multi-modal structure is a major strength. However, quantitative imaging data integrity needs clarification: if CT files are stored as PNGs with 8-bit depth, this undermines HU calibration, dynamic range, and quantitative reproducibility. Strongly recommend releasing 16-bit DICOM/TIFF/NRRD with preserved scanner geometry and calibration.

Include simple radiomics baselines and logistic regression to establish lower bounds.\n- Prognosis and FE validation: Expand beyond a single illustrative example. Specify n, report distributional statistics (MAE, RMSE, R^2 with CIs) across mice/timepoints. Detail FE pipeline (meshing, material models—homogeneous vs inhomogeneous density–elasticity mapping, boundary conditions, validation against 3-point bending tests where available). Evaluate clinical relevance by correlating predicted mechanical metrics with fracture outcomes or ex vivo mechanical tests for a subset.\n- Sparse-angle reconstruction: Clearly describe training/testing protocols, whether per-instance fine-tuning was used (MedNeRF typically does), and enforce mouse-level disjoint splits. Provide angle ablations (which single view?), uncertainty quantification, and failure-case analyses. Consider modern baselines (e.g., SAX-NeRF, 3D Gaussian CT frameworks) and model-based methods (e.g., DOLCE/iterative hybrids) for a fairer landscape.\n- Reproducibility: Publish standardized splits (mice IDs), seeds, and scripts. Consider offering a smaller curated benchmark subset (e.g., 100 mice) to facilitate quick experimentation and fair comparison.\n\n- Temporal prognosis aligns with T-VAE work on murine tibiae; your ST-VAE results improve SSIM/PSNR but need broader statistical backing and uncertainty quantification. Highlight differences in dataset scale, ROI definition, and integration with FE analyses relative to prior T‑VAE.\n- Sparse-view reconstruction: Beyond PixelNeRF/MedNeRF, recent advances (e.g., structure-aware NeRFs and 3D Gaussian representations for CT) show significant gains and faster convergence; discussing them would better position your baselines and suggest future directions (e.g., FBP-guided priors, line-segment attention along rays).\n- Label-efficient learning surveys emphasize the utility of weak/inexact labels; explicitly framing the animal-level labeling as inexact labels and proposing label refinement or MIL approaches would connect your dataset to current methodology.\n- Murine CT segmentation and cross-institution generalization studies (e.g., Swin UNETR variants) support your registration/segmentation use case; incorporating those findings could inform robust baselines and cross-domain validation.\n\n- The dataset’s longitudinal nature and multimodality can catalyze early-detection research, mechanobiology-informed modeling, and safe imaging protocols through sparse-view methods. However, claims about pretraining for human translation should be tempered with domain-shift considerations (morphology, acquisition physics, dose, noise) and aligned with proposed benchmarks for cross-species transfer learning.\n- Ethical and governance aspects: include IACUC protocol references, data usage license, and an ethical use statement. Given the dataset’s size, provide access modalities (e.g., streaming via Hugging Face datasets, chunked Zarr/N5 storage) and clear data cards with bias/limitations sections.\n- Safety: emphasize that single-view reconstructions are not for clinical decision-making without strong uncertainty calibration and external validation; include guidance in the dataset documentation.\n\n### Questions for Authors\n\n- Data availability: Are the dataset and code actually accessible now? The links contain “XXX”. Please provide working DOIs/URLs, licensing terms, and a data card detailing governance and permissible use.\n- Bit depth and calibration: In what format/bit depth are CT volumes released? Are HU values and scanner geometry preserved? If PNGs are 8-bit, can you release 16-bit DICOM/NRRD to maintain quantitative fidelity?\n- Labeling granularity: How are labels assigned across weeks for positive animals? Are early (pre-lesion) timepoints labeled positive? Do you plan to release timepoint-level lesion labels or time-to-event annotations?\n- Segmentation/registration QC: Do you have quantitative validation against expert annotations (Dice, HD95, TRE) for segmentation and registration? What proportion of scans required manual correction?\n- Confounders and splits: How are age, sex, strain, and interventions distributed between train/test? Did you stratify or control for these variables to avoid confounding?\n- Diagnosis metrics: Can you report ROC-AUC/PR-AUC, calibration (ECE), and per-week performance for the 2D/3D diagnosis tasks, with confidence intervals?\n- Prognosis scale: What is the number of mice/timepoints used to compute the ST-VAE and FE simulation metrics? Please report summary statistics (e.g., mean±SD) across the cohort and details of material models/boundary conditions.\n- Sparse-view protocol: For MedNeRF/PixelNeRF, was test-time fine-tuning used? Which single angle was provided? Can you provide angle-dependent performance and uncertainty maps?\n- Human translation: Do you have pilot results on human datasets (X-ray/CT) to illustrate transferability? If not, what is your plan for cross-species domain adaptation?\n- Dataset subsets: Given 67 TB size, will you provide curated, standardized benchmark subsets and streaming/chunked access to enable broader adoption?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nBoneMet is a timely, ambitious, and potentially field-shaping resource: longitudinal, high-resolution, multimodal murine data for BCBM is genuinely scarce, and the authors’ organization into six interoperable components plus APIs is thoughtfully designed. The preliminary experiments convincingly suggest broad applicability, especially the advantage of spatiotemporal alignment for 2D diagnosis and the feasibility of temporal CT prediction with mechanobiology readouts. However, to meet top-tier standards for a dataset paper, several elements require strengthening: immediate and verifiable availability with stable links and licenses; preservation of quantitative CT fidelity (bit depth/HU); clearer, finer-grained labels and evaluation protocols aligned with early-detection and prognosis claims; stronger experimental rigor (statistical reporting, calibration, confounder control, external validation); and enriched baselines that reflect the state of the art in sparse-view CT and label-efficient learning. Addressing these points—with added QC metrics for segmentation/registration, robust FE validation across cohorts, and comprehensive documentation—would substantially increase the dataset’s impact and its suitability for publication at a top venue.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents **BoneMet**, a large-scale open murine dataset designed for breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM) diagnosis and prognosis. It compiles 67 TB of multimodal, high-resolution data, including rotational 2D X-rays, reconstructed and segmented 3D CTs, and associated biological and mechanical records from over 500 mice monitored longitudinally. The dataset is intended to support diverse machine learning tasks, from diagnosis to prognosis and sparse-view reconstruction, and includes accompanying APIs to standardize segmentation, registration, and ROI selection. The paper is clearly written, with systematic documentation of the dataset’s structure and benchmark demonstrations, although some methodological and data integrity issues limit its immediate reproducibility.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Labeling Granularity** – Labels are defined at the animal level, marking an entire sequence positive if any lesion appears within weeks 0–5, potentially confounding early detection analyses. Incorporating week-level or time-to-event labels would improve clinical interpretability.  \n2. **Quantitative Fidelity** – CT data stored as 8-bit PNGs risk loss of dynamic range and HU calibration. Release of 16-bit calibrated DICOM/NRRD formats with full metadata would preserve quantitative validity.  \n3. **Evaluation and Overfitting** – Diagnostic models show near-perfect training accuracy with notable generalization gaps, indicating overfitting. Additional analyses (ROC/PR curves, calibration metrics, temporal stratification, and external validation) are needed.  \n4. **Sparse-View Reconstruction** – The “single-view” NeRF-based reconstruction is highly ill-posed; stronger uncertainty quantification, clearer separation of train/test subjects, and reference to recent structure-aware NeRF approaches are advised.  \n5. **Experimental Protocols** – The prognosis section lacks statistical rigor: very limited examples, no sample sizes or confidence intervals. Segmentation and registration steps lack reported accuracy metrics.  \n6. **Dataset Accessibility** – The dataset links are placeholders (“XXX”). Verified DOIs, licensing, and governance details are essential for reproducibility.  \n7. **Related Work and Context** – The paper omits discussion of newer sparse-view reconstruction and murine CT segmentation methods; citing these would better position the dataset’s scope.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Several typographical inconsistencies in scan duration, image dimensions, and variable notation.  \n- Missing or inconsistent dataset counts between tables and text.  \n- Recommend including ethical approvals, data license information, and access modalities (e.g., streaming, benchmark subsets).  \n- APIs should include versioning, dependency management, and automated QC checks for bit depth and geometry.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nBoneMet represents a valuable and timely resource filling a clear data gap in longitudinal, multimodal bone metastasis imaging. The paper’s presentation is generally strong, and the dataset’s potential for AI-driven prognosis and mechanobiological modeling is evident.

Opening paragraph summarizing the studied problem, proposed solution, and demonstrated results\n\nThe paper addresses a critical gap in breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM) research: the scarcity of large-scale, high-resolution, longitudinal datasets needed to develop and validate AI models for early detection and prognosis. The authors introduce BoneMet, the first comprehensive multi-modal murine dataset specifically designed for BCBM research, comprising over 67 terabytes of data from more than 500 mice spanning five years (2019-2024). The dataset is systematically organized into six components: Rotation-X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec, capturing 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and detailed biological records at multiple time points. The authors demonstrate BoneMet's utility across several applications: BCBM diagnosis using 2D and 3D images (achieving up to 92% accuracy with Swin-B architecture), prognosis of bone deterioration via multi-modal analysis, sparse-angle 3D reconstruction from single X-ray images, and tibiae auto-segmentation. They also provide the BoneMet package with APIs for data processing to enhance reproducibility. The experimental results validate that BoneMet can effectively support the development of AI models for BCBM management, with potential applications in early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and reduced radiation exposure during imaging.\n\n## 2. Major and minor comments on strengths and limitations\n\n### Major strengths:\n- **Groundbreaking dataset**: BoneMet represents the first large-scale, longitudinal, high-resolution medical dataset specifically designed for BCBM research, addressing a critical bottleneck in the field. Its multi-modal nature and temporal alignment across multiple disease stages offer unprecedented value.\n- **Comprehensive organization**: The six-component structure (Rotation-X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, MiceMediRec) provides a logical framework that supports diverse research applications from basic image analysis to complex multi-modal prognostic assessment.\n- **Strong experimental validation**: The authors demonstrate the dataset's utility across multiple applications with rigorous experiments, showing state-of-the-art results for BCBM diagnosis (92% accuracy) and promising outcomes for sparse-angle reconstruction and mechanical property prediction.\n- **Reproducibility focus**: The BoneMet package with well-documented APIs for segmentation, registration, and ROI cropping significantly lowers barriers for adoption and enhances reproducibility across the research community.\n\n### Major limitations:\n- **Translation to clinical practice**: While the murine model provides valuable data, the paper insufficiently addresses the specific physiological differences between mice and humans that may limit direct clinical translation. The authors should provide more concrete pathways for how findings from this dataset would translate to human applications.\n- **Accessibility challenges**: The enormous dataset size (67 TB) presents significant barriers for researchers without substantial computational resources. The paper needs to better address how researchers with limited infrastructure can access and utilize portions of the dataset.\n- **Model architecture details**: The experimental section lacks sufficient technical depth regarding the specific model architectures and their adaptations to the BoneMet dataset, which would strengthen the technical contribution.\n\n### Minor strengths:\n- **Clear visualization**: The figures effectively illustrate the data collection pipeline, processing workflow, and application examples, enhancing readability.\n- **Practical code examples**: Providing configuration code snippets for the APIs adds immediate practical utility for researchers.\n- **Ethical considerations**: The thorough ethical statement regarding animal welfare demonstrates responsible research practices.\n\n### Minor limitations:\n- **Lack of comparative analysis**: The paper would benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing smaller datasets to better highlight BoneMet's unique contributions.\n- **Incomplete data quality discussion: While the supplementary material mentions handling label noise and data imbalance, these critical challenges deserve more attention in the main text.\n- **Inconsistent figure referencing**: Some figures in the text lack corresponding captions in the layout, which could confuse readers.\n\n## 3. Summary paragraph evaluating the work along the 4 TMI editorial criteria\n\n**Significance**: The work addresses a significant and timely gap in BCBM research by providing the first large-scale, high-resolution, longitudinal dataset specifically designed for this application. The scarcity of quality datasets has been a major bottleneck in developing effective AI tools for BCBM, and this resource has substantial potential to catalyze progress in the field. The longitudinal nature of the data is particularly valuable for studying disease progression and treatment response.\n\n**Innovation**: The primary innovation lies in the systematic creation and organization of the BoneMet dataset itself, with its unique six-component structure designed to facilitate diverse research applications. The development of specialized APIs for data processing represents a valuable methodological contribution that enhances usability. While the paper focuses on resource creation rather than novel algorithms, this type of foundational work is essential for advancing medical imaging research.\n\n**Evaluation**: The evaluation is comprehensive across multiple applications with appropriate metrics for each task. The authors demonstrate the dataset's utility with multiple deep learning architectures and provide comparative results. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by more detailed ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on similar tasks, particularly regarding the performance of the sparse-angle reconstruction methods.\n\n**Reproducibility**: The work excels in reproducibility with the release of the BoneMet package containing well-documented APIs, code examples, and the complete dataset. The inclusion of detailed processing pipelines, configuration examples, and data organization specifications makes it straightforward for other researchers to adopt and build upon the work. The availability on Hugging Face and PyPI further enhances accessibility.\n\n## 4. Decision recommendation\n\n**Major revision (reject/resubmit)**\n\nWhile BoneMet represents a valuable resource that addresses a critical gap in BCBM research, several substantive issues need to be addressed before acceptance. The authors should provide more concrete discussion of the translation pathway from murine models to human clinical applications, including specific physiological differences and how they might impact model development. They must also address the practical challenges of the dataset's enormous size by providing clearer guidance on how researchers with limited computational resources can access and utilize the data. The experimental section requires additional technical depth regarding model architectures and comparative analyses with state-of-the-art methods. Strengthening the comparison with existing datasets and incorporating more discussion of data quality issues in the main text would also significantly enhance the paper's impact. Addressing these points would make this valuable resource even more impactful for the TMI community.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript introduces **BoneMet**, a large‑scale, longitudinal murine imaging repository intended to address the paucity of high‑resolution data for breast‑cancer bone metastasis (BCBM). Over the period 2019‑2024, more than five hundred mice were scanned, generating in excess of 67 TB of multi‑modal data. The collection is organized into six components: (i) rotational 2‑D X‑ray images, (ii) reconstructed 3‑D CT volumes, (iii) segmented tibia CTs, (iv) CTs registered to baseline scans, (v) region‑of‑interest CTs that isolate metastatic lesions, and (vi) comprehensive medical records containing quantitative bone measurements. A Python package accompanies the dataset, offering APIs for CT segmentation, registration, and ROI extraction to streamline preprocessing. The authors evaluate a set of off‑the‑shelf models on three tasks—diagnosis from 2‑D X‑ray, classification from 3‑D CT, and future‑frame prediction and sparse‑angle reconstruction. Reported results include up to 89 % accuracy for a spatial‑temporal vision transformer on X‑ray, 92 % accuracy for a Swin‑Transformer on registered CT, structural similarity indices of 0.86 for generative prediction, and PSNR/SSIM values of 30.2/0.81 for MedNeRF‑based reconstruction. The primary contribution is the public release of the dataset together with a processing toolkit to facilitate AI research on BCBM.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:**  By providing longitudinal, high‑resolution pre‑clinical imaging, BoneMet fills a noticeable gap in BCBM research and has the potential to accelerate development of temporal modelling approaches.  \n- **Innovation:**  The novelty lies chiefly in the scale, multimodality, and temporal depth of the dataset, as well as the provision of a ready‑to‑use API. No new algorithmic methodology is introduced.  \n- **Evaluation:**  Baseline experiments span diagnosis, prognosis, and reconstruction and demonstrate respectable performance (e.g., 89 % with STA‑ViT on rotational X‑ray, 92 % with Swin‑B on registered CT). Nevertheless, the evaluation is limited to a handful of pre‑existing models, lacks strong competitive baselines, and does not incorporate statistical testing or cross‑species validation.  \n- **Reproducibility:**  Although the authors intend to release the data on Hugging Face and the code on PyPI, the manuscript only contains placeholder URLs, omits licensing information, and provides insufficient detail on preprocessing, loss functions, and training schedules.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n1. **Label granularity:**  Positive and negative labels are defined at the animal level (“a metastatic bone lesion occurs between week 0 and week 5”) without per‑scan or per‑lesion annotation, which restricts the possibility of fine‑grained supervision (see Section 3.1).  \n2. **Absence of lesion‑level ground truth:**  No segmentation masks or bounding‑box annotations for individual lesions are provided; only whole‑animal labels are used. This precludes assessment of detection or localisation performance (Section 3).  \n3. **Baseline selection:**  The comparison omits several state‑of‑the‑art 3‑D architectures (e.g., 3‑D ResNet, MedicalNet) and conventional CT reconstruction techniques, making it difficult to gauge whether the reported accuracies are competitive (Figures 5, Table 5).  \n4. **Statistical reporting:**  Accuracy figures are presented without confidence intervals or hypothesis testing, and the claimed training‑test gap for the ViT with and without STA is not quantified (Table 3).  \n5. **External validation:**  No experiments evaluate the transferability of models trained on BoneMet to human BCBM imaging, which would be necessary to substantiate the translational claims made in the Introduction and Section 6.  \n6. **Ethical documentation:**  The manuscript does not include a statement of IACUC approval nor reference to ARRIVE guidelines for the animal work (Supplementary Section A).  \n7. **Dataset access:**  URLs are placeholders (“https://huggingface.co/datasets/”, “XXX”), and no DOI, version identifier, or guidance on data storage is provided, limiting verification of availability (Abstract, Section 4).  \n8. **Licensing:**  The terms of use are unspecified, leaving uncertainty about permissible commercial or derivative applications (Section 4).  \n9. **Ablation analysis:**  The contribution of temporal information, individual imaging modalities, or specific data augmentations to the reported performance is not examined (Section 3).  \n10. **Pre‑processing details:**  The description of 3‑D CT preprocessing and augmentation is sparse (e.g., only “RandAug (9, 0.5)” mentioned in Table 2), which hampers exact replication of the experiments.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\nThe manuscript presents a valuable dataset but, in its current form, does not satisfy the standards required for publication. Critical issues include insufficient annotation granularity, limited baseline comparisons, missing statistical analysis, lack of external validation, and incomplete documentation of data access and ethical compliance. Addressing these concerns would be necessary before the work could be considered for acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection using deep learning has garnered significant research attention due to its broad applicability, particularly in medical imaging where labeled anomalous data are scarce. While earlier approaches leverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent methods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance discrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse distillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to derive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring out-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to softly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account for the scale variation issue. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe authors propose a new method for anomaly detection in medical data setting using contrastive reverse distillation. The method uses knowledge distillation as it's foundation, implementing pre-trained teachers models along with a student model trained to either minimize or maximize its distance from the teachers in a feature-map space. They additionally utilize a scale adaptive mechanism to allow for better generalizations across different sizes of anomaly.\n\nTheir method's specific construction utilizes two teacher models with the same weights, one \"bad\" and one \"good\". The good model is given benign images while the bad model is given images with synthetic anomalies. The student model is then trained to maximize its cosine similarity with the per-layer features of the good teacher while minimizing the cosine similarity with the bad teacher. At evaluation time anomaly scores are computed by comparing the scaled, per-layer feature spaces of the good teacher against those of the student. Inputs with high levels of dissimilarity between the good model and student are given high anomaly scores.\n\nTheir evaluation against prior work is very comprehensive, comparing against a total of 18 other detectors. They out perform all other detectors on all three datasets (lung, brain, and skin anomalies) in terms of their main metrics (AUC, F1, and Accuracy).

Figures are also informative and easy to understand.\n* The idea of contrastive reverse distillation seems novel (to the best of my knowledge) and intuitive. I'd like to see how future works can iterate upon this framework in other settings or with improved constructions.\n* Motivation is well established for the usage synthetic anomalies, and the choice of simplex noise is clever.\n* Empirical analysis is very comprehensive in terms of datasets, baselines, and ablations.\n* The proposed method out-performs all baselines in terms of AUC, F1, and Accuracy.\n* The proposed method scales well with model architecture size, which is a good sign that the method is sensible.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nIn general, within my somewhat limited knowledge of this sub-field, I like this paper. In spite of that I think there are a few things the authors may want to consider to further strengthen their work.\n\nI think when discussing detection and AUC scores it is important to give them context within the given domain. See section B of [1] for some example discussion on this topic from a different field. I'd like the authors to consider the following questions:\n\n* Is it more important to maximize the true positive rate in spite of inducing some false positives? \n* Is it better to minimize false positives to increase confidence in the case of a positive prediction?\n* How do you anticipate doctors using these tools in their analysis?\n\nGiven this, it would also be nice if the authors could plot some of the ROCs between their method and some of the baselines (maybe including all of them is too visually messy, but at least the top 5). This way people can compare their method to the baselines at different levels of false positive rate.\n\nI think it would be good if the authors could include some extended discussion, either in the main body or the supplementary material, analyzing the more subtle features of their results. See the next section of my review \"Questions\" for some examples of what I think they can further analyze.\n\nLastly, the results of table 1 are good, but a bit overwhelming. I think it would help if the second best score in each metric is underlined and if the methods are visually grouped based on detector type (e.g. RD4AD, RD++, and ReContrast could be grouped together). Optionally it would be nice if all experiments were averaged over a few runs and given standard deviations or $\\pm$ scores, at least in the supplementary material. I understand if these experiments are too extensive to replicate too many times, though.\n\n [1] \"Membership Inference Attacks From First Principles\" https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03570\n\n### Questions\n\nHere I include some questions for the authors to consider.\n\n* Why does ISIC seem like the hardest dataset for all the detectors? Why is Brain Tumor the easiest?\n* Why is SAM more impactful in the Brain Tumor dataset while it seems minimally impactful in the RSNA dataset in table 2? Is this related at all to the results of table 3 - where Gaussian noise performs similar to simplex noise on RSNA, but much worse on Brain Tumor?\n* Can the method achieve better generalization by using a mixture of synthetic noise types, perhaps 10% gaussian, 90% simplex? \n* Can we improve performance by including some real world data in the training set, or will that harm generalization?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 3",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces a novel method for anomaly detection in medical imaging using *contrastive reverse distillation* (CRD). Building upon knowledge distillation, the approach employs two teacher models—one trained on benign images (“good”) and one on synthetic anomalies (“bad”)—and a student model trained to align with the good teacher and diverge from the bad teacher in feature-space similarity. A scale-adaptive mechanism is incorporated to improve generalization across anomaly sizes. The study offers an extensive evaluation over three datasets (lung, brain, skin) and demonstrates state-of-the-art results against 18 existing detectors. The paper is clearly written, well-motivated, and supported by comprehensive experiments and ablations.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Contextualization of Results**: While quantitative performance is strong, the discussion lacks context on the clinical implications of high AUC and detection rates. The authors could elaborate on trade-offs between maximizing true-positive rates versus minimizing false positives, particularly given the practical constraints of medical use.  \n2. **ROC Visualization**: Including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots comparing the proposed method with key baselines (e.g., top five) would help interpret performance across different false positive thresholds.  \n3. **Result Interpretation**: The results, particularly in Table 1, could benefit from additional analysis on dataset-specific behavior. For instance, ISIC appears hardest for all detectors, whereas Brain Tumor is easiest. The authors might discuss why this pattern occurs and how dataset characteristics influence performance.  \n4. **Presentation of Results**: Table 1 is dense and potentially overwhelming. Highlighting second-best results and visually grouping methods by detector type could improve readability. Reporting variability across runs (e.g., standard deviations) would further strengthen confidence in the reported results, though it is acknowledged this may be computationally intensive.  \n5. **Further Analysis**: The influence of the Scale Adaptive Mechanism (SAM) varies across datasets. The authors could clarify why SAM yields stronger effects on Brain Tumor data than on RSNA and consider whether different synthetic noise types or mixtures could enhance generalization.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Figures are clear and informative, and overall presentation quality is high.  \n- Terminology such as “contrastive reverse distillation” and “scale adaptive mechanism” are well introduced; minor labeling refinements in tables could improve clarity.  \n- Typographical quality and readability are good.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper is well-executed, clearly presented, and methodologically sound. The proposed use of CRD and synthetic anomalies is both intuitive and original, and the empirical evaluation is extensive.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nTwo issues arise in reverse knowledge distillation for medical imaging, an inability to properly distinguish between different features and an inability to deal with different scales. This work proposes two methods to address these issues: a contrastive student-teacher learning approach that involves using both a “good” and a “bad” teacher, as well as a scale adaptation mechanism. Results demonstrate that on almost every dataset the proposed approach is able to outperform existing techniques.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper is well written and the ideas are easy to follow. I appreciate how the authors identify the two problems facing medical imaging in this domain and then propose solutions. The new approach outperforms all other methods that the authors compare with in table 1.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nIssue 1: This paper doesn’t have any formal proofs or theorems to guarantee its effectiveness, therefore the strengths of the paper must rely on the experiments and empirical results. For the datasets I will admit as a review I am not very familiar with them. For example, on the image dataset CIFAR-10, a few years ago a jump from 93% to 98% was considered significant. Today an increase from 99% to 99.9% on CIFAR-10 would not even be considered a major contribution. Likewise, for these datasets it is hard to determine whether a jump of 3.01% and 4.38% (as the authors show) is worthy of publication. Could the authors please clarify how much other papers pushed the accuracy forward in other works, as compared to the increase their method is offering?\n\nIssue 2: The authors say they will release their code upon publication, but I did not see any code given in the supplemental material. This might be an oversight on my part, but where is the code? I would like to see a good faith gesture of releasing an anonymous github for the code or at least a zip file of the code. Too many papers claim SOTA results and never release code. In this day and age it is simply unacceptable to continue this trend. \n\nIssue 3: The authors also don’t mention anything about the runtime of their algorithm. How does the student-teacher setup and training time compare to other existing methods in the field? While this is not a HUGE concern, I think it would be good to have some discussion and analysis of this. For example could you show the training time complexity of your algorithm and the next two best methods in the field? Or even an experimental runtime of the training in seconds of your algorithm and the next two best methods? Without this I feel we don’t have the complete story when comparing methods. \n\nIssue 4: Please see my minor comments about uncited claims in the papers. For acceptance I would like to see citations for all the claims you have made. \n\nIssue 5: I don’t like the terminology “good” and “bad” teacher. It is very non-technical and hard to follow. Can you please change the terminology in your paper and name the teachers more appropriately? \n\nMinor Comments:\n\n=Line 36, “anomalous samples is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming…” I believe this is correct but I want to see a citation to backup this claim?\n\n=Line 45, “they tend to generalize too well, thereby risking the reconstruction of abnormal regions.” Citation for this claim? \n\n=Table 1 has many entries that are unsorted (aside from the bolded number indicating the best method). It would be better if this table was sorted in order of increasing AUC for the methods.\n\n=Line 167 “Medical images typically exhibit a power law distribution of frequencies, with lower frequency components dominating the image content.” Please give a citation for this bold claim?\n\n### Questions\n\nQ1: Please address each of my issues 1-5. If they are adequately addressed I would be willing to increase my score for the paper accordingly.\n\nEDIT: The reviewers have address my concerns adequately. I have update the score of my review accordingly.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 3",

Experimental results across several datasets indicate consistent improvements over competing methods. The paper is clearly written and presents its ideas in an accessible manner.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Lack of Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper does not include formal proofs or theoretical analysis to justify the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contribution therefore relies entirely on empirical results, which could be insufficient without stronger justification.  \n2. **Significance of Reported Gains:** The reviewer questions whether the reported improvements (3–4% increases) constitute a meaningful advance compared to previous work, noting that for well-studied datasets such as CIFAR-10, incremental improvements at high accuracy levels may not be substantial. The authors should contextualize their gains relative to other recent methods.  \n3. **Code Availability:** The paper states that code will be released upon publication, but no code or supplementary materials are currently available. The reviewer emphasizes the importance of providing an anonymous code repository at submission to ensure transparency and reproducibility.  \n4. **Runtime Analysis:** The manuscript omits discussion of computational cost. A comparison of training time or complexity between the proposed method and baseline approaches would help evaluate efficiency.  \n5. **Terminology Choice:** The use of “good” and “bad” teacher is viewed as overly informal.

On the other hand, parameters are extracted at each layer to achieve multi-scale information fusion, enabling the model to better distinguish between positive and negative samples.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe methodology section of this paper is clearly written and well-presented.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. In terms of innovation, this article presents two components that are commonly seen in other works. A straightforward suggestion would be for the authors to explore a more adaptable data augmentation method to address the issue raised in “Question 1.”\n\n2. Regarding the writing, the **Introduction** section of this article is somewhat confusing. Firstly, the paragraphing is suboptimal. In the second paragraph of the introduction, the author discusses the shortcomings of anomaly detection models based on generation. The third paragraph explains existing work aimed at improving these models, followed by an exploration of the development of self-supervised learning. Although self-supervised learning indeed enriches unsupervised learning within deep learning, the third paragraph would be clearer if it unified these two parts, focusing on how self-supervised learning specifically addresses the issues raised in the second paragraph. Secondly, and more importantly, an excessive portion of the introduction is dedicated to discussing related work, lacking sufficient focus on the contributions of this paper. Maybe you could merging the discussion of existing work and self-supervised learning, followed by a clear transition to the paper's contributions. Additionally, you could recommend what key points about the paper's contributions should be emphasized earlier in the introduction.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In the noise generation process, the intensity of each position is sampled from a uniform distribution. However, in real-world medical imaging, anomalous regions in disease cases appear in specific locations; for example, abnormalities in a chest image typically do not appear outside body regions. For instance, you could suggest incorporating prior knowledge about typical anomaly locations in different types of medical images.\n\n2. Additionally, is each test sample measured at the image level or at the patch level? If it is at the image level, the positive-to-negative anomaly ratio in the dataset is relatively high, which does not quite align with the extremely imbalanced nature of anomaly detection tasks.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 3",

Summary\nThe manuscript proposes a *Scale‑Aware Contrastive Reverse Distillation (SACRD)* approach for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical images. Building on reverse distillation frameworks, the authors introduce (i) a contrastive student–teacher learning strategy that leverages a pair of “clean” and “noisy” teachers to encourage discriminative representations, and (ii) a scale‑adaptation module that dynamically weights loss contributions across feature scales. Synthetic anomalies are generated using *simplex noise* to produce structured perturbations. Evaluated on RSNA chest X‑rays, a brain‑tumor MRI dataset, and the ISIC 2018 dermoscopy dataset, the proposed method achieves state‑of‑the‑art AUC, F1, and accuracy compared with 15+ recent baselines.\n\n### 2. Strengths\n- **Methodological innovation:** Combines contrastive and reverse‑distillation paradigms with scale weighting—an elegant enhancement addressing feature discriminability and scale variation.  \n- **Comprehensive experimentation:** Multiple datasets, ablation studies (contrastive loss, SAM module, noise type and intensity, backbone).  \n- **Strong results:** Reported AUC improvements of 3–4 % vs. best baselines and clear qualitative separation of normal vs. abnormal distributions.  \n- **Good reproducibility:** Public code, detailed architecture, and pseudo‑code.  \n- **Generalizability:** Demonstrated across modalities, reinforcing potential broad utility.  \n\n### 3. Weaknesses\n- **Incremental nature:** Builds directly upon RD4AD/RD++ with architectural tweaks rather than a fundamentally new learning principle; may be near TMI’s lower novelty bound.  \n- **Synthetic anomaly realism:** Simplex noise is a convenient proxy but lacks clinical plausibility; justification or qualitative examples of realism would strengthen claims.  \n- **Statistical validation:** No confidence intervals or significance analyses on AUC differences.  \n- **Limited discussion of failure cases:** Insight into missed anomalies or false‑positives is absent.  \n- **Figure/formatting issues:** Some blurry figures and inconsistent typography.  \n\n### 4. Major Comments\n1. **Novelty positioning:** Clearly delineate conceptual differences from RD++ and ReContrast in the Introduction and Discussion, ideally through a table or schematic emphasizing algorithmic and loss‑function differences rather than implementation details.  \n2. **Statistical analysis:** Include significance testing (e.g., DeLong test) or bootstrapped confidence intervals for AUC to demonstrate robustness of reported improvements.  \n3. **Synthetic anomaly justification:** Provide qualitative comparison of simplex‑noise anomalies versus realistic pathologies; discuss limitations regarding anatomical plausibility.  \n4. **Failure case analysis:** Present sample anomaly maps illustrating false detections or missed lesions to help readers understand boundary conditions of the model.  \n5. **Clinical interpretability:** Comment on how contrastive and scale‑aware representations might translate to localizing pathology or assisting clinician trust.  \n\n### 5. Minor Comments\n- Correct text artifacts and spacing (e.g., “f eature d iscriminability”).  \n- Improve figure legends and resolution.  \n- Standardize abbreviations (e.g., SAM vs. S.A.M.).  \n- Provide exact runtime environment in reproducibility statement (CUDA/cuDNN versions).  \n- Ensure that all referenced works have full bibliographic information (some abbreviations inconsistent).  \n\n### 6.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper proposes a scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model for unsupervised medical anomaly detection. The method addresses two limitations of existing reverse distillation approaches: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. The approach introduces a contrastive student-teacher learning framework with dual encoding pathways - a \"clean\" teacher processing normal data and a \"noisy\" teacher processing synthesized anomalies created using simplex noise (Section 2.2.2). A scale adaptation mechanism generates input-specific weights to handle multi-scale anomalies (Equation 3-4). The method is evaluated on three medical datasets (RSNA, Brain Tumor, ISIC) and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with AUC improvements of 3.01%, 4.38%, and 3.08% respectively over second-best methods (Table 1).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and unclear notation**\n  - Equation 2 presents a ratio-based loss without theoretical justification for why this specific formulation enhances discrimination compared to additive or weighted alternatives\n  - The reshaping operation mentioned in Section 2.2.1 for converting uk and vk to 1D representations lacks mathematical specification of dimensions and aggregation method\n  - The small epsilon value in the denominator (Equation 2) is introduced without analysis of its impact on gradient stability or convergence properties\n  - Scale descriptor normalization in Equation 3 uses softmax, but no justification is provided for why this constraint improves performance over other normalizations\n\n• **Limited experimental rigor and insufficient baseline comparisons**\n  - Table 1 shows inconsistent performance patterns across methods without statistical significance testing or confidence intervals to validate claimed improvements\n  - Ablation study in Table 2 tests only two components, missing analysis of individual contributions of simplex noise type, noise intensity, and architectural choices\n  - The comparison with RD++ in Section 2.5 lacks experimental validation on the same datasets to substantiate claimed fundamental differences\n  - Figure 3 shows noise intensity analysis only on RSNA dataset, missing validation on other datasets where scale variations differ significantly\n\n• **Methodological limitations in synthetic anomaly generation**\n  - Section 2.2.2 uses fixed hyperparameters (γ = 0.6, λ = 0.2, six octaves) for simplex noise without dataset-specific optimization or sensitivity analysis\n  - The assumption that medical anomalies follow power law distributions lacks empirical validation or citation support in the manuscript\n  - Table 3 compares only Gaussian vs. simplex noise, missing comparison with other structured noise types or learnable anomaly synthesis methods\n  - Algorithm 1 shows random spatial sampling for noise placement without consideration of anatomically relevant regions in medical images\n\n• **Incomplete evaluation and limited generalizability analysis**\n  -

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces a scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model for unsupervised medical anomaly detection. The authors propose a novel framework that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. The model incorporates a noisy teacher encoder to generate synthetic anomalies and a scale adaptation mechanism to account for scale variations. The authors evaluate their approach on three datasets—chest X-rays, brain MRI, and dermoscopy—and claim state-of-the-art performance. The manuscript is well-written and the technical details are presented clearly.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The proposed scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model introduces innovative elements such as the noisy teacher encoder and the scale adaptation mechanism. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed discussion on how these contributions differ from existing work, particularly in the context of reverse distillation and contrastive learning. The authors should provide a clearer distinction between their method and recent advancements in these areas.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted on three datasets from different imaging modalities, which is commendable. However, the experimental setup is limited to a specific set of backbone architectures (WideResNet50, ResNet18, ResNet50). Including a broader range of backbones and testing on additional datasets would strengthen the generalizability claims. Additionally, the manuscript should consider providing more qualitative analyses beyond the anomaly score distributions, such as visual comparisons of detected anomalies.\n\n3. Comparisons: The baseline comparisons are thorough, covering a variety of recent methods. However, the manuscript should include a discussion on the computational efficiency and memory usage of the proposed method compared to the baselines. While the authors mention inference time and memory usage, a more detailed analysis would be beneficial, especially considering the clinical relevance of these metrics.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors state that the code will be made available, which is good practice. However, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of certain aspects of the training protocol, such as the exact hyperparameters used for different backbones and the specific data preprocessing steps. Providing a more comprehensive description of the training setup would enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 2 and 3 are somewhat cluttered. Simplifying these figures by showing fewer representative samples or zoomed-in regions would improve readability.\n   \n2. Notation and Terminology: The notation for the forward operator is introduced without sufficient explanation, and some acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition. Clarifying these points would improve the clarity of the manuscript.\n\n3. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" (page 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (page 7) should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge in unsupervised medical anomaly detection, which is crucial for early diagnosis and intervention. The proposed scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model is technically innovative, particularly in its handling of feature discriminability and scale variations. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including a broader range of datasets and backbones. The manuscript provides a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods, but the reproducibility of the approach is somewhat compromised by incomplete methodological details. Overall, the proposed method shows promise, but the current evidence needs to be expanded to fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the evaluation to include a broader range of datasets and backbones, provide more detailed methodological descriptions for reproducibility, and offer a more comprehensive discussion on computational efficiency and memory usage.",

        "text": "## Scale-Aware Contrastive Reverse Distillation for Unsupervised Medical Anomaly Detection\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation framework for unsupervised medical anomaly detection. Building on reverse distillation, the method introduces a dual-teacher setup (clean/noisy inputs with shared weights), a contrastive ratio loss that pulls student features toward clean-teacher features and pushes them away from noisy-teacher features synthesized via simplex noise, and a scale adaptation mechanism that learns input-specific weights over multi-scale features. Experiments on RSNA (X-ray), Brain Tumor (MRI slices), and ISIC 2018 (dermoscopy) report state-of-the-art AUCs and show consistent gains from both contrastive distillation and scale weighting.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntroduces a contrastive reverse distillation objective that explicitly exploits synthetic out-of-normal distributions via a noisy-teacher pathway, conceptually strengthening discriminability relative to standard RD.Proposes a simple, learnable scale adaptation mechanism (GMP + linear + softmax) to reweight per-scale contributions conditioned on the input, addressing a well-known challenge in medical AD (varying lesion sizes).The use of simplex noise as synthetic anomalies is justified by frequency statistics and prior work; ablations on noise type and intensity support the design choice.\n- Experimental rigor and validationCross-modality evaluation (X-ray, MRI, dermoscopy) demonstrates generality and robustness.Ablations isolate the contributions of contrastive reverse distillation and the scale adaptation mechanism; sensitivity to noise intensity is explored.Broad baseline coverage includes reconstruction, memory bank, normalizing flow, SSL-based, and KD/RD-based methods.\n- Clarity of presentationThe overall architecture and training flow are clearly depicted; the roles of clean and noisy teachers and SAM are easy to follow.The ablation tables and noise-sensitivity plot provide actionable insights on design choices (e.g., λ=0.2).\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses two practical shortcomings of RD approaches—limited discriminability and scale variation—both highly relevant in medical imaging.Achieves strong results on three benchmarks with a comparatively simple and computationally efficient architecture, indicating potential for practical deployment.\n\n- Introduces a contrastive reverse distillation objective that explicitly exploits synthetic out-of-normal distributions via a noisy-teacher pathway, conceptually strengthening discriminability relative to standard RD.\n- Proposes a simple, learnable scale adaptation mechanism (GMP + linear + softmax) to reweight per-scale contributions conditioned on the input, addressing a well-known challenge in medical AD (varying lesion sizes).\n- The use of simplex noise as synthetic anomalies is justified by frequency statistics and prior work; ablations on noise type and intensity support the design choice.\n\n- Cross-modality evaluation (X-ray, MRI, dermoscopy) demonstrates generality and robustness.\n- Ablations isolate the contributions of contrastive reverse distillation and the scale adaptation mechanism; sensitivity to noise intensity is explored.\n- Broad baseline coverage includes reconstruction, memory bank, normalizing flow, SSL-based, and KD/RD-based methods.\n\n- The overall architecture and training flow are clearly depicted; the roles of clean and noisy teachers and SAM are easy to follow.\n- The ablation tables and noise-sensitivity plot provide actionable insights on design choices (e.g., λ=0.2).\n\n- Addresses two practical shortcomings of RD approaches—limited discriminability and scale variation—both highly relevant in medical imaging.\n- Achieves strong results on three benchmarks with a comparatively simple and computationally efficient architecture, indicating potential for practical deployment.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe contrastive ratio loss L = (1 − sim(u, v)) / (1 − sim(z, v) + ε) is unusual; it may lead to optimization instability when the denominator becomes small, lacks temperature/margin control, and is not contrasted against more standard objectives (e.g., InfoNCE, triplet with margins).The paper states that features are “reshaped into 1D representations” to compute cosine similarity for stability, which appears inconsistent with later inference-time use of per-pixel (vector-wise) similarity maps; this discrepancy needs clarification.Synthetic anomalies rely on spatially localized simplex noise; the risk of overfitting to a specific synthetic distribution is not deeply analyzed (e.g., robustness to different synthesis regimes or domain shifts).\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesResults are reported largely as single-run without variance or statistical testing; considering dataset variability and unsupervised sensitivity, reporting mean±std over multiple seeds is important.Threshold-dependent metrics (F1/ACC) are computed with the best test-time F1 threshold; this inflates scores. Threshold selection protocols more aligned with deployment (e.g., fixed FPR, validation-free heuristics, or AUCPR/AP) would strengthen claims.No pixel-level localization evaluation is provided despite generating anomaly maps; for MRI and dermoscopy, localization metrics (AUPRC, best-Dice) would be valuable and are increasingly standard.The Brain Tumor dataset merges sources for normal and abnormal slices, raising potential domain-shift confounds; no control experiments (e.g., intensity harmonization, source-balanced splits) are reported.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesConfusion between global vs. spatial cosine similarity during training vs. inference; the bottleneck/decoder dimensionalities and exact mapping to K scales could be more explicit.The definition and effect of the normalization constant Ck in Eq. (1) and how it relates to the proposed loss are not discussed; potential scale imbalance across layers remains unquantified beyond SAM.Some experimental figures/tables (e.g., inference-time/memory bubble chart) lack detailed measurement protocols and could be misinterpreted without standardization.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsRecent KD/distillation advances that explicitly separate normal vs. abnormal modeling (e.g., DMDD 2024) are not discussed; comparisons or conceptual positioning relative to decoupled student branches and more advanced synthesis strategies would contextualize the contribution.The broader MedIAnomaly benchmark observations (e.g., threshold-selection pitfalls, evaluation standards across modalities) are cited but not fully integrated into the evaluation protocol.\n\n- The contrastive ratio loss L = (1 − sim(u, v)) / (1 − sim(z, v) + ε) is unusual; it may lead to optimization instability when the denominator becomes small, lacks temperature/margin control, and is not contrasted against more standard objectives (e.g., InfoNCE, triplet with margins).\n- The paper states that features are “reshaped into 1D representations” to compute cosine similarity for stability, which appears inconsistent with later inference-time use of per-pixel (vector-wise) similarity maps; this discrepancy needs clarification.\n- Synthetic anomalies rely on spatially localized simplex noise; the risk of overfitting to a specific synthetic distribution is not deeply analyzed (e.g., robustness to different synthesis regimes or domain shifts).\n\n- Results are reported largely as single-run without variance or statistical testing; considering dataset variability and unsupervised sensitivity, reporting mean±std over multiple seeds is important.\n- Threshold-dependent metrics (F1/ACC) are computed with the best test-time F1 threshold; this inflates scores.

Consider adding temperature scaling, a margin, or switching to a bounded and well-studied loss (e.g., logistic/InfoNCE: −log exp(sim(u,v)/τ) / [exp(sim(u,v)/τ) + exp(sim(z,v)/τ)]) for stability and interpretability.Clarify whether “reshaped into 1D” means flattening across spatial and channel dimensions, or only across channels per spatial location. If training is global but inference is local, explain why this mismatch improves performance and whether a local contrastive variant was tried.The SAM design is elegant; however, explain why GMP was preferred over GAP or mixed pooling (GMP is sensitive to outliers). Ablate or analyze alternatives and report the learned α distributions and their correlation with lesion sizes across datasets.Anomaly synthesis via simplex noise is reasonable and supported by ablation. Provide qualitative visualizations of synthetic patches and their frequency spectra to further justify realism. Consider mixing scales or multiple procedural textures to reduce overfitting to one synthesis family.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentReport results over multiple random seeds (mean±std). Include AUCPR/AP for imbalanced settings and operating-point metrics like FPR@95%TPR. For image-level scoring, avoid selecting thresholds on the test set; adopt validation-free heuristics or report both “oracle” and “practical” thresholds.Since anomaly maps are produced, evaluate localization on at least one dataset with pixel-level labels (e.g., BraTS variants) or create proxy masks via expert annotations. Even if the focus is classification, localization is a critical clinical desideratum.The Brain Tumor setup risks domain confounds (normals and tumors from different repositories). Provide harmonization steps, source-balanced splits, or a cross-source control to confirm the model is detecting pathology rather than dataset bias.Fairness of baseline comparisons: clarify whether all baselines used the same backbone/input size and pretraining regime when possible. Some baselines (e.g., PatchCore) are sensitive to feature extractors and sampling; specify if you re-trained them or adopted published numbers, and align training budgets if re-running.Image-level score aggregation: you use the mean over the aggregated anomaly map, whereas RD4AD often uses the maximum. Provide an ablation on pooling functions (mean/max/top-k pooling) and post-processing (e.g., Gaussian smoothing) to confirm robustness.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Relative to RD4AD (Deng & Li 2022), your contrastive formulation and SAM are clear extensions; however, explain how your one-class bottleneck and multi-scale fusion relate to OCBE/MFF, and whether your bottleneck mirrors or modifies those modules.RD++ (Tien et al. 2023) uses dual pathways and synthetic anomalies but regularizes reconstruction differently. Your positioning is fair; it would be helpful to include a controlled comparison where both methods share identical backbones, training budgets, and synthesis (simplex) to confirm gains come from the contrastive objective and SAM.DMDD (2024) explicitly decouples normal/abnormal branches and uses foreground-aware synthesis and segmentation heads; while industrial, it is relevant to KD-based AD. Discuss how your simpler loss and SAM compare to dual-branch designs and whether combining SAM with decoupled branches could further improve scale sensitivity.MedIAnomaly (2024) emphasizes evaluation standards; integrating AP/AUCPR and avoiding test-time threshold selection would bring your evaluation in line with those recommendations and strengthen the claims, particularly on ISIC where class semantics can differ broadly.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe method is computationally efficient and could be practical in clinical pipelines, as suggested by the reported inference speeds. To support deployment, consider evaluating robustness to training-set contamination, scanner/site shifts, and calibration of anomaly scores.Ethical and clinical considerations: emphasize that anomaly detection is an assistive tool, not a diagnostic; discuss potential failure modes (e.g., rare pathologies outside the synthetic distribution), uncertainty quantification, and human-in-the-loop integration. Calibration analysis and case studies would increase clinical relevance.\n\n- The contrastive ratio formulation is intuitive but could be analytically grounded: gradients can explode when sim(z, v) approaches 1; adding only ε may not suffice.

Calibration analysis and case studies would increase clinical relevance.\n\n### Questions for Authors\n\n- How exactly is the cosine similarity computed during training: per-spatial-location (channel vectors) or on fully flattened feature maps? If the latter, how do you reconcile this with the spatial anomaly maps used at inference?\n- Why choose the ratio loss rather than a temperature/margin-based contrastive loss (InfoNCE/triplet)? Did you observe instability with your ratio objective (e.g., when sim(z, v) ≈ 1)? Any gradient clipping or auxiliary regularization used?\n- Can you report mean±std over multiple seeds and include AUCPR/AP, FPR@95%TPR, and calibration metrics? Also, how are thresholds chosen in a validation-free manner for F1/ACC in practice?\n- For the Brain Tumor dataset, what steps were taken to mitigate domain shift between normal and abnormal sources? Can you provide a control where normals and abnormals come from the same site/distribution, or show performance with histogram matching/intensity harmonization?\n- Could you share statistics/visualizations of learned α (SAM) across datasets and per sample? Do α distributions correlate with estimated lesion sizes? Have you tried GAP or mixed pooling in SAM?\n- For anomaly synthesis, do you vary patch sizes/shapes beyond uniform sampling up to h/8? Have you tried multi-scale textures, Poisson blending, or learned perturbations to diversify anomalies and reduce overfitting?\n- How were inference time and memory footprints measured across methods (same hardware/batch size/precision)? Were all baselines re-run under the same settings?\n- What is the effect of the image-level pooling choice (mean vs max vs top-k) and any post-processing on anomaly maps? Could you provide an ablation?\n- Have you evaluated pixel-level localization metrics on a dataset with masks (e.g., BraTS variants)? If not, what prevents including this, given your method produces anomaly maps?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper presents a well-motivated and practically useful extension of reverse distillation for medical anomaly detection. The contrastive dual-teacher design and the learned scale adaptation mechanism are conceptually sound and empirically effective across three imaging modalities. The method’s simplicity and efficiency are attractive for real-world settings. The main areas needing strengthening are the theoretical and empirical grounding of the ratio-based contrastive loss (including stability and alternatives), clarifying the spatial vs. global similarity computations, and broadening/standardizing the evaluation (multiple seeds, AUCPR, localization metrics, thresholding protocols) while controlling for dataset/domain confounds, especially in the Brain Tumor setup. Addressing these points would significantly enhance the paper’s rigor and increase its suitability for a top-tier venue. Overall, I view the contribution as novel and valuable, with clear potential after methodological clarifications and evaluation refinements.",

Analytical justification and experiments on training stability are needed.  \n2. **Inconsistency between training and inference similarity computation** – The manuscript reports collapsing features into 1D for training while using per-pixel similarity during inference; this discrepancy requires clarification and potential evaluation of local contrastive alternatives.  \n3. **Synthetic anomaly design** – Reliance on simplex noise makes the model potentially overfit to a specific synthetic distribution. Additional tests under different noise regimes or domains would help judge robustness.  \n4. **Experimental rigor** – Results are single-run without variance reporting. Metrics dependent on optimal test thresholds (F1/ACC) are inflated; mean±std over seeds, AUCPR/AP, and threshold-free evaluations (e.g., fixed FPR) are recommended.  \n5. **Localization and dataset issues** – Despite producing spatial anomaly maps, no localization metrics (AUPRC or Dice) are provided. The Brain Tumor dataset combines normal and abnormal images from different sources, introducing domain-shift confounds that require control experiments.  \n6. **Methodological and presentation clarity** – Details such as the normalization constant \\(C_k\\), mapping to K scales, and dimensionalities are insufficiently specified. Some figure protocols (e.g., memory chart) need clearer definitions.  \n7. **Comparative context** – Missing discussion of recent knowledge-distillation works (e.g., DMDD 2024) and benchmarks (MedIAnomaly 2024) prevents full contextualization. Controlled comparisons with RD++, DMDD, or similar methods sharing backbones and resources would clarify contributions.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify whether SAM uses global or channel pooling and justify the choice of GMP over GAP; report distributions of learned weights and their correlation with lesion size.  \n- Provide visualizations of synthetic anomalies and frequency characteristics.  \n- Verify fairness of baseline settings (backbone, input size, pretraining) and describe hardware consistency for runtime comparisons.  \n- Add ablations on image-level pooling choices (mean vs. max vs. top-k) and evaluation post-processing.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper makes a technically novel and practically meaningful contribution by combining contrastive distillation and scale adaptation for anomaly detection across multiple medical modalities. The work is well-motivated and experimentally comprehensive, with clear gains over baselines. However, its theoretical justification for the custom ratio loss, incomplete reporting practices (variance, threshold independence, localization), and limited discussion of domain and comparative contexts weaken the empirical rigor. Addressing stability analysis, expanding evaluation metrics, controlling dataset biases, and integrating newer comparative baselines would solidify the contribution and reproducibility.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The manuscript presents promising and innovative ideas but requires methodological clarification, additional analyses, and improved evaluation rigor before being suitable for acceptance.",

        "text": "# Review Report for IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of unsupervised medical anomaly detection where labeled abnormal samples are scarce. The authors propose a scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation framework that introduces two key innovations: 1) a contrastive student-teacher learning approach that leverages synthetically generated abnormal samples to enhance feature discriminability, and 2) a scale adaptation mechanism that dynamically weights contrastive losses across different feature scales to handle the scale variation of anomalies. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across three diverse medical imaging datasets (RSNA chest X-rays, Brain Tumor MRI, and ISIC dermoscopy), with improvements of 3.01%, 4.38%, and 3.08% in AUC over the second-best methods on the respective datasets. The approach also shows computational efficiency with competitive inference times, achieving the highest AUROC while being significantly faster than competing methods like PatchCore (6x faster) and GAN Ensemble (4x faster).\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The contrastive reverse distillation paradigm is well-designed and addresses a genuine limitation in existing reverse distillation methods by exploring out-of-distribution representations, which is evident in the improved separation of normal and abnormal distributions shown in Figure 2.\n- The scale adaptation mechanism is a thoughtful addition that addresses the scale variation problem in medical anomalies, with the ablation study (Table 2) demonstrating its particular importance for datasets with highly variable anomaly sizes like Brain Tumor MRI.\n- The experimental validation is comprehensive across three diverse medical imaging datasets, showing consistent performance gains over 16 state-of-the-art methods, which strengthens the generalizability of the approach.\n- The computational efficiency analysis (Figure 4) is particularly valuable for clinical deployment considerations, demonstrating that the method achieves the highest AUROC while maintaining competitive inference times.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper doesn't sufficiently justify why the contrastive loss formulation (Eq. 2) is superior to more standard contrastive learning approaches. The division-based formulation is unusual and lacks theoretical grounding or comparison to alternative contrastive learning implementations that might achieve similar results.\n- While the authors demonstrate that simplex noise outperforms Gaussian noise (Table 3), they don't provide a deeper theoretical or empirical justification for why simplex noise better mimics medical anomalies beyond the qualitative statement that it \"produces smooth, structured randomness.\" A more detailed analysis of noise characteristics would strengthen this key design choice.\n- The synthetic anomaly generation method uses arbitrary uniform sampling of noise position/size without considering anatomical structures or regions more likely to contain abnormalities, which may limit the clinical relevance of the synthesized anomalies. The paper would benefit from a more principled approach to anomaly placement.\n- The paper lacks failure case analysis or discussion of limitations when faced with certain types of anomalies (e.g., diffuse abnormalities, those with appearance similar to normal tissue).\n\n### Minor Comments\n- The description of the contrastive loss could be clearer regarding implementation details such as batch size considerations and how positive/negative pairs are constructed.\n- The ROC curve figures (Figures 5-7) would benefit from confidence intervals to better assess the statistical significance of the performance differences.\n- The comparison with ReContrast (Table 1) shows only marginal differences on some datasets; the paper could more clearly articulate the specific scenarios where the scale adaptation mechanism provides decisive advantages.\n- The bottleneck architecture (Figure 1) could benefit from more detailed description in the methodology section to clarify how multi-scale features are fused.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a clinically important problem - unsupervised medical anomaly detection where labeled abnormal data is scarce. The proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements over existing approaches across multiple medical imaging modalities, suggesting potential clinical impact. The computational efficiency is particularly significant for real-world deployment in medical settings where processing speed matters.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper presents two key innovations - the contrastive reverse distillation framework that leverages synthetic anomalies to improve discrimination, and the scale adaptation mechanism for handling scale variation in anomalies. These address specific limitations in prior work and represent meaningful advances to the reverse distillation paradigm. The approach differs fundamentally from RD++ by using contrastive regularization to enhance feature discrimination rather than restricting anomalous information flow.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is thorough, with testing across three diverse medical imaging datasets, comprehensive ablation studies, and comparison to state-of-the-art methods. The paper also provides detailed analysis of the impact of noise type and intensity. However, the statistical significance of improvements could be more rigorously established (e.g., through statistical tests), and failure case analysis is limited.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides sufficient implementation details including network architecture, training parameters, and code availability. The appendix includes algorithms for data synthesis and training. However, more specific details about the scale adaptation module implementation and exact noise generation parameters would further enhance reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nMinor Revision\n\nThe paper presents a solid contribution to medical anomaly detection with clear innovations and strong empirical results across multiple medical imaging modalities. The main limitations that require addressing are: 1) providing more theoretical justification for the contrastive loss formulation and noise selection, 2) improving the synthetic anomaly generation methodology with anatomical considerations, and 3) adding failure case analysis. With these revisions, the paper would make a valuable contribution to TMI. The authors should also consider adding statistical significance testing to their performance comparisons and clarifying the implementation details of the scale adaptation mechanism.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe authors tackle unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging, motivated by the paucity of labeled abnormal cases. Their experiments span three publicly available datasets: chest X‑rays, brain MRI slices, and dermoscopic photographs. They propose a “scale‑aware contrastive reverse distillation” framework that consists of three components: (i) a clean teacher encoder, (ii) a noisy teacher encoder that receives synthetically perturbed images generated with simplex noise, and (iii) a student decoder that reconstructs multi‑scale feature maps. A scale‑adaptation module produces input‑specific weights that modulate the contrastive loss across encoder layers. At test time, cosine similarity between teacher and student features is weighted by the learned scale descriptors to yield an anomaly map and a global anomaly score. The reported results are AUC = 91.01 % (X‑ray), 98.88 % (MRI), and 83.10 % (dermoscopy), together with corresponding F1 and accuracy figures. The claimed novelty lies in merging contrastive reverse‑distillation with a learnable, scale‑aware weighting mechanism to handle size variability of anomalies.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance.** Detecting anomalies without supervision is indeed a pressing problem in medical imaging where annotated pathology is scarce.  \n- **Innovation.** The manuscript introduces two ideas that are not present in earlier reverse‑distillation works (e.g., RD4AD, RD++): a contrastive reverse‑distillation objective that incorporates a noisy teacher, and a data‑driven scale‑weighting scheme. These concepts also differentiate the method from recent contrastive reconstruction approaches (ReContrast) and synthetic‑anomaly generators (NSA, CutPaste).  \n- **Evaluation.** The authors present quantitative results on three modalities (Table 1, ROC curves in Figs 5‑7) and provide ablation experiments that suggest each component contributes to performance (Table 2). However, the study lacks statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, and an analysis of failure cases. Moreover, the experimental protocol is based on a single train/validation split for each dataset, which raises concerns about the robustness of the reported numbers.  \n- **Reproducibility.** A public GitHub repository and a description of the training setup (backbone, optimizer, 4 k iterations, batch size 16) are supplied (Section 3.1.3). Critical hyper‑parameters—such as the noise intensity λ, the simplex‑noise octaves, and the architecture of the scale‑adaptation module—are insufficiently detailed, and the provided pseudo‑code does not address random‑seed handling.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n- **Loss formulation clarity.** Equation (2) combines two similarity terms but does not include a margin, temperature scaling, or explicit normalization. The only justification for ε is to avoid division‑by‑zero, leaving the overall scaling of the loss ambiguous.  \n- **Scale‑adaptation module details.** The description (“global max pooling → linear layer → softmax”) is too brief. The dimensionality of the bottleneck output, the number of scales K, and the gradient flow through the linear layer are not reported, making it difficult to assess the module’s capacity and stability.  \n- **Synthetic anomaly realism & parameter specification.** While simplex noise is presented as the sole perturbation method, no visual examples of the generated pseudo‑anomalies are included. The manuscript omits the exact ranges for noise size/position ([a, b] bounds), the number of octaves, the persistence γ, and the chosen intensity λ = 0.2, all of which are necessary for reproduction.  \n- **Dataset split reproducibility.** The paper does not fully describe whether patient‑level or study‑level splits were used for RSNA, Brain‑Tumor, and ISIC. Without explicit leakage prevention measures, the reported performance may be over‑optimistic.  \n- **Statistical analysis.** Gains such as “+3.01 % AUC on RSNA” are presented without confidence intervals or p‑values, so it is unclear whether these improvements are statistically meaningful.  \n- **Ablation granularity.** Table 2 contrasts the full model with versions lacking either the contrastive reverse distillation (CRD) or the scale‑adaptation module (SAM). Intermediate configurations (e.g., noisy teacher without contrastive loss, or contrastive loss without scale weighting) are absent, limiting insight into the independent contribution of each component.  \n- **Computational cost reporting.** Figure 4 shows inference time and memory usage qualitatively, but the manuscript does not provide absolute training time, GPU memory consumption during training, or FLOP counts. The claim of being “6× faster than PatchCore” lacks hardware specifications and benchmark details.  \n- **Baseline fairness.** For several baselines (NSA, CutPaste, ReContrast) the authors appear to have used default hyper‑parameters without any dataset‑specific tuning, which may compromise the fairness of the comparison.  \n- **Clinical relevance & visualisation.** Apart from a histogram in Figure 2, the paper does not present localized anomaly maps or qualitative assessments by clinical experts. Such visual evidence would be essential to substantiate the claimed clinical applicability.  \n- **Typographical and formatting errors.** The title contains broken words (“CONTRASTIVE REVERSE DISTILLA## TION”, “DE‑ TECTION”), and numerous formatting issues are scattered throughout the manuscript, detracting from overall readability.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision**  \n\n*Rationale:* The manuscript presents an interesting idea but falls short in several critical aspects: baseline comparisons are not sufficiently controlled, statistical analyses are absent, and many implementation details needed for reproducibility are missing. These deficiencies must be addressed before the work can be considered for publication.",

We address this by creating a representation learning method that instead anticipates strong domain shifts at training time itself. We first propose a data engine that synthesizes highly variable training samples that would enable generalization to new biomedical contexts. To then train a single 3D network for any voxel-level task, we develop a contrastive learning method that pretrains the network to be stable against nuisance imaging variation simulated by the data engine, a key inductive bias for generalization. This network's features can be used as robust representations of input images for downstream tasks and its weights provide a strong, _dataset-agnostic_ initialization for finetuning on new datasets. As a result, we set new standards across _both_ multimodality registration and few-shot segmentation, a first for any 3D biomedical vision model, all without (pre-)training on any existing dataset of real images.",

The proposed pre-training strategy has 3 main steps: 1) Given a large datasets of 104 annotated organs, randomly sample anatomies, deform them and create a volume by ensembling these anatomies, 2) add noise and other augmentations to the volumes that are sampled in the previous step to simulate realistic looking synthetic medical images from labels, 3) train a U-Net with a contrastive objective by sampling two volumes that share the same 3D semantic layout but differ in appearance, treating corresponding features at different encoder levels as positives and all others as negatives. The pre-trained backbone is validated on two different tasks: 3D registration and 3D few-shot segmentation; using multiple datasets.  The results show the effectiveness of the proposed backbone in the experiments compared to existing methods.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Foundational models are showing promising performance lately; however, we lack of a 3D model that work across different modalities in medical imaging. The paper proposes a solution to this important problem using domain randomisation and contrastive learning.\n- The paper contain experiments on multiple datasets both for registration and few shot segmentation, and the results demonstrate the potential of the method.\n- The idea of combining the ideas of domain randomisation and local contrastive learning to train a generic 3D backbone is quite interesting and, to my knowledge, is novel.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- One issue I see in the paper is the convoluted description of the data engine step, especially the part creating the label ensemble model in section 3. I understand that this step is mainly based on the domain randomisation idea proposed in the literature. However, it is not really clear to me the steps between 201-207, especially the parts multiplying the masks with a randomly deformed sphere and randomly encasing half of the foreground-masked volumes.\n\n- The images generated in the data engine step do not seem like as real medical images. Do they look like this because the deformation is too large? It is not clear why one would prefer training the model using such unrealistic images.\n\n- The paper does not discuss the recent foundational models that show better generalization performance on many medical image datasets [1]. The downstream task performance of the representations obtained from the proposed backbone should be compared with the those obtained by the representations of a foundational model (e.g. DinoV2 [2]). For example, [3] is a recent paper that uses DinoV2 features for registration; but the same applies for the segmentation experiments. One can use the DinoV2 features for segmentation.\n\n[1] Cekmeceli et al. \"Do Vision Foundation Models Enhance Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation?\"\n[2] Oquab et al. \"DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision\"\n[3] Song et al. \"DINO-Reg: General Purpose Image Encoder for Training-Free Multi-modal Deformable Medical Image Registration\"\n\n### Questions\n\n1- What are the exact steps of the \"label ensemble model\" described in Section 3? Please write elaborate description of these steps.\n2- Why do the generated images not look like real medical images? Is it because the deformation is too large? Why such \"unrealistic\" looking images are preferred rather than more realistic ones obtained with smaller deformation?\n3- How does the quality of the representations obtained by the proposed backbone compares with SoTA foundational models such as DinoV2 or SAM2?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis work proposes a pre-training approach for downstream tasks related to fine-grained volumetric medical data: image registration and semantic segmentation. The authors propose to learn appearance invariance and shapes of human anatomy through synthetic dense pixel volumes. In this process, 3D volumes are synthesized by randomly recomposing 3D anatomical shapes and assigning multiple sets of random pixel values, in together with synthetic noises and deformations. Pairs of synthetic volumes are used for multi-scale contrastive learning. The proposed approach demonstrates improved image registration and low-shot image segmentation results compared to some previous works. Detailed ablation studies on the pre-training configurations toward downstream performances are conducted.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe overall methodology is straightforward and easy to understand. It echoes with the classical computer vision concept of invariance learning in the deep neural network era (although learned through a data-driven approach).\n\nImproved image registration results on two public image registration benchmarks and image segmentation performance on six image segmentation datasets are shown, compared to those of some existing works. \n\nThe paper is well-written with sufficient clarity. The illustrations are self-explanatory. Readers will enjoy reading it.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nTechnical novelty: The core idea behind the approach is to leverage data-driven approach to learn invariance to pixel values through paired synthetic shapes and different pixel values, and to learn semantic-independent shape representation through random geometric (real-world and pure synthetic) shapes – both key ideas come from the well-established SynthMorph (random Ising shapes with random intensity + synthetic deformation for training registration networks.

The data generation method consists of drawing samples from a semantically labelled repository of biomedical shape templates to randomly populate an empty 3D volume. The volume is then deformed. Empty space and organ 'envelopes' are also simulated. To simulate different modalities and protocols, random intensity transformation is applied to the deformed 3D volume to yield 2 images. Typical imaging artifacts such a sbias field and blurring are simulated through random augmentations.The two images are fed into a UNet, and contrastive pre-training is performed on features at each decoder layer. An anchor point is chosen in one of the images, and all voxels of that label in both images are considered positive, and everything else negative pairs. The network yields features that can be used to finetune on other modalities and tasks. Importantly, the representations are modality-agnostic and anatomy-agnostic.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The paper is very well written - it lays out the prior work and puts the contirbute in context.\n* The approach yields representations that are both modality-agnostic and task-agnostic while removing the need for dataset-specific and anatomy-specific pre-training.\n* Authors present results of several downstream tasks using their features including multi-modality registration image registration and few-shot segmentation on which their method outperform the others compared.\n* Authors perform ablation studies on the various components of their pipeilne.\n* The Authors present extensive visualization and quantitative results in their main text, and supplementary material. Algorithms and parameters are clearly presented too which allows for further scrutiny and improved reproducability.\n* Authors are aware of the limitations of their approach and include these in the paper.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n* The segmentation task performed using the Authors features may yield better results than the other methods that are compared, however the result still misses significant portions of the anatomical regions they aim to segment. The features require further adjustment and extensive fine-tuning to be useful in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n### Questions\n\n* Authors compare their randomized shape template-based synthetic data engine to one that uses data with no biomedical priors and one using brain regions. Can Authors elaborate more on the intuiton for why their randomly deformed template shapes are so effective? Is there some point at which the extent of the deformation causes the representations to be less useful?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses the challenge of limited generalization in volumetric biomedical foundation models due to small and domain-specific 3D datasets. The authors propose a representation learning framework combining: (1) a synthetic data engine that generates highly variable training samples using randomized compositions of biomedical shape templates from TotalSegmentator (Section 3, Figure 2), and (2) a contrastive learning method that pretrains a 3D UNet to be stable against nuisance imaging variation while preserving semantic consistency (Equation 1, Figure 3). The method trains exclusively on synthetic data without using any real biomedical images. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised multimodality registration across L2RAb and MM-WHS datasets (Figure 5, Table 2) and competitive few-shot segmentation results across six diverse datasets (Table 1), establishing the first 3D biomedical foundation model capable of both registration and segmentation tasks.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation lacks precision and completeness**\n  - The contrastive loss definition in Equation 1 uses ambiguous notation where spatial indices are pooled from both volumes (I = {1,...,2HWD}) but the relationship between indices across V1 and V2 is unclear, making reproducibility difficult\n  - The positive set P(i) definition assumes label correspondence across volumes but doesn't specify how spatial alignment is maintained during geometric augmentations, creating potential training inconsistencies\n  - Temperature parameter τ = 0.33 deviates significantly from standard contrastive learning values (typically 0.07-0.1) but lacks theoretical justification or sensitivity analysis in the main text\n\n• **Experimental evaluation has significant methodological limitations**\n  - Registration baselines exclude recent deep learning methods like VoxelMorph variants that could provide stronger comparisons, limiting the scope of performance claims (Section 4.1)\n  - Few-shot segmentation uses only 1-3 training volumes per dataset (Table 1), which may not reflect realistic clinical deployment scenarios where more data is typically available\n  - Cross-validation or multiple random splits are not reported, raising questions about statistical significance and generalizability of the Dice improvements shown in Table 1\n  - The MM-WHS dataset required substantial preprocessing including custom spine annotations (Appendix B.4.4), potentially introducing evaluation bias\n\n• **Limited technical novelty and insufficient analysis of design choices**\n  - The synthetic data engine primarily combines existing techniques (Dead Leaves model, domain randomization) with biomedical templates, offering incremental rather than fundamental innovation (Section 2, Page 3)\n  - Ablation studies in Table 3 show relatively small performance differences between design choices, questioning the necessity of the proposed complexity\n  - The choice of TotalSegmentator templates introduces potential bias toward CT-based anatomical structures, but impact on MRI-heavy datasets is not thoroughly analyzed\n  - Feature visualization in Figure 1 lacks quantitative stability metrics, relying only on qualitative assessment of cross-modal consistency\n\n• **Insufficient baseline comparisons and evaluation scope**\n  - Comparison with 2D foundation models like DINOv2 is relegated to appendix (Table 8) despite their widespread adoption in medical imaging, understating competitive landscape\n  - Large-scale medical foundation models comparison (SuPreM in Table 9) shows the proposed method's advantages are modest, questioning practical significance\n  - Registration experiments lack comparison with learning-based multimodal registration methods that could leverage similar synthetic training strategies\n  - The multitask evaluation in Table 2 tests only one additional task (registration), insufficient to claim general-purpose capabilities\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and strengthen mathematical formulations**\n  - Provide explicit spatial correspondence mechanism between V1 and V2 indices in Equation 1, including how geometric augmentations preserve label alignment during training\n  - Add theoretical analysis or empirical justification for the τ = 0.33 choice, including comparison with standard contrastive learning temperatures\n  - Include algorithmic pseudocode for the complete contrastive training procedure to ensure reproducibility\n\n• **Enhance experimental rigor and scope**\n  - Include recent deep learning registration baselines (e.g., VoxelMorph variants, TransMorph) to provide comprehensive performance comparison\n  - Expand few-shot evaluation to include 5-10 training volumes scenarios that better reflect clinical reality\n  - Report confidence intervals and statistical significance tests across multiple random dataset splits for all major results\n  - Validate registration performance on standard datasets without custom preprocessing to ensure fair comparison\n\n• **Strengthen technical contributions and analysis**\n  - Conduct systematic ablation study comparing synthetic vs. real label sources with quantitative stability metrics beyond visual inspection\n  - Analyze the impact of TotalSegmentator's CT bias on different imaging modalities with dedicated experiments\n  - Provide theoretical framework connecting synthetic data diversity to downstream generalization performance\n  - Include quantitative feature stability analysis (e.g., mutual information, correlation) to supplement Figure 1 visualizations\n\n• **Expand baseline comparisons and evaluation comprehensiveness**\n  - Move DINOv2 and large-scale foundation model comparisons to main text with detailed analysis of when synthetic pretraining outperforms real data approaches\n  - Include learning-based multimodal registration methods trained on synthetic data for direct comparison\n  - Evaluate on additional tasks (e.g., classification, detection) to substantiate general-purpose claims beyond registration and segmentation\n  - Provide computational cost analysis comparing synthetic pretraining with real data collection and annotation efforts",

A data engine composes randomly deformed anatomical label templates into 3D “label ensembles” and synthesizes paired volumes with shared geometry but independently randomized appearances; a multi-positive, multi-scale supervised contrastive loss trains the network to be invariant to nuisance variation. Without using any real images for pretraining, the learned features substantially improve training-free multimodality registration when plugged into ANTs and ConvexAdam, and the pretrained weights consistently boost few-shot 3D segmentation across diverse datasets.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe label ensemble model that composes and deforms real anatomical templates to create diverse 3D layouts is a compelling twist on domain randomization beyond brain-only settings.The multi-positive, label-supervised, dense contrastive pretraining across two synthetic “views” with shared geometry directly targets appearance invariance and pose equivariance at voxel level.Training a single 3D network to serve both registration (as a feature metric) and segmentation (via fine-tuning) represents a meaningful, multitask contribution for 3D biomedical vision.\n- Experimental rigor and validationStrong gains in multimodality registration on L2RAb MR-CT and MM-WHS using standard solvers, replacing intensities with learned features.Consistent few-shot segmentation improvements over diverse baselines across multiple datasets and modalities, including an out-of-distribution fetal BOLD set.Ablations examining temperature, label sources, loss design, and augmentations enhance confidence in design choices.\n- Clarity of presentationMethod and data-engine components are described clearly and intuitively, with figures that help visualize invariance properties of learned features.A succinct loss formulation and a clean pipeline (paired synthesis, shared-geometry augmentations, multi-scale contrast) help reproducibility.\n- Significance of contributionsDemonstrates that purely synthetic pretraining can yield useful 3D features for disparate downstream biomedical tasks, reducing reliance on scarce annotated or even unannotated real data.Provides a practical path to plug learned features into classical registration solvers, which can have immediate impact.\n\n- The label ensemble model that composes and deforms real anatomical templates to create diverse 3D layouts is a compelling twist on domain randomization beyond brain-only settings.\n- The multi-positive, label-supervised, dense contrastive pretraining across two synthetic “views” with shared geometry directly targets appearance invariance and pose equivariance at voxel level.\n- Training a single 3D network to serve both registration (as a feature metric) and segmentation (via fine-tuning) represents a meaningful, multitask contribution for 3D biomedical vision.\n\n- Strong gains in multimodality registration on L2RAb MR-CT and MM-WHS using standard solvers, replacing intensities with learned features.\n- Consistent few-shot segmentation improvements over diverse baselines across multiple datasets and modalities, including an out-of-distribution fetal BOLD set.\n- Ablations examining temperature, label sources, loss design, and augmentations enhance confidence in design choices.\n\n- Method and data-engine components are described clearly and intuitively, with figures that help visualize invariance properties of learned features.\n- A succinct loss formulation and a clean pipeline (paired synthesis, shared-geometry augmentations, multi-scale contrast) help reproducibility.\n\n- Demonstrates that purely synthetic pretraining can yield useful 3D features for disparate downstream biomedical tasks, reducing reliance on scarce annotated or even unannotated real data.\n- Provides a practical path to plug learned features into classical registration solvers, which can have immediate impact.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe pretraining label bank is derived from TotalSegmentator (adult torso CT), which may bias shape statistics toward certain anatomies; fetal and neuroanatomy are less represented.Potential class-imbalance during voxel sampling (e.g., background dominance) is not discussed; no explicit positive/negative balancing strategy is described.The use of only shared geometric transforms may limit training-induced equivariance to a subset of transformations; explicit equivariance regularization is not explored.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesRegistration validation relies on small test suites with minimal validation data (e.g., 1/7 split on L2RAb), raising risk of overfitting solver hyperparameters.Baseline comparisons for registration omit strong modern 3D feature extractors (e.g., SAM‑Med3D or TotalSegmentator features) and recent training-free semantic metrics (e.g., IMPACT-style features), which would further contextualize the advantage.Few-shot segmentation baselines have heterogeneous parameter counts and training recipes; while the authors tune augmentations and iterations, fairness controls (e.g., matched backbones) are limited to a subset of baselines.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesImportant implementation details are scattered to the appendix: number of output channels used across tasks, sampling strategy across labels/voxels, and distributions of “templates per volume.”Runtime/compute footprint for pretraining (600k iters), and inference overhead when integrating features into registration are not reported.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited discussion of recent general-purpose 3D promptable segmenters (e.g., SAM‑Med3D) and of repurposing pretrained segmentation features for registration (as in recent semantic registration metrics).Connections to related volumetric pretraining frameworks (e.g., MACL) and to fetal-specific domain randomization methods (e.g., DRIFTS/FetalSynthSeg) could be expanded to situate contributions relative to nearest neighbors.\n\n- The pretraining label bank is derived from TotalSegmentator (adult torso CT), which may bias shape statistics toward certain anatomies;

Using the loss at multiple decoder layers encourages multiscale consistency.The choice of a higher contrastive temperature (τ ≈ 0.33) is empirically justified; ablations show lower τ leads to aliasing/degenerate features, aligning with intuition that negatives are uniformly “hard” under strong randomization.Two aspects merit clarification: (i) sampling fairness across labels and background in the dense InfoNCE (to avoid dominance of large classes), and (ii) whether any spatial mines or hard-negative sampling were used to stabilize training.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentRegistration: Using features in ANTs and ConvexAdam is a convincing testbed; consistent Dice gains while keeping fold rates under standard thresholds suggest the features deliver semantically meaningful similarity. However, the datasets are small (especially L2RAb validation), so adding more pairs or cross-dataset validation would strengthen claims.Segmentation: Few-shot regimes across six datasets and modalities, with bootstrapped means/SDs, provide breadth. The consistent top-2 performance, despite using fewer parameters, supports generalization claims. Reporting per-structure breakdowns (at least in the appendix) and multi-seed variability would further strengthen the analysis.Ablations: The comparisons against alternative label sources (smshapes, Brains), loss variants (denoising, intensity-only SSL), and augmentation removals are valuable and generally support the design. It would help to also ablate the number of label templates per volume and envelope layers to directly tie structure richness to downstream performance.Efficiency: The paper would benefit from reporting training wall-clock, inference latency for feature extraction, and registration runtime overhead compared to standard intensity-based runs.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Relative to SynthSeg/DRIFTS-style domain randomization (brain-focused, segmentation-centric), this work generalizes label composition to broader anatomy and learns task-agnostic features that transfer to registration. DRIFTS’ insights on randomized GMMs and weight-space interpolation could inspire future extensions that balance OOD robustness with in-domain accuracy.Compared to ContraReg and other registration-specific representation learning, this method is dataset-agnostic and training-free at deployment, while ContraReg/related approaches are dataset-specific and tuned per task. The trade-off is fewer task-specific optimizations but broader applicability.MACL targets volumetric segmentation with multi-level contrast, but relies on real unlabeled upstream data and remains task-focused; here, the synthetic-only, multitask nature is a differentiator.IMPACT-style recent work demonstrates that repurposed pretrained segmentation encoders can serve as universal registration metrics; directly comparing your features to those extracted from large 3D segmentation foundation models (e.g., TotalSegmentator network or SAM‑Med3D) within the same ANTs/ConvexAdam pipelines would provide a valuable reference point.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe approach can materially reduce dependence on scarce or siloed medical data for pretraining, encouraging wider sharing and reproducibility. It also provides a path to robust, plug-and-play features for classical registration pipelines.A limitation the authors note is important: intensity- or texture-driven tasks may not benefit from intensity-invariant pretraining. Explicitly documenting such boundaries will help practitioners select appropriate initializations.Ethically, training without real images mitigates privacy concerns. However, shape priors derived from public labels may still reflect population biases (e.g., adult anatomy predominance), warranting careful extension to pediatric, fetal, or non-human domains.\n- Additional suggestionsReport channel counts used for registration and whether per-voxel feature normalization (e.g., L2) or whitening is applied; consider PCA or feature selection to analyze which channels drive gains.Explore complementary equivariance regularizers (e.g., small SE(3) perturbations) to further solidify pose behavior.Provide a qualitative failure analysis for cases where registration or segmentation underperforms, to guide future refinement of the data engine (e.g., augmentations, label mixing strategies).Consider testing features on ultrasound or challenging artifact-heavy domains to evaluate robustness beyond MR/CT.\n\n- The loss design is sound: positives are all voxels sharing the same label across two views with shared geometry and independently randomized appearances, thereby driving appearance invariance and spatial coherence.

Are features per-voxel L2-normalized or otherwise standardized before being passed to the solver?\n- How are anchor/positive/negative voxels sampled with respect to class balance? Is the background label down-weighted or excluded to avoid dominating the loss?\n- What is the distribution of “templates per synthetic label ensemble” and the typical number/widths of envelope labels? Did downstream results vary with these hyperparameters?\n- Can you report compute footprint: pretraining wall-clock/GPU-hours, and average inference time and memory overhead when integrating your features into ANTs/ConvexAdam?\n- Did you evaluate registration performance using features from large 3D segmentation models (e.g., TotalSegmentator or SAM‑Med3D) within the same ANTs/ConvexAdam pipelines? How do your features compare?\n- Are there any overlaps in subjects between the TotalSegmentator label bank used for pretraining and the evaluation datasets (e.g., AMOS-CT organs overlap at class level)? While images are not used, could label set overlap bias results?\n- How sensitive are results to the number of sampled indices per decoder layer (512) and to the decoder layers chosen? Would increasing samples or adding encoder-level losses change the trade-off between registration and segmentation performance?\n- Have you explored explicit equivariance regularization (e.g., enforcing consistency under small rotations/translations) in addition to shared geometric augmentations?\n- For tasks reliant on intensity or texture, can the framework be adapted (e.g., via curriculum or mixed objectives) to retain some intensity sensitivity?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is a thoughtfully designed and timely contribution that demonstrates the surprising breadth of what synthetic, domain-randomized volumetric pretraining can deliver: robust, task-agnostic 3D features that meaningfully improve multimodality registration and few-shot segmentation without using real images for pretraining. The data engine and the multi-positive, multi-scale contrastive loss are well-aligned with the invariances required for cross-domain generalization, and the empirical results are compelling across multiple datasets with solid ablations. The main areas to strengthen before top-tier publication are (i) broader and more contemporary baselines for registration that use pretrained semantic features (e.g., SAM‑Med3D/TotalSegmentator encoders or IMPACT-style metrics), (ii) deeper reporting on compute and runtime, and (iii) clarifications on sampling, class balance, and sensitivity to pretraining hyperparameters. Addressing these points would significantly bolster the paper’s positioning and reproducibility. Overall, I view this work as a strong step toward general-purpose volumetric biomedical representations and recommend acceptance after the suggested enhancements.",

Opening Paragraph\n\nThe paper addresses a critical challenge in medical imaging: the limited generalizability of current volumetric biomedical foundation models due to small and narrow public 3D datasets that fail to capture the broad diversity of medical procedures, conditions, anatomical regions, and imaging protocols. The authors propose a novel framework that learns general-purpose biomedical volume representations using a synthetic data engine that generates highly diverse training samples combined with a contrastive learning approach that trains networks to be stable against nuisance imaging variations. The key innovation is that the method requires no pretraining on real medical images, instead leveraging randomized synthesis of biomedical structures. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art results across multiple tasks (multimodality registration and few-shot segmentation) and diverse datasets (abdominal MRI/CT, cardiac MRI/CT, fetal MRI), showing that their synthetic-data-pretrained network provides robust, domain-agnostic features that outperform existing foundation models in multitask capabilities.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The synthetic data engine is exceptionally well-designed with medical considerations, effectively generating diverse training samples that capture the variability in biomedical imaging while avoiding dependence on specific real datasets\n- The paper demonstrates impressive multitask capabilities, showing strong performance across both registration (Figs. 4-5) and segmentation (Table 1, Fig. 6) with the same pretrained model\n- The extensive ablation studies (Table 3, Figs. 7, 10) provide valuable insights into design choices and validate the importance of each component of the framework\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The claim of \"no pretraining on any existing dataset of real images\" needs clarification since the TotalSegmentator dataset (whose segmentations are used as templates) originates from real CT images, though the authors correctly note they don't use the actual intensity images\n- The computational requirements of the synthetic data generation and training process are not discussed, which is important for practical adoption in resource-constrained medical settings\n- The paper would benefit from more discussion about failure cases or specific limitations beyond the brief mention of tasks relying on relative intensities (e.g., Nakamura et al., 2017)\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The visualization of network features across different modalities (Fig. 1) effectively demonstrates the stability of the learned representations to domain shifts\n- The comparison with multiple baselines across different datasets provides strong evidence of the method's generalizability, particularly the consistent outperformance in multitask settings (Table 2)\n- The detailed implementation of the data engine (Fig. 2, Appendix B.1) enables understanding of the synthetic generation process\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Some additional architectural details beyond Table 10 (e.g., specific hyperparameters for the MLP projection heads) would strengthen reproducibility\n- The paper could better contextualize how this approach compares to adapting natural image foundation models (e.g., DINOv2) for medical imaging, beyond the brief Appendix A.7\n- The \"temperature\" hyperparameter analysis (Fig. 11) shows interesting tradeoffs between registration and segmentation performance that warrant more discussion\n\n## 3. Evaluation Along TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance (High):** The work addresses a fundamental limitation in medical AI - the lack of generalizable models due to narrow datasets - with potential to transform how biomedical foundation models are developed. The approach could significantly reduce the need for extensive reannotation and retraining when adapting to new clinical contexts, directly addressing a major bottleneck in medical AI deployment.\n\n**Innovation (High):** The paper presents highly innovative concepts: using synthetic data with medical priors as the sole pretraining source, a data engine specifically designed for biomedical variability, and contrastive learning with inductive biases for medical domain shifts. The demonstration that synthetic-data-only pretraining can outperform models trained on real medical images is particularly novel.\n\n**Evaluation (High):** The evaluation is comprehensive, spanning multiple tasks (registration and segmentation), diverse datasets (6+ distinct biomedical contexts), and extensive ablation studies. The comparisons with appropriate baselines (Table 1, Fig. 5) are well-designed, and the visualization of feature stability (Fig. 1) provides qualitative support for the quantitative results. The inclusion of both registration and segmentation tasks demonstrates true multitask capabilities.\n\n**Reproducibility (Good):** The paper provides detailed methodology, including the synthetic data generation process (Figs. 2, 12), training procedures (Appendix B), and ablation studies. The authors' commitment to releasing code, tutorials, and model weights (stated in the abstract) should enable reproduction. However, some additional implementation details (e.g., exact training time, GPU requirements) would further strengthen reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision**\n\nWhile this paper presents a highly innovative and significant contribution to biomedical foundation models, several issues require addressing before acceptance. The most critical is clarifying the \"no real images\" claim to more precisely characterize the relationship between the synthetic data engine and the source segmentations. The paper should also include computational requirements and expand the discussion of limitations and failure cases. Additional details about model architecture and training would strengthen reproducibility. These revisions would enhance an already strong paper that demonstrates substantial advances in creating truly general-purpose biomedical vision models. The core methodology and results are sound, and with these clarifications, the paper would represent an important contribution to the field.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the well‑known problem that volumetric biomedical models often fail to generalise because the available 3‑D datasets are small and narrowly focused. To address this, the authors construct a synthetic data engine that creates a large collection of label ensembles from thousands of anatomical templates and then samples paired volumes with a wide range of appearances, resolutions, and imaging physics. A 3‑D UNet is pretrained with a multi‑positive supervised contrastive loss that forces voxels sharing the same synthetic label to produce consistent feature representations across the two generated views. This pretraining yields features that are invariant to appearance, equivariant to pose, and largely independent of any particular dataset. Experimental results indicate that the learned representations improve multimodal MRI–CT registration Dice scores by up to 11 percentage points while keeping folding rates low, and that fine‑tuning the pretrained weights enables few‑shot segmentation performance comparable to, or exceeding, that of larger foundation models on several organ and modality benchmarks. The central contribution is a contrastive pretraining framework driven entirely by synthetic data, which produces general‑purpose 3‑D biomedical features without needing real images.  \n\n---  \n\n**## General feedback**  \n\n- **Significance** – The work confronts a crucial bottleneck: the scarcity of annotated 3‑D medical data. Demonstrating that synthetic‑only pretraining can generate representations that transfer to both registration and segmentation suggests a potentially broad impact across downstream clinical tasks.  \n\n- **Innovation** – The paper merges large‑scale label‑ensemble generation (a “dead‑leaves” style composition of organ masks) with dense, multi‑layer contrastive learning that exploits exact synthetic voxel labels. This combination is, to my knowledge, new in the 3‑D biomedical literature, where prior methods have either relied on real label maps or focused on a single downstream objective.  \n\n- **Evaluation** – The authors present an extensive experimental suite covering two multimodal registration benchmarks (Learn2Reg‑Abdomen MR‑CT [L2RAb] and MM‑WHS) and six few‑shot segmentation datasets (MSD‑Heart, PROMISE12, L2RAb‑MRI, FeTA, AMOS‑CT, WUFetal). Their results consistently place the proposed method in the top‑one or top‑two positions (see Table 1, Fig. 6), and the ablation studies explore label sources, temperature τ, and alternative pretraining losses (Table 3, Fig. 7). However, the manuscript does not provide statistical significance testing (e.g., p‑values or confidence intervals), and it omits comparisons with the most recent 2‑D foundation models.  \n\n- **Reproducibility** – Implementation details are described thoroughly (Algorithm 1, Tables 10 and 12, hyper‑parameter settings). The code repository and pretrained weights are made available, yet the lack of exact random seeds, training duration, hardware specifications, and licensing information makes exact replication of the synthetic data pipeline difficult.  \n\n---  \n\n**## Specific comments / critiques**  \n\n1. **Synthetic label diversity** – The label ensembles are built exclusively from organ masks supplied by TotalSegmentator. The manuscript does not assess how the absence of pathological or rare anatomical structures might affect performance; the only related ablation compares “Brains” with “smshapes” (Table 3).  \n\n2. **Quantifying feature invariance** – Figure 1 offers a qualitative illustration of feature stability across modalities, but no quantitative metric (e.g., intra‑class variance, mutual information) is reported to substantiate the claim of modality‑invariant representations.  \n\n3. **Contrastive temperature analysis** – While Figure 7 and Table 3 show that varying τ degrades feature quality, downstream effects on registration and segmentation are only presented for τ = 0.07, 0.20, 0.33. A broader sweep would help identify the optimal temperature range more confidently.  \n\n4. **Scaling of registration channels** – When the 16‑channel features are incorporated into ANTs and ConvexAdam, they are multiplied by a factor of 0.1 (see B.4.2) without justification or sensitivity analysis. Different scaling factors or channel selections could influence the reported gains.  \n\n5. **Ablation of augmentations** – The synthetic volume pipeline includes many augmentations (bias fields, Gibbs ringing, gamma shifts, etc.). Table 3 reports only cumulative ablations (removing the foreground mask, offline augmentations, or all augmentations). The individual contribution of each augmentation remains unclear.  \n\n6. **Few‑shot fine‑tuning protocol** – All segmentation baselines are fine‑tuned for 37.5 k iterations with every layer unfrozen. The impact of fewer training iterations, linear probing, or varying the number of annotated volumes is not examined, despite a brief mention that linear probing was considered (Sec. 4.2).  \n\n7. **Negative result on neurite‑OASIS** – Table 6 shows no improvement on the OASIS adult brain dataset. The manuscript does not analyse why the synthetic pretraining fails in this high‑resolution, low‑variability scenario.  \n\n8. **Multitask registration comparison** – Table 2 evaluates only ANTs‑MutualInfo as a baseline for multitask capability; other foundation models (e.g., SMIT, PrimGeoSeg) are not tested with the same registration solver, limiting the fairness of the comparison.  \n\n9. **Licensing and availability** – The code URL (https://www.neeldey.com/anatomix/) is provided, but the repository link, the precise license, and confirmation that the synthetic data generation scripts and pretrained weights are publicly downloadable are not verified.  \n\n---  \n\n**## A suggested decision**  \n\n**Major Revision** – The manuscript presents a promising approach, but it currently lacks essential baselines, statistical validation, and several clarifications needed for reproducibility. Substantial revisions are required before the work can be accepted.",

To mitigate this, the authors propose a synthetic data engine that generates large ensembles of labeled anatomical volumes with varied appearance, resolution, and imaging physics. A 3‑D UNet is pretrained using a multi‑positive supervised contrastive loss, encouraging voxel features to remain consistent across paired synthetic views. Experiments indicate that this synthetic pretraining improves multimodal MRI–CT registration and few‑shot segmentation performance, producing features invariant to appearance and pose. The work’s central contribution is a fully synthetic, contrastive pretraining framework that yields broadly transferable 3‑D biomedical representations without requiring real data.  \n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Significance and novelty** – The approach tackles data scarcity in 3‑D medical imaging by demonstrating that synthetic‑only pretraining can yield transferable features. The combination of large‑scale label‑ensemble generation and dense voxel‑wise contrastive learning appears novel for 3‑D biomedical applications.  \n2. **Evaluation scope** – Experiments cover multiple registration and segmentation benchmarks and include meaningful ablations. However, no statistical significance testing is reported, and comparisons with recent 2‑D foundation models are missing.  \n3. **Reproducibility** – While architecture, hyperparameters, and ablation details are extensive, replication is hindered by absent information on random seeds, hardware, training time, and software licensing.  \n4. **Synthetic label diversity** – All label ensembles are derived from TotalSegmentator masks, with limited assessment of how this restricts coverage of pathological or atypical anatomies.  \n5. **Feature invariance assessment** – The claim of modality‑invariant representations is supported visually but lacks quantitative validation metrics.  \n6. **Contrastive temperature** – The analysis of the temperature parameter τ is restricted to a few values; broader exploration would clarify sensitivity.  \n7. **Feature scaling** – The fixed scaling of 16‑channel registration features is not justified or tested for sensitivity.  \n8. **Augmentation ablations** – Only grouped augmentation ablations are shown; the contribution of individual augmentations remains unclear.  \n9. **Fine‑tuning protocol** – Few‑shot segmentation experiments use a fixed training schedule without testing alternatives such as linear probing or varying labeled volumes.  \n10. **Negative result** – The performance drop on neurite‑OASIS is reported but not explained, leaving unclear why pretraining fails in this setting.  \n11. **Baseline fairness** – Multitask registration comparisons exclude several relevant foundation models, limiting comparative validity.  \n12. **Code and data availability** – Although a project URL is given, the accessibility of scripts, pretrained weights, and license details is uncertain.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify the influence of missing anatomical subclasses in the label ensembles.  \n- Provide quantitative measures for feature stability (e.g., variance or mutual information).  \n- Specify randomization control and computational setup for reproducibility.  \n- Include sensitivity analyses for temperature τ and channel scaling in registration.  \n- Clarify whether the repository ensures complete access to code and datasets.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the study presents a potentially impactful contribution by establishing a synthetic data–driven contrastive pretraining framework for volumetric biomedical learning. The experiments are comprehensive and methodologically sound, demonstrating notable gains across several benchmarks. Nonetheless, the work would benefit from additional statistical testing, expanded baseline comparisons, and clearer documentation of synthetic data generation and code availability to ensure transparency and reproducibility.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The approach is promising and innovative but requires further experimental validation, reproducibility clarification, and additional comparative analysis before acceptance.",

    "abstract": "With the rise of medical foundation models and the growing availability of imaging data, scalable pretraining techniques offer a promising way to identify imaging biomarkers predictive of future disease risk. While current self-supervised methods for 3D medical imaging models capture local structural features like organ morphology, they fail to link pixel biomarkers with long-term health outcomes due to a missing context problem. Current approaches lack the temporal context necessary to identify biomarkers correlated with disease progression, as they rely on supervision derived only from images and concurrent text descriptions. To address this, we introduce time-to-event pretraining, a pretraining framework for 3D medical imaging models that leverages large-scale temporal supervision from paired, longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Using a dataset of 18,945 CT scans (4.2 million 2D images) and time-to-event distributions across thousands of EHR-derived tasks, our method improves outcome prediction, achieving an average AUROC increase of 23.7% and a 29.4% gain in Harrell’s C-index across 8 benchmark tasks. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing diagnostic classification performance. This study lays the foundation for integrating longitudinal EHR and 3D imaging data to advance clinical risk prediction.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\n*Edit: Score increased from 6 to 8 during discussion period.*\n\nThis paper presents a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for 3D medical imaging data that leverages electronic health records (EHR) to provide extra sources of supervision via time-to-event modeling. The proposed method, future-guided pretraining, performs time-to-event (TTE) survival modeling of various medical events in the longitudinal EHR associated with each 3D scan. The authors show that future-guided pretraining consistently improves downstream TTE modeling and prognostic classification tasks – also improving data efficiency – without degrading standard diagnostic classification performance.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The presentation quality is very high. Care has been taken to logically organize the paper, clearly articulate key points, and straightforwardly present results with concise figures and tables.\n- The core idea is creative, making use of the wealth of longitudinal EHR data associated with each 3D volume for pretraining.\n- Discussion or related work and background is particularly strong.\n- Experiments are sufficiently thorough and easy to interpret – results are convincing.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- The actual description of the TTE pretraining approach is brief (lines 184-191) and somewhat unclear. I would advise the authors to flesh out this section. See specific questions below.\n- A description or list of the 8,192 EHR pretraining tasks is never provided. I’m aware there may not be a convenient place to list this many items, but a general description of categories of events or a few illustrative examples would be helpful. Without this information, it’s impossible to assess whether, e.g., one the TTE pretraining tasks is *also* used as a downstream TTE modeling task. In this case, there may be concerns of “label leakage”.\n\nI’m happy to increase my score once these issues are addressed – this is an otherwise strong submission.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What exactly does it mean that Steinberg et al.’s method was used to “[sample tasks to maximize entropy given the frequency distribution of medical codes populating the DAG”? I feel that a basic plain-language description of the motivation for this procedure is needed first: why is this method being applied at all? Are there way more than 8k events and the goal is to settle on a subset of 8k “meaningful”/common ones for pretraining? I don’t understand the motivation.\n- Unless I am misunderstanding, this is the only description of the TTE pretraining procedure and labels used: “We define our TTE task labels by predicting the time until the next occurrence of a medical code.” The previous Section 3 described deep survival modeling in the abstract, so I expected Section 4 to more concretely describe how TTE pretraining works. Is this a “competing risks” approach, where multiple events are being modeled simultaneously (in “multi-label” fashion)?\n- What are the 8,192 EHR tasks/events? I’m aware it would be cumbersome or impossible to list and define them all, but any reasonable attempt to convey information about them would be useful. What kinds of “events” are they? What are some examples?\n- Related to the above point, are the downstream labels *also* present in the set of TTE pretraining tasks? If so, isn’t there concern of “label leakage”, where the model has been pretrained on label information present in the downstream training dataset? Please clarify this.\n\n**Minor comments/questions:**\n- Line 13: Maybe “build” instead of “capture” since you use this word in the next sentence.\n- In-text citation style seems off – should be parenthetical (\\pcite{}) in most cases when used at end of sentence/clause: “Sox et al. (2024)” -> “(Sox et al., 2024)”\n- Change “e.g.” -> “e.g.,” throughout\n- Would include more recent references [1,2] when discussing deep prognosis models on longitudinal medical imaging (first paragraph of Section 2)\n- “i.e. 8192” -> “i.e., 8.192”\n- “Our approach improves training data efficiency, increasing training labels by an average of 3x over labels assigned to patients based on their current EHR visit.” This is a bit unusual to highlight as a main contribution – I don’t think readers will understand what “increasing training labels” means without having read the entire paper (nor why this impact data efficiency). Perhaps clarify language here to indicate that your approach provides 3x as many sources of supervision during SSL + that this is what provides data efficiency benefits.\n- “Pretraining task labels as assigned per-CT scan and vary in density based on pretraining approach, see Figure 2.” Perhaps “as assigned” is meant to be “are assigned”? Also change “, see Figure 2” -> “(Figure 2)”.\n- Be consistent with “c-statistic” vs. “C-statistic”\n\n**References**\n[1] Holste, Gregory, et al. \"Harnessing the power of longitudinal medical imaging for eye disease prognosis using Transformer-based sequence modeling.\" NPJ Digital Medicine 7.1 (2024): 216.\n[2] Sriram, Anuroop, et al. \"Covid-19 prognosis via self-supervised representation learning and multi-image prediction.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.04909 (2021).\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript presents a *methodological innovation* in medical image modeling — a new *time‑to‑event (TTE) pretraining* framework for 3‑D imaging encoders that integrates longitudinal EHR‑derived temporal supervision. This lies firmly within the scope of IEEE *Transactions on Medical Imaging*, which emphasizes new imaging algorithms, reconstruction and modeling techniques, and machine‑learning methods grounded in imaging science rather than purely clinical application.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe study introduces the first large‑scale *TTE pretraining paradigm for 3‑D medical images*. It bridges survival analysis and large‑scale representation learning, moving beyond per‑exam or static self‑supervised schemes. The idea of using TTE distributions as supervision signals in pretraining is distinctly new for imaging foundation models. The contribution level is high, provided the implementation and validation are rigorous.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe technical formulation of the piecewise exponential neural network and the PEANN‑based loss is mathematically consistent; the authors also present ablations, metrics (AUROC, Harrell’s C‑index, Brier score), and comparisons to strong baselines. However, parts of the methodology—such as details of task sampling from 8,192 events, data harmonization, and how censorship handling interacts with multitask pretraining—should be explained more precisely. Experiments are extensive, use publicly available datasets (INSPECT and RSPECT), and include statistical confidence intervals. Overall rigor is good, though the theoretical justification for why TTE pretraining improves representation quality could be expanded.\n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe paper is clearly structured with detailed tables, appendices, and well‑commented figures. The terminology (“missing context problem,” “piecewise exponential neural network”) is appropriate for the field. Minor language polishing could improve readability; currently, the manuscript is densely written.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \n✅ The authors use publicly released, de‑identified datasets, describe compliance with HIPAA requirements, and provide open code and checkpoints. Ethical considerations and subgroup bias analyses are included, aligning with reproducibility and fairness expectations of *TMI*.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report\n\n#### 1. Summary\nThis paper proposes **time‑to‑event (TTE) pretraining** for 3‑D medical image foundation models. The method links each imaging study to long‑term EHR outcomes to learn representations predictive not only of current disease but of *future events*. Using a **piecewise exponential neural network (PEANN)** as the survival objective, 8,192 EHR‑derived TTE tasks are generated across ~19k CT exams. The pretrained encoder is evaluated by linear and Cox‐based probes on eight outcome‑prediction tasks and eight diagnostic tasks. Results show mean gains of roughly 20–30 % in AUROC and Harrell’s C‑index on prognostic prediction without loss of diagnostic accuracy.\n\n#### 2. Strengths\n- **Methodological novelty**: introduces TTE modeling as a large‑scale pretraining signal for 3‑D imaging.  \n- **Technical soundness**: clearly formulated PEANN loss and comprehensive experimental design.  \n- **Empirically broad**: multi‑architecture validation (SwinUNETR, DenseNet, ResNet), multiple performance metrics, and subgroup fairness checks.  \n- **Reproducibility and openness**: code, model weights, and dataset identifiers are supplied.  \n- **Clinical relevance**: connects imaging features to long‑term outcomes, addressing a key gap in prognostic imaging.\n\n#### 3. Weaknesses\n- Limited theoretical explanation of *why* survival‑based supervision yields more transferable representations beyond increased label density.  \n- EHR–imaging alignment and task‑sampling procedure depend on several heuristic design choices; robustness to those choices is not explored.  \n- Evaluation restricted to chest CT; generalizability to other modalities, body regions, and tasks remains untested.  \n- Compute cost is extremely high (hundreds of GPU‑hours), potentially limiting reproducibility for typical labs.  \n- Writing is occasionally repetitive; the message could be clearer with condensation of tables/figures.\n\n#### 4. Major Comments\n1. **Clarify the pretraining objective integration:** Expand Section 4 describing how multiple TTE tasks are optimized jointly — whether losses are summed, weighted, or sampled per batch. Include sensitivity analysis for the number of time bins and task selection method (entropy‑ranked vertex cover).  \n2. **Provide deeper theoretical motivation:** Connect the survival likelihood to representation learning theory—why should time‑dependent hazard supervision improve prognostic encoding?  \n3. **Generalization assessment:** Consider at least one non‑thoracic dataset or 2‑D modality to test transferability beyond chest CT.  \n4. **Compute and scalability discussion:** Include a quantitative comparison of performance versus compute cost or label density to highlight efficiency gains.  \n5. **Bias and censoring:** Elaborate on how competing risks and varying censoring distributions affect training stability; include discussion of possible biases introduced by EHR‑derived event times.\n\n#### 5. Minor Comments\n- Proofread for minor grammar inconsistencies (“pretrianing,” “inspsect”).  \n- Some figures (e.g., Grad‑CAM montages, Appendix Q) could be resized or compressed; the main text may summarize key examples instead of showing all.  \n- Consolidate identical numeric results presented across tables/appendices; highlight essential findings in the primary text.  \n- Add consistent notation for survival time variables; some equations reuse symbols (T, ˜T) inconsistently.  \n- Cite recent TMI relevant works on self‑supervised risk prediction if available.\n\n#### 6. Overall Recommendation  \n**Major Revision** – The study is promising and methodologically innovative, clearly within TMI’s scope, but requires stronger justification, clearer methodological exposition, and possibly an additional demonstration of generalizability. With these revisions, it could reach TMI’s publication standard.\n\n#### 7. Confidence Level  \n**4/5** – High confidence in assessment; the reviewer has expertise in medical imaging machine learning and time‑to‑event modeling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Decision:**  \nThe paper offers *substantive methodological advancement* with strong empirical evidence and reproducibility. Addressing the above major comments—particularly on theoretical motivation, cross‑modality robustness, and detailed implementation clarity—would likely make it a strong candidate for publication in *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces time-to-event (TTE) pretraining for 3D medical imaging models to address the \"missing context problem\" in current self-supervised learning approaches. The authors argue that existing methods fail to learn prognostic biomarkers because they rely only on imaging data and concurrent text descriptions, lacking temporal information about disease progression. Their method leverages longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) to create 8,192 TTE pretraining tasks using piecewise exponential neural networks (PEANN). The approach is evaluated on 18,945 CT scans from the INSPECT dataset and tested on three architectures (SwinUNETR, DenseNet-121, ResNet-152). Results show average improvements of 23.7% in AUROC and 29.4% in Harrell's C-index across 8 benchmark tasks for prognostic prediction, while maintaining diagnostic classification performance on the RSPECT dataset.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and notation clarity issues**\n  - Equation 1 uses inconsistent notation where the survival function Si(t) depends on both patient i and time piece p, but the relationship between image-specific representations Mip and the hazard calculation is unclear (Section 3, Equation 1)\n  - The derivation of the loss function references Appendix M but the main text lacks sufficient mathematical detail to verify the PEANN implementation independently (Section 3, page 5)\n  - The piecewise exponential model assumes constant hazard rates within intervals, but the paper doesn't adequately justify this assumption for medical events or discuss potential violations (Section 3, Equation 1)\n\n• **Limited experimental scope and generalizability concerns**\n  - The evaluation is restricted to chest CT scans from a single institution (INSPECT dataset), limiting generalizability across different imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and healthcare systems (Table 1, Section 5)\n  - Only three architectures are tested, with two (DenseNet, ResNet) using 2D weight inflation rather than native 3D pretraining, potentially confounding the comparison (Section 5, page 7)\n  - The baseline comparisons lack strong SSL methods specifically designed for 3D medical imaging, making it difficult to assess the true benefit of TTE supervision over state-of-the-art alternatives (Section 5, page 7)\n\n• **Methodological limitations in task selection and evaluation design**\n  - The entropy-ranked vertex cover approach for selecting 8,192 pretraining tasks from 4.3 million candidates lacks sufficient detail and validation of task relevance (Section 4, page 5)\n  - The frozen encoder evaluation strategy may not reflect real-world deployment scenarios where full fine-tuning is often preferred (Section 4, page 6)\n  - Statistical significance testing uses bootstrap confidence intervals but doesn't adequately address multiple comparisons across numerous tasks and metrics (Section 5, Tables 2-4)\n\n• **Insufficient analysis of temporal assumptions and competing risks**\n  - The method treats patient death as the only competing risk and censors at death, but medical events often have complex competing risk structures that could bias results (Section 4, page 6)\n  - The choice of uniform time bins for the piecewise exponential model lacks justification and sensitivity analysis across different temporal discretizations (Section 5, page 6)\n  - No evidence found in the manuscript for handling time-varying covariates or validating the proportional hazards assumption underlying the evaluation metrics\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Provide complete mathematical derivations in the main text rather than relegating them to appendices, ensuring all notation is clearly defined and consistently used throughout\n  - Include formal justification for the piecewise exponential assumption with empirical validation on the medical event data\n  - Add sensitivity analyses examining how different choices of time intervals and hazard rate assumptions affect model performance\n\n• **Expand experimental validation scope**\n  - Evaluate the approach on multiple datasets from different institutions and imaging modalities to demonstrate broader applicability beyond chest CT scans\n  - Include comparisons with recent 3D SSL methods specifically designed for medical imaging rather than relying primarily on 2D weight inflation baselines\n  - Conduct experiments using native 3D pretrained models for all architectures to ensure fair comparisons\n\n• **Strengthen methodological foundations and evaluation protocols**\n  - Provide detailed algorithmic descriptions and validation studies for the entropy-ranked vertex cover task selection method, including ablation studies on different numbers of selected tasks\n  - Compare frozen encoder results with full fine-tuning approaches to better understand the trade-offs and practical deployment considerations\n  - Implement proper multiple comparison corrections and provide more comprehensive statistical analysis addressing the numerous hypothesis tests conducted\n\n• **Address temporal modeling limitations comprehensively**\n  - Extend the competing risk analysis beyond death censoring to include other relevant competing events and validate these assumptions empirically\n  - Conduct systematic sensitivity analyses across different temporal discretization schemes and validate the impact on downstream performance\n  - Incorporate methods for handling time-varying covariates and provide empirical validation of key survival analysis assumptions using the available longitudinal data",

The method attaches a piecewise exponential neural network (PEANN) survival head to a 3D CT encoder and continues pretraining on 8,192 EHR-selected tasks, then evaluates frozen encoders with lightweight survival or classification heads. Using the public INSPECT dataset (18,945 CTs with ~5-year follow-up) and external RSPECT, the authors report substantial gains on prognostic tasks (e.g., AUROC and Harrell’s C-index) without degrading diagnostic classification performance.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntroduces a scalable, EHR-driven TTE pretraining paradigm for 3D imaging, addressing the “missing context” problem by leveraging longitudinal outcome supervision rather than contemporaneous labels only.Sensible survival modeling choice (piecewise-exponential hazard) that is stable, censoring-aware, and computationally feasible at scale; pragmatic adaptation with a CoxPH (DeepSurv) probe for downstream TTE.Task selection via an ontology-aware, entropy-ranked vertex cover leverages the structure of medical code graphs to curate a large, diverse set of TTE tasks.Demonstrates that temporal outcome supervision can be used as a pretraining signal to embed prognostic information into 3D encoders.\n- Experimental rigor and validationUses only public datasets (INSPECT, RSPECT) with clear splits; includes multiple 3D backbones (SwinUNETR, ResNet-152, DenseNet-121) and continued-pretraining baselines (MTL, per-visit labels).Reports bootstrap CIs, significance tests, and multiple metrics (AUROC, Harrell’s C-index; mentions IBS and time-dependent C-statistics in appendices).Provides an informative visit-vs-TTE ablation with the same 8,192 tasks to isolate the value of future temporal supervision.\n- Clarity of presentationThe problem framing and motivation (missing temporal context in standard SSL) are clear and clinically relevant, with helpful schematics.The pipeline overview (task creation, PEANN pretraining, frozen adaptation) is understandable and aligns with the stated hypotheses.\n- Significance of contributionsPrognostic modeling from imaging is a high-impact, underexplored setting; integrating EHR-derived TTE supervision into 3D encoders advances the field.The reported gains on risk prediction with no degradation on diagnostic tasks suggests practical utility for clinical decision support.\n\n- Introduces a scalable, EHR-driven TTE pretraining paradigm for 3D imaging, addressing the “missing context” problem by leveraging longitudinal outcome supervision rather than contemporaneous labels only.\n- Sensible survival modeling choice (piecewise-exponential hazard) that is stable, censoring-aware, and computationally feasible at scale; pragmatic adaptation with a CoxPH (DeepSurv) probe for downstream TTE.\n- Task selection via an ontology-aware, entropy-ranked vertex cover leverages the structure of medical code graphs to curate a large, diverse set of TTE tasks.\n- Demonstrates that temporal outcome supervision can be used as a pretraining signal to embed prognostic information into 3D encoders.\n\n- Uses only public datasets (INSPECT, RSPECT) with clear splits; includes multiple 3D backbones (SwinUNETR, ResNet-152, DenseNet-121) and continued-pretraining baselines (MTL, per-visit labels).\n- Reports bootstrap CIs, significance tests, and multiple metrics (AUROC, Harrell’s C-index; mentions IBS and time-dependent C-statistics in appendices).\n- Provides an informative visit-vs-TTE ablation with the same 8,192 tasks to isolate the value of future temporal supervision.\n\n- The problem framing and motivation (missing temporal context in standard SSL) are clear and clinically relevant, with helpful schematics.\n- The pipeline overview (task creation, PEANN pretraining, frozen adaptation) is understandable and aligns with the stated hypotheses.\n\n- Prognostic modeling from imaging is a high-impact, underexplored setting; integrating EHR-derived TTE supervision into 3D encoders advances the field.\n- The reported gains on risk prediction with no degradation on diagnostic tasks suggests practical utility for clinical decision support.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe survival head is piecewise-constant hazard with a fixed number of uniform time bins (P=8). This may be suboptimal for heterogeneous hazards; no ablations on bin count/placement (e.g., quantile/log time) are presented.Competing risks are simplified to “death only,” which is often inadequate for multi-outcome EHR settings; no cause-specific or multi-state modeling during pretraining.The mismatch between a PEANN head during pretraining and a CoxPH head during adaptation could lead to inconsistencies; limited discussion on why PEANN wasn’t also used for adaptation.Each task is modeled independently; any shared structure across outcomes (e.g., via multi-task survival heads) is not exploited.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesExternal generalization is limited to a single diagnostic dataset (RSPECT) and only CT modality; no multi-institution evaluation for prognostic TTE transfer.Overlap between pretraining tasks and evaluation tasks is likely (e.g., PH). While the split prevents leakage across sets, it would be more convincing to show results when excluding evaluation-identical codes from pretraining.No ablation on the number of TTE tasks, selection heuristic variants, or label-density controls (e.g., holding label counts constant across visit vs TTE).Multiple comparisons are performed, but it is unclear whether corrections (e.g., FDR) were applied; some tables include repeated placeholder-like values (e.g., 0.505) that merit clarification.Calibration claims (IBS improvements) are relegated to the appendix; inclusion of main-text calibration plots/tables would strengthen the argument.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSeveral technical details are under-specified: precise definition of time origin, treatment of left truncation, interval construction, and handling of irregular follow-up.The statement “we apply censorship at patient death” is ambiguous; for non-mortality tasks death is a competing risk, not simple censoring—please clarify the exact handling.Code links in the text appear as placeholders; explicit, functioning links are crucial for reproducibility.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited discussion of recent progression-aware SSL and survival heads for neural models beyond Cox/PE (e.g., DeepHit, discrete-time/PLH/PLD survival heads; survival modeling with piecewise-linear hazards).Recent imaging-time-aware SSL approaches (e.g., TE-SSL for MRI, 3DTINC for OCT) are not positioned relative to this work; a brief comparison would strengthen context.Survival models that couple interpretability and deep components (DeepPAMM/DeepPAM) are relevant and could inform head design and calibration.\n\n- The survival head is piecewise-constant hazard with a fixed number of uniform time bins (P=8).

However, a stronger label-density ablation is needed to rule out that gains are solely from having more labels (e.g., subsample TTE labels to match per-visit density).Provide an ablation on (i) number of TTE tasks (e.g., 2k/4k/8k), (ii) bin count/placement, and (iii) excluding any evaluation-identical codes from the pretraining set to assess transfer to unseen outcomes.Prognostic gains are compelling, but calibration is central for clinical use; move IBS results into the main text and add reliability diagrams and time-dependent calibration error (e.g., Nam–D’Agostino).Consider adding end-to-end fine-tuning on downstream TTE tasks to show that the pretrained representation continues to help when capacity is allowed to adapt, and report sample-efficiency curves.Statistical testing across many settings should include multiple-comparison correction. Clarify the seemingly repeated values (e.g., many 0.505s) and ensure reported CIs reflect non-parametric bootstrap variability per task.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Relative to TE-SSL (time/event-aware SSL on MRI) and 3DTINC (time-aware SSL on OCT), this work differs by using EHR-derived TTE supervision rather than purely imaging-based temporal pairing. A short discussion of these lines would position your contributions more clearly and suggest hybrid objectives (contrastive + TTE) for future work.Survival head alternatives (e.g., DeepHit, piecewise-linear hazard/density heads) could be referenced as potential replacements for PEANN that may improve calibration and flexibility.DeepPAMM/DeepPAM highlight semi-structured survival models that combine interpretable time terms with deep features; such designs could be relevant for adding smooth baseline/time-varying effects or for competing risks.MOTOR (structured EHR TTE foundation model) is properly cited; consider discussing how its low-rank task parameterization or task-selection safeguards against leakage could translate to imaging–EHR pretraining.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe work addresses a meaningful clinical gap: prognostic imaging models often lack the temporal supervision needed to discover risk-related imaging biomarkers. Demonstrating large gains on C-index while preserving diagnostic performance is impactful.Ethical and equity considerations deserve more emphasis. EHR-derived supervision can encode access, utilization, and coding biases (e.g., disparate censoring, undertesting). Please report subgroup analyses (by age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance) and fairness metrics, and discuss mitigation strategies.Releasing reproducible code/models on public data is valuable to the community; ensure links function and include scripts for EHR processing, task selection, and label construction to enable independent verification.\n\n- The PEANN objective is appropriate for large-scale TTE with censoring; using a hazard-based piecewise exponential model avoids normalization pitfalls and provides a proper survival function.\n- Uniform binning and a fixed P=8 may limit fidelity for tasks with early/late hazard spikes; consider data-driven binning (quantiles/log-time) or piecewise-linear hazards to improve flexibility and calibration.\n- Treating death as the only competing risk for all tasks can bias estimates for outcomes where other competing events exist; consider cause-specific or Fine–Gray modeling in pretraining if computationally feasible.\n- Modeling tasks independently overlooks cross-outcome correlations; multi-task survival heads or shared low-rank task parameterizations could yield further gains.\n\n- The continued-pretraining baselines are well-chosen, especially base/visit which isolates the effect of future temporal supervision.

Can you report results excluding any overlapping codes from pretraining?\n- Why choose uniform time bins and P=8 for PEANN? Did you try alternative bin counts or placements (e.g., quantile/log spacing) and piecewise-linear hazards? Please provide ablations and any effects on calibration (IBS).\n- How exactly are label counts in Figure 3 computed (per code, per interval, or per code-interval pair)? Could differences in label-density alone explain some of the gains versus per-visit? Can you include a control where TTE labels are subsampled to match per-visit density?\n- For non-mortality outcomes, how are death and other competing events handled? The phrase “censorship at patient death” suggests treating death as censoring, but clinically it is a competing risk. Please clarify and justify this choice.\n- What safeguards prevent information leakage from EHR-derived labels into the test split (e.g., overlapping longitudinal windows across patients, transfers across encounters)? Please detail the split strategy relative to patient timelines.\n- Could you share more details on the entropy-ranked vertex cover selection: inputs, hyperparameters, and any sensitivity to the task budget? How stable are the selected 8,192 tasks across random seeds?\n- Why did CoxPH (DeepSurv) outperform PEANN as a downstream probe, given PEANN was used in pretraining? Do you hypothesize a mismatch in objectives or implementation details?\n- Can you report main-text calibration results (IBS, calibration plots) and time-dependent C statistics to substantiate the claim of improved calibration?\n- Did you evaluate end-to-end fine-tuning of the encoder on downstream tasks, and few-shot regimes to test label efficiency? If so, how do results compare to frozen-probe evaluations?\n- What are the exact preprocessing steps for CT volumes (resampling, windowing, cropping) and how sensitive are results to these choices?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper addresses an important and timely problem: enabling 3D imaging encoders to learn prognostic biomarkers by injecting longitudinal temporal supervision from EHRs via a time-to-event objective. The approach is well-motivated, technically sound in broad strokes, and the empirical results on public datasets are encouraging, with sizable gains on prognostic metrics and no observed harm to diagnostic classification. The work is likely to be valuable to the community and pushes the field toward clinically useful imaging foundation models. To reach top-tier standards, I recommend strengthening the methodological clarity (binning, competing risks), adding key ablations (task overlap, label-density controls, task number/binning), reporting calibration in the main text, and broadening context against recent time-aware SSL and survival-head alternatives. With these additions and polished reproducibility (working code links), the contribution would be compelling for publication.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces a time-to-event (TTE) pretraining strategy for 3D medical imaging encoders that leverages longitudinal supervision from electronic health records (EHRs) to learn prognostic representations. A piecewise exponential neural network (PEANN) survival head is attached to a 3D CT encoder and pretrained on 8,192 automatically selected TTE tasks derived from EHR data. The pretrained encoders are evaluated—without further fine-tuning—on public CT datasets (INSPECT and RSPECT), showing improved prognostic performance (AUROC, Harrell’s C-index) without loss in diagnostic accuracy. The paper is clearly written, well-motivated, and presents a rigorous empirical evaluation using fully public data, suggesting meaningful advances in prognostic imaging representation learning.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Modeling Limitations:** The PEANN uses a fixed number (P=8) of uniform time bins, potentially limiting flexibility for heterogeneous hazards. No ablation on bin number or placement (e.g., quantile/log-time) is provided.  \n2. **Handling of Competing Risks:** Pretraining simplifies competing risks to a single “death” event, which is insufficient for multi-outcome EHR settings. Cause-specific or multi-state modeling should be discussed.  \n3. **Objective Mismatch:** The shift from PEANN during pretraining to CoxPH (DeepSurv) during adaptation could cause inconsistencies; rationale for not using PEANN downstream is limited.  \n4. **Task Independence:** Each TTE task is modeled separately; shared-structure modeling via multi-task or low-rank survival heads could be advantageous.  \n5. **Experimental Scope:** Generalization is evaluated only on one external CT dataset. No ablation on task number, heuristic variants, or label-density control is shown; possible overlap between pretraining and evaluation tasks should be ruled out.  \n6. **Statistical and Calibration Reporting:** Multiple comparisons lack correction details (e.g., FDR). Calibration evidence is relegated to the appendix; main-text calibration plots and reliability diagrams are strongly recommended.  \n7. **Clarity and Reproducibility:** Definitions of time origin, left truncation handling, and death censorship are unclear. Code references are placeholders and must be functional for reproducibility.  \n8. **Contextualization:** The discussion omits related temporal SSL and survival-head methods (e.g., TE-SSL, 3DTINC, DeepHit, DeepPAMM). A concise positioning relative to these would improve context.  \n9. **Fairness Considerations:** EHR-derived supervision may encode demographic or access biases; subgroup and fairness analyses should be added to assess equity impacts.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify label count computation and pretraining task selection stability.  \n- Correct repeated placeholder numeric values (e.g., 0.505) in tables.  \n- Explicitly describe CT preprocessing steps and parameter sensitivities.  \n- Consider including end-to-end fine-tuning and few-shot experiments to verify representation utility.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, this paper presents a technically interesting and well-motivated approach that bridges imaging and prognosis through TTE supervision. Its strengths lie in the innovative formulation, use of public datasets, and careful evaluation design. However, areas needing improvement include survival head flexibility, handling of competing risks, ablation completeness, calibration reporting, and clarity in methodological details. Addressing these issues would considerably enhance confidence in the contribution’s rigor and generalizability.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**",

        "text": "# Review Report for \"TIME-TO-EVENT PRETRAINING FOR 3D MEDICAL IMAGING\"\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThe paper addresses a critical limitation in current medical imaging foundation models: the inability to capture temporal disease progression patterns needed for identifying prognostic pixel biomarkers. The authors identify what they term a \"missing context problem\" where existing self-supervised learning methods focus on local structural features but fail to link pixel information with future health outcomes due to the absence of longitudinal temporal context. To solve this, they propose a novel time-to-event (TTE) pretraining framework that leverages longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) to provide rich temporal supervision signals. Using 18,945 chest CT scans (4.2 million 2D images) linked to EHR data with 225 million clinical events, the authors create 8,192 TTE pretraining tasks that capture when clinical events occur. Their approach demonstrates substantial improvements in prognostic prediction, achieving an average AUROC increase of 23.7% and a 29.4% gain in Harrell's C-index across 8 benchmark tasks, while maintaining diagnostic classification performance. The method also increases label density by 3x compared to prior approaches, enhancing data efficiency without requiring additional annotation effort.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n**Major Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses a genuine and significant gap in medical imaging foundation models by incorporating temporal context from longitudinal EHR data, which is essential for clinical prognosis but largely overlooked in current approaches\n- The methodology is well-designed and grounded in established survival analysis techniques, with a thoughtful selection of 8,192 diverse pretraining tasks from medical ontologies\n- The comprehensive evaluation across three architectures (SwinUNETR, DenseNet, ResNet) and multiple metrics (AUROC, Harrell's C-index, Integrated Brier Score) provides compelling evidence of the approach's effectiveness\n- The authors have made significant contributions to reproducibility by releasing code and model checkpoints, and using public datasets that others can replicate\n\n**Major Limitations:**\n- The paper lacks comparison to more recent medical vision foundation models beyond Merlin (e.g., Med3D, MedCLIP), which limits the understanding of how TTE pretraining compares to state-of-the-art approaches\n- The computational requirements (80GB GPUs for SwinUNETR) may limit accessibility for many researchers, particularly in resource-constrained settings\n- The study is limited to chest CT scans only, with no validation on other imaging modalities or body regions, raising questions about generalizability\n- The ethical considerations regarding potential biases in the EHR data and how they might affect model performance across subgroups could be more thoroughly addressed\n\n**Minor Strengths:**\n- The GradCAM visualizations effectively demonstrate improved biomarker localization in the TTE-pretrained models compared to baselines\n- The detailed ablation studies (including subgroup performance analysis) strengthen the validity of the claims and show consistent improvements across demographic categories\n- The thorough statistical analysis with confidence intervals and significance testing adds substantial credibility to the findings\n\n**Minor Limitations:**\n- Some figures could be better labeled (e.g., Figure 3 lacks y-axis labels, making interpretation difficult)\n- The description of medical code selection criteria could be more detailed to help readers understand the representativeness of the 8,192 tasks\n- The explanation of why piecewise exponential neural networks were chosen over other survival models could be expanded for readers less familiar with survival analysis\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation Against TMI Criteria\n\n**Significance:** This work addresses an important gap in medical imaging AI - the inability of current foundation models to capture temporal disease progression despite its clinical importance. By linking imaging biomarkers to future outcomes, this approach could significantly advance clinical risk prediction tools. The demonstrated 23.7% AUROC improvement across diverse prognostic tasks represents a meaningful advance with potential clinical impact, particularly for early intervention in disease progression.\n\n**Innovation:** The key innovation is the novel integration of time-to-event analysis with 3D medical image pretraining at scale, which has not been previously explored in this manner. The method effectively converts longitudinal EHR data into rich temporal supervision signals, creating 8,192 pretraining tasks that capture complex temporal patterns. The approach also innovatively handles right-censoring, a common challenge in clinical data that is often overlooked in imaging studies.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is exceptionally thorough across multiple architectures, metrics, and task types (prognostic classification, time-to-event prediction, diagnostic classification). The authors provide extensive statistical analysis with confidence intervals and significance testing, and the subgroup analysis demonstrates consistent improvements across demographic categories. The comparison against multiple baselines (Random Init., Base, MT, Visit) provides clear evidence of the specific contribution of TTE pretraining.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides excellent reproducibility with public datasets (INSPECT, RSPECT), detailed hyperparameters in Appendix F, and release of code and model checkpoints. The authors' commitment to transparency is further demonstrated through comprehensive appendices covering data preprocessing, model architectures, and evaluation metrics. The use of established medical datasets facilitates replication by other researchers.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nI recommend **acceptance with minor revisions**. This paper makes a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging foundation models by addressing a critical limitation in current approaches. The methodology is sound, the evaluation is exceptionally thorough, and the results are compelling across multiple metrics and architectures. While there are minor limitations regarding comparisons to more recent models and scope of validation, these do not undermine the core contribution. The work is well-positioned for TMI as it addresses a key challenge in medical imaging AI with practical clinical implications. The authors should address the minor limitations noted above, particularly improving figure labeling and providing more detail about medical code selection, but the core contributions and findings are strong enough for acceptance with these relatively straightforward revisions. The paper's emphasis on reproducibility and open science further strengthens its suitability for TMI.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the “missing context problem” in 3‑D medical imaging, namely that most self‑supervised approaches ignore the longitudinal information required to learn prognostic pixel‑level biomarkers. Using a publicly available cohort of 18,945 chest CT scans (≈4.2 million 2‑D slices) linked to electronic health records that contain 225 million clinical events and a median follow‑up of five years, the authors introduce a pre‑training strategy termed time‑to‑event (TTE) pre‑training. In this framework, EHR codes are transformed into thousands of survival tasks and a 3‑D vision encoder is trained with a piecewise‑exponential neural network loss that naturally handles right‑censoring. After continued pre‑training, the frozen encoder is fine‑tuned with classification or survival heads for downstream tasks. The reported results show average gains of 23.7 % in AUROC and 29.4 % in Harrell’s C‑index across eight benchmark outcome‑prediction tasks, while preserving performance on diagnostic classification. The primary contribution is the first large‑scale evaluation of survival‑based pre‑training for 3‑D medical imaging models.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n*Significance*: Integrating long‑term EHR outcomes into image pre‑training directly addresses a key limitation of current prognosis‑oriented AI and could enable discovery of pixel‑level risk biomarkers.  \n\n*Innovation*: The combination of (i) massive multi‑task TTE supervision through a piecewise‑exponential approach, (ii) ontology‑aware conditional‑entropy task selection, and (iii) continued pre‑training of a 3‑D encoder is novel relative to existing self‑supervised or contrastive methods.  \n\n*Evaluation*: Experiments are conducted on two public datasets (INSPECT, RSPECT) and eight downstream TTE tasks, with results reported as AUROC, C‑index, and Integrated Brier Score (Figures 6–8, Tables 2‑5). However, the description of baseline configurations, statistical significance testing, and external validation lacks sufficient detail.  \n\n*Reproducibility*: The authors provide code and model checkpoints and refer to preprocessing details in Appendix A. Nonetheless, crucial training hyper‑parameters, the exact list of tasks, and data‑splitting procedures are not fully disclosed, which hampers full replication.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n* The manuscript does not identify the precise self‑supervised baselines (e.g., MAE, contrastive, Merlin) nor their training regimes and hyper‑parameters. *(Figure 6‑8)*  \n* No confidence intervals or statistical tests (e.g., paired t‑tests) accompany the reported AUROC and C‑index improvements, leaving their significance unclear. *(Section 5)*  \n* The entropy‑based selection of the 8 192 TTE tasks is described only at a high level; the final code list, budget, entropy threshold, and frequency distribution are omitted. *(Figure 2, Appendix B)*  \n* There is no ablation study on the number of piecewise‑exponential bins (currently set to eight), so the effect of this design choice remains unknown. *(Section 4)*  \n* Calibration gains are presented via Integrated Brier Score, but reliability diagrams or other quantitative calibration analyses are absent. *(Figure 8)*  \n* The “external tasks” (eight diagnostic tasks) are mentioned without indicating whether they come from a different institution, modality, or temporal split, which limits assessment of generalisation. *(Figure 6)*  \n* Details on training/validation/test splits, potential patient overlap between INSPECT and RSPECT, and the exact INSPECT version used are not provided, impeding reproducibility. *(Table 1, not shown)*  \n* Computational cost is limited to node specifications; wall‑clock time, GPU‑hours, batch size, and learning‑rate schedule are not reported. *(Section 5)*  \n* Only death is treated as a competing risk; many clinical events have additional competing risks that are ignored, potentially biasing survival estimates. *(Section 5)*  \n* Grad‑CAM visualisations (Figure 20) are offered as interpretability evidence, yet no quantitative analysis of biomarker relevance or validation of the highlighted regions is presented. *(Figure 20)*\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\nMajor Revision – The manuscript currently lacks essential baseline comparisons and statistical analyses; substantial revisions are required before it can be considered for publication.",

    "abstract": "Several medical Multimodal Large Languange Models (MLLMs) have been developed to address tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities, achieving impressive results. \nMost current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence.\nTo mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans.\nTo achieve it, we first formulate \\textbf{Region-Centric tasks} and construct a \\textbf{large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct,} to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a \\textbf{Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA}, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. The codes and model will be made publicly available.",

The proposed dataset contains multiple region-centric evaluation tasks including, region-to-text generation, text-to-region detection, and grounded medical report generation. The paper further proposed a new region-aware multi-modal large language model (MLLM), called, MedRegA, pre-trained with the proposed dataset and regional chain of thought (CoT). The proposed method outperforms multiple existing SOTA medical VQA models on the regional-centric evaluation.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 4\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed new region-centric medical dataset MedRegInstruct addressed the need for fine-grained, region-level, training and evaluation datasets in the medical domain. It is novel to the field and will help the development of the field as provides a more fine-grained training and evaluation annotation. It is proven that the method pre-trained with the new dataset can demonstrate more robust performance in the targeted region-specific tasks and also other related medical tasks. \n2. The paper has provided enough details about the data curation and evaluation, including the process of question-answering pair generation from medical data with region annotation, a prompt for each downstream evaluation, and detailed settings for each task. The author also seems to claim they will release the code and pre-trained model later.\n3. The paper is overall well written with nice figures and a clean presentation. It is easy to follow even if there are many details in it.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. While the proposed dataset is novel and important to the field, the corresponding MedRegA model is not that novel, though I hate to say that, in comparison. The overall model design is basically the same as the base InternVL model and the major change is the training scheme and prompt formulation with the new dataset, which can be extended to other medical VQL models as well. While the author further proposed single-step regional CoT in the paper, it is still relatively straightforward. **Yet**, this is not a major drawback as the performance of this model demonstrates the superiority of training with the proposed dataset.\n2. Similarly, it seems that the baselines used in the evaluation are not all fine-tuned with the proposed dataset, which enables the model to understand regional information. Comparing the model trained on the proposed dataset with baselines that are not trained on this dataset is not very fair, to some extent. It would be interesting to see how well each baseline would improve if they were fine-tuned on the proposed dataset, even if just in a few-shot manner.\n3. Another concern about this paper is the quality of the data. Most of the regional bounding box-text pairs in the dataset were taken from the existing dataset and generated from an automated rule-based system and an LLM. The evaluation of the data quality is missing in this paper, which is very critical as the main purpose is **fine-grained regional evaluation,** where the quality of the bounding box and the correctness of the corresponding text description are very important. It would be better if some sort of data quality check could be done before releasing it to the public.\n\n### Questions\n\nOverall, this is a good paper with solid contributions and it has a significant meaning to the field. Still, the reviewer has a few questions here.\n\n1. How is the English version of the text report/caption generated for the in-house Chinese data? What kind of translation was used here?\n2. According to the “Structure Detection” section on page 5, the structure bounding box in the dataset was generated with a fine-tuned MLLM on the existing Region-Text dataset given the corresponding organ prompt. The reviewer wonders if any kind of evaluation was done on this fine-tuned MLLM, how accurate is the extract bounding box? And why not train a more straightforward detection model for this purpose? Considering that the specific detection model usually performs better than a general MLLM.\n3. Also, as mentioned above, the reviewer wonders how much will the other baseline medical MLLMs improve if they were trained with the proposed dataset. The comparison between InternVL and MedRegA in the paper is not very fair as the InternVL was only trained with natural image-text pairs. The reviewer understands it may take tons of extra time/money to conduct such an evaluation, but it would still be an interesting question to explore.\n4. According to the abstract, the code and model will be released to the public, but the reviewer wonders if the data will be released as well. This is pretty critical as the dataset is the major contribution of the paper. The answer to this question will influence the reviewer's final score for the paper.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- Yes, Privacy, security and safety\n- Yes, Responsible research practice (e.g., human subjects, data release)\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nThe paper proposed a new medical visual question-answering dataset with in-house medical imaging data from a Chinese hospital. Though the author has an ethics statement section in the paper, further ethics evaluation may be needed to ensure there is no critical ethical issue.",

It also presents *MedRegA*, a region-aware multi-modal large language model (MLLM) pre-trained on the proposed dataset with a regional chain of thought approach. The paper reports that MedRegA surpasses several state-of-the-art medical VQA systems on region-centric benchmarks. Overall, the manuscript is clearly written, with thorough methodological details and high-quality figures that support readability.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty of the Model:** While the dataset is genuinely novel and valuable, the MedRegA model itself shows limited architectural innovation compared to the base InternVL model. The primary differences lie in the training scheme and prompt design using the new dataset. The proposed single-step regional chain-of-thought remains conceptually straightforward.  \n2. **Fairness of Baseline Comparisons:** The reported performance comparisons may not be fully equitable, as baseline models were not fine-tuned on the new dataset. Evaluating those baselines after fine-tuning or in a few-shot setting would provide a more balanced comparison.  \n3. **Data Quality and Evaluation:** The dataset integrates bounding box–text pairs derived from existing datasets and automated generation using a rule-based pipeline and an LLM, yet it lacks explicit data quality assessment. Given the paper’s focus on fine-grained regional evaluation, validation of bounding box accuracy and textual correctness is essential before public release.  \n4. **Data Release and Ethics:** The manuscript notes forthcoming release of code and model but does not confirm data release. Clarification on data availability is critical, as the dataset constitutes the core contribution. Furthermore, due diligence regarding privacy and ethical handling of in-house medical data from a Chinese hospital should be ensured.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify how English captions were generated from Chinese medical reports, specifying the translation process.  \n- Provide additional details on the fine-tuned MLLM used for structure detection, including any accuracy evaluation.  \n- Figures and descriptions are generally clear; minor improvements could include explicit labeling of region annotations.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe work substantially contributes a well-structured, region-centric medical VQA dataset and demonstrates its usefulness through strong performance gains. The technical innovation of the accompanying model is incremental, and issues of data quality, fairness in comparisons, and dataset release remain unresolved. Despite these limitations, the paper is methodologically solid, carefully written, and addresses an important gap in medical AI evaluation at the regional level.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**  \nThe paper makes a meaningful contribution through dataset creation, but major concerns regarding baseline fairness, data quality validation, and ethical/data release aspects must be addressed before acceptance.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nIn this work, the authors tackle the current problem in MLLMs (multimodal large language models) of how they don't necessarily \"focus\" on particular regions, but rather take the entire image as context and then have to solve a variety of downstream tasks. To address this problem they offer two main sets of contributions. The first, is the formulation of several region specific tasks, namely region-to-text identification, text-to-region detection, and grounded report generation, which they combine into a dataset called MedRegInstruct. The second is the training strategy and modeling paradigm for a MLLM they propose, which they refer to as MedRegA. MedRegA is a bilingual, as it was trained on both English and Chinese paired datapoints, model that they apply to this larger dataset they prepare in comparison to currently available medical MLLMs.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 4\n\n### Strengths\n\n• The paper really introduces another method of interaction, in the bounding boxes, that can be quite useful as MedRegA is able to reason about specific regions. This is an immensely useful tool for narrowing of problems as opposed to current trained MLLMs have to do.\n\n• The proposed training strategy for learning how to incorporate the bounding boxes is simple and scalable, seems like it could be generally applied to other strategies that want to apply bounding boxes.\n\n• Regional CoT makes a lot of sense intuitively and provides a nice bias for solving region specific problems.\n\n• MedRegA has very strong performance on the chosen set of benchmarks and metrics in comparison to existing state of the art methods.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n• The section of the report grounding dataset is quite confusing as to how its constructed, and how much it relies on the models it uses for automation for providing correct labels/groundtruth. For example, is InternLM perfect at sub-select different parts of the reports? \n\n• The paper claims to work across a broad set of modalities, but when considering the grounding dataset it seems that it only considers, as other MLLMs do, Chest Xrays?\n\n• It's unclear if the comparison to existing baselines are exactly fair as the trained MedRegA has access to more data. In fact, compared to the baseline of InternLM, it should be strictly better because MedRegA is trained with InternLM as an initialization. While it's true that the baselines don't provide a mechanism for highlighting particular regions, they still should be adapted to the new data that the authors are evaluating on.\n\n### Questions\n\n• What was the filtering criterion for reducing SA-Med2D-20M?\n\n• Is there a noticeable performance difference between English and Chinese tasks? Is there paired data that this can be evaluated on? • • • \n\n• Overall, it is unclear from the paper why exactly these two particular languages are used, other than being able to source data for both, rather than just arbitrary languages with medical report data.\n\n• Is the MedRegInstruct dataset planning to be release?\nFor the Region-Text dataset, why is the case that there needs to be this split into half for region-to-text and half for text-to-region? Can't every datapoint server the purpose of being either during training?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

To address the limitation that current MLLMs process entire images without explicit spatial focus, the authors define several localized tasks—region-to-text identification, text-to-region detection, and grounded report generation—collectively forming the **MedRegInstruct** dataset. They further propose a training strategy and modeling paradigm that incorporate bounding-box–based interaction and region-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The manuscript is generally clear and well-presented, with a coherent motivation and well-defined contributions.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Dataset construction and clarity:** The section describing the report grounding dataset is confusing. The process for dataset creation, especially the degree of reliance on automated models for annotation (e.g., InternLM), should be clarified. It is not evident how accurate or reliable these automated annotations are.  \n2. **Scope of modalities:** Although the paper claims to address a broad range of modalities, it appears that the dataset and evaluations are limited primarily to chest X-rays, similar to other medical MLLMs. This discrepancy between claims and actual scope should be addressed.  \n3. **Fairness of comparisons:** The comparison to baseline models may not be entirely fair since MedRegA benefits from additional data and from initialization with InternLM, one of the baselines. This advantage could partially account for the reported performance gains.  \n4. **Language choice and bilingual evaluation:** The motivation for choosing English and Chinese as the two training languages is not clearly justified beyond data availability. It would be helpful to provide evidence of bilingual performance or cross-lingual evaluation.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify the filtering criteria used for reducing the SA‑Med2D‑20M dataset.  \n- Specify whether the MedRegInstruct dataset will be released publicly.  \n- Explain why region‑text pairs are split evenly into region‑to‑text and text‑to‑region samples rather than using a unified setup.  \n- Minor issues of clarity exist in the dataset description section; reorganization could improve readability.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, this work offers a valuable contribution by introducing region-focused interaction mechanisms in medical MLLMs and demonstrating strong benchmark performance.

Scope & Relevance to TMI**\n✅ **Within scope.**  \nThis paper presents a **novel methodological contribution** centered on enhancing medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with *region-centric understanding*. The work integrates spatial localization (region-to-text, text-to-region, grounded report generation) into a large bilingual medical foundation model. The emphasis on interpretability, spatial grounding, structured dataset design, and model formulation positions it squarely within **medical imaging methodology** — particularly image understanding and vision-language modeling. Suitable for IEEE *TMI*.\n\n### **2. Novelty & Contribution Level**\nThe introduction of a **region-aware medical MLLM** and the formulation of **region-centric tasks** (MedRegInstruct dataset, Region-CoT mechanism, and Region-Aligned evaluation scheme) represent a step beyond prior “global” or holistic MLLMs such as Med-Flamingo, RadFM, and MedDr.  \nKey conceptual advances:\n- Structured modeling of image-region-text alignment;\n- Semi-automated curation pipeline integrating bounding-box annotations into bilingual reports;\n- Introduction of interpretable, region-aware grounding in multimodal tasks.  \nThe novelty is incremental relative to major foundation-model efforts but methodologically strong and more interpretable — at or just above *TMI’s novelty threshold.*\n\n### **3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**\n- **Dataset construction:** detailed description, clear provenance (public + institutional data), semi-automatic annotation, and expert validation (≈93% textual accuracy, 72% bounding-box accuracy).  \n- **Modeling:** builds upon InternVL foundation; clearly stated two-stage training (alignment → instruction tuning); includes mathematical formulations of tasks and explicit representation (<box> tags).  \n- **Evaluation:** extensive benchmarking across >15 datasets, region-specific metrics, and comparisons with six baselines.  \n- Potential gaps: limited discussion of generalization to unseen modalities, ablation of dataset quality, and clinical verification of generated regions.\n\n### **4. Clarity and Presentation**\n- Generally **well written and organized**, with coherent narrative from motivation through experiments.\n- Minor grammatical issues, overuse of long sentences, and inconsistent figure captions (e.g., Figure 5/6 labeling).\n- Results tables are comprehensive but dense — clarity could improve via summarizing key metrics.\n\n### **5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**\n- Proper anonymization, IRB-like statement provided, clear delineation of public vs. private data.\n- Ethical practices well documented.\n- Reproducibility: model and code availability implied but not confirmed; specifying release plan for MedRegInstruct (public vs. derived subsets) would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n## **Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n### **1. Summary**\nThe manuscript introduces **MedRegA**, a bilingual multimodal large language model for medical imaging that explicitly models **region-level understanding**. The authors define three region-centric tasks — region-to-text identification, text-to-region detection, and grounded report generation — and create the **MedRegInstruct** dataset (≈790K samples). Leveraging a hybrid of public and in-house clinical data, the model integrates bounding-box–based regional encoding, a *Regional Chain-of-Thought* reasoning strategy, and a *Region-Aligned evaluation framework*. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over prior medical MLLMs (MedDr, RadFM, BiomedGPT, etc.) across vision-language and classification tasks, with enhanced interpretability via spatial grounding.\n\n### **2. Strengths**\n- **Methodological novelty:** clear transition from global to region-aware MLLMs in medicine.\n- **Dataset innovation:** semi-automatic bilingual dataset that supports grounding and interpretability.\n- **Comprehensive evaluation:** large experimental suite across multiple modalities and languages.\n- **Clinical interpretability:** bounding-box reasoning improves trust and transparency.\n- **Ethical & bilingual scope:** multilingual component broadens utility for global medical datasets.\n\n### **3. Weaknesses**\n- **Novelty breadth:** approach builds atop existing LLM backbones; novelty lies in dataset and task definition rather than underlying architecture.\n- **Evaluation limitations:** limited human expert validation of clinical correctness and no reader study.\n- **Annotation accuracy:** automated bounding-box localization (72%) may limit reliability for fine-grained tasks.\n- **Reproducibility:** unclear public release of weights or dataset subsets; details on computing resources could be expanded.\n- **Writing:** some redundancy; figures occasionally crowded.\n\n### **4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify methodological novelty** relative to prior grounded-reporting models (e.g., Maira‑2, AutoRG‑Brain). Explicit comparison or ablation without region-centric training would strengthen claims.\n2. **Validation of regional accuracy**—Consider radiologist-level qualitative evaluation of MedRegA’s localized predictions to substantiate interpretability and clinical realism.\n3. **Dataset transparency**—Provide explicit plan for releasing de‑identified subsets and annotation tools, consistent with IEEE TMI reproducibility.\n4. **Generalization analysis**—Include experiments on unseen modalities or pathologies to assess model robustness and domain shift sensitivity.\n5. **Ablation and explainability**—Quantify how each component (MedRegInstruct, Regional CoT) contributes to improvements on VQA and report generation.\n\n### **5. Minor Comments**\n- Improve caption clarity in Figures 2, 4, 6.\n- Correct minor typos (e.g., “r egions t hey”, “interpertability”).\n- Provide parameter counts and inference speed.\n- Consider compressing large tables or moving secondary results to supplementary material.\n- Clarify whether “Region-Aligned Accuracy” ≥0.5 denotes threshold or normalized metric.\n\n### **6. Overall Recommendation**\n**Recommendation:** ★★★☆☆ **Major Revision**  \nWhile solid and relevant, the paper’s publication in *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging* would benefit from strengthened empirical validation (clinical/qualitative) and refinement of the novelty claims. The methodological framework is promising and aligns with *TMI’s* emphasis on interpretable medical imaging AI.\n\n### **7. Confidence Level**\n**4 / 5** – High confidence based on manuscript clarity, literature familiarity, and reproducible details.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nAn ambitious and well‑structured paper introducing a region‑aware paradigm for bilingual medical MLLMs. Methodologically interesting and well executed, yet requiring stronger experimental justification of clinical interpretability and fuller comparative discussion before meeting *IEEE TMI* acceptance standards.",

The paper is clearly written and technically detailed, though the clarity of figures and tables could be improved.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. The methodological novelty should be clarified relative to earlier grounded-reporting and region-aware vision-language models. Comparative experiments or ablations omitting region-centric training would help establish the unique contribution.  \n2. The evaluation would benefit from a radiologist-level qualitative assessment of regional localization accuracy to confirm the clinical interpretability of generated results.  \n3. Dataset transparency requires attention. The authors should specify clear plans for releasing de-identified subsets, annotation tools, and related assets to ensure reproducibility.  \n4. The current validation focuses primarily on known datasets; testing on unseen imaging modalities or pathologies would provide insight into robustness under domain shifts.  \n5. An ablation study isolating contributions of key components, such as *MedRegInstruct* and Regional Chain-of-Thought, should quantify their individual effects on VQA and report generation performance.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Improve the clarity and labeling of Figures 2, 4, and 6.  \n- Correct typographical errors (e.g., “r egions t hey,” “interpertability”).  \n- Report parameter counts and inference speed for transparency.  \n- Summarize key quantitative results in main tables and move secondary metrics to supplementary materials.  \n- Clarify the definition and thresholding of “Region-Aligned Accuracy.”  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the work presents a methodologically interesting and well-organized framework advancing region-aware multimodal modeling for medical imaging. Strengths include its structured dataset design, interpretability emphasis, and extensive experimental benchmarking. Remaining issues involve limited verification of clinical validity, somewhat incremental novelty, and incomplete reproducibility details. Addressing these concerns through expanded validation, clearer dataset release plans, and concise presentation would significantly strengthen the paper’s impact.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces MedRegA, a bilingual multimodal large language model designed to address region-centric tasks in medical imaging. The authors identify that existing medical MLLMs are region-agnostic, treating entire images holistically without focusing on specific anatomical regions. To address this limitation, they propose three region-centric tasks: Region-to-Text Identification, Text-to-Region Detection, and Grounded Report Generation. The authors construct MedRegInstruct, a large-scale dataset containing 550K region-text triplets and 240K grounded reports from both public datasets and 25K clinical scans from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital. MedRegA is built upon InternVL 1.2 and trained using alignment training followed by instruction tuning. Experimental results show improvements over existing methods across visual question answering, report generation, and medical image classification tasks, with the model achieving bilingual capabilities in both English and Chinese.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Dataset Construction and Validation Concerns**\n  - The automatic labeling system for structure detection achieves only 72% accuracy compared to human annotations (Page 5), which may introduce systematic errors that propagate through training and evaluation\n  - Human validation is limited to only 50 samples with 2 experts (Page 5), providing insufficient statistical power to assess dataset quality across the claimed 790K total samples\n  - The rule-based strategy for organ summarization and LLM-based report segmentation lacks detailed validation metrics beyond sentence-level accuracy of 93.33% (Page 5)\n\n• **Mathematical Formulation and Technical Specification Issues**\n  - Bounding box coordinates are normalized to integers within [0, 1000) (Page 6) but the paper lacks explanation of why this specific range was chosen or how it affects model performance\n  - The Region-Aligned evaluation framework introduces multiple complex metrics (Figure 6, Algorithm 1) but provides no theoretical justification or convergence analysis for the Hungarian Matching algorithm application\n  - Loss function specification is vague, stating only \"language model loss is applied\" (Page 6) without mathematical formulation or discussion of how region-specific losses are weighted\n\n• **Experimental Design and Evaluation Limitations**\n  - Baseline comparisons are problematic as most existing models cannot perform region-centric tasks (Table 1 shows \"✗\" for most baselines), making performance comparisons potentially misleading\n  - The Regional CoT evaluation (Table 14, Figure 19) lacks proper ablation studies to isolate the contribution of regional information versus improved prompting strategies\n  - Test set construction methodology is unclear, particularly for the bilingual evaluation where translation quality could significantly impact results (Tables 8, 10)\n\n• **Reproducibility and Implementation Concerns**\n  - Training details are relegated to appendix with insufficient hyperparameter specification in the main paper (Page 6 references \"Appendix B\" for critical implementation details)\n  - The semi-automatic pipeline for dataset construction involves multiple complex steps (Figure 3) but lacks sufficient detail for reproduction, particularly regarding the \"Doctor Finetuned MLLM\" component\n  - Clinical data collection protocol and ethical approval details are mentioned only briefly in ethics statement (Page 11) without adequate description of data preprocessing and anonymization procedures\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen Dataset Validation and Quality Assessment**\n  - Expand human validation to at least 500 samples across different modalities and anatomical regions to provide statistically meaningful quality assessment\n  - Provide detailed inter-annotator agreement scores (e.g., Cohen's kappa) for both bounding box accuracy and report segmentation quality\n  - Include analysis of how the 72% structure detection accuracy affects downstream model performance and implement error correction mechanisms\n\n• **Enhance Mathematical Rigor and Technical Clarity**\n  - Provide mathematical justification for the [0, 1000) normalization range choice and include ablation studies comparing different coordinate encoding schemes\n  - Formalize the loss function with explicit mathematical notation, including how region-specific and text-specific losses are combined and weighted\n  - Add theoretical analysis of the Hungarian Matching algorithm's computational complexity and convergence properties within the evaluation framework\n\n• **Improve Experimental Design and Analysis**\n  - Develop region-capable versions of baseline models through fine-tuning on region-centric tasks to enable fair comparison, or clearly acknowledge this limitation in the evaluation\n  - Conduct comprehensive ablation studies separating the effects of regional information, improved prompting, and bilingual training\n  - Implement cross-validation procedures for test set construction and provide confidence intervals for all reported metrics\n\n• **Enhance Reproducibility and Documentation**\n  - Move critical implementation details from appendix to main paper, including complete hyperparameter specifications, training procedures, and convergence criteria\n  - Provide detailed algorithmic descriptions and code snippets for the semi-automatic dataset construction pipeline\n  - Include comprehensive supplementary materials with dataset statistics, preprocessing steps, and detailed experimental protocols to ensure full reproducibility",

        "text": "## INTERPRETABLE BILINGUAL MULTIMODAL LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL FOR DIVERSE BIOMEDICAL TASKS\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes MedRegA, a bilingual region-aware medical multimodal large language model that unifies image-level and region-level tasks across multiple modalities. The authors construct MedRegInstruct, a large-scale dataset spanning three “Region-Centric” tasks (Region-to-Text identification, Text-to-Region detection, and Grounded Report Generation), and introduce a Region-Aligned evaluation framework and a Regional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) inference strategy. Experiments suggest that MedRegA improves on general medical VQA, report generation, classification, and the newly defined region-centric tasks, with qualitative gains in interpretability via bounding-box grounding.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntroduces a coherent suite of region-centric tasks (identify, detect, ground) for medical MLLMs and encodes regions with explicitandtokens to steer spatial reasoning.Proposes a practical Regional CoT strategy (localize first, then reason) that is intuitive for clinical workflows and shows measurable gains in multi-label settings.Presents a Region-Aligned evaluation protocol decomposed into object-, region-, and alignment-level metrics, which is a step beyond purely textual evaluation.\n- Experimental rigor and validationEvaluates MedRegA on a broad task set (VQA, report generation, classification, three region-centric tasks) and in both English and Chinese settings.Provides qualitative examples showing improved localization and more specific, grounded descriptions.\n- Clarity of presentationClearly delineates the three region-centric tasks and the associated tokenization scheme for region representation.The pipeline for data construction (report refinement, structure detection, and human validation) is explained with reasonable transparency.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a pressing and widely recognized gap in medical MLLMs: weak spatial grounding and limited interpretability for region-specific findings.Bilingual capability and cross-modality coverage broaden potential utility and suggest a path toward more generalist, interpretable assistants.\n\n- Introduces a coherent suite of region-centric tasks (identify, detect, ground) for medical MLLMs and encodes regions with explicitandtokens to steer spatial reasoning.\n- Proposes a practical Regional CoT strategy (localize first, then reason) that is intuitive for clinical workflows and shows measurable gains in multi-label settings.\n- Presents a Region-Aligned evaluation protocol decomposed into object-, region-, and alignment-level metrics, which is a step beyond purely textual evaluation.\n\n- Evaluates MedRegA on a broad task set (VQA, report generation, classification, three region-centric tasks) and in both English and Chinese settings.\n- Provides qualitative examples showing improved localization and more specific, grounded descriptions.\n\n- Clearly delineates the three region-centric tasks and the associated tokenization scheme for region representation.\n- The pipeline for data construction (report refinement, structure detection, and human validation) is explained with reasonable transparency.\n\n- Addresses a pressing and widely recognized gap in medical MLLMs: weak spatial grounding and limited interpretability for region-specific findings.\n- Bilingual capability and cross-modality coverage broaden potential utility and suggest a path toward more generalist, interpretable assistants.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe grounded components rely heavily on bounding boxes with only moderate human validation (72% accuracy over 50 samples), raising concerns about noise in supervision and evaluation.Central-slice extraction for 3D CT/MRI inputs discards volumetric context, which is critical for many clinical tasks and localization fidelity.The “first bilingual generalist” claim should be nuanced in light of concurrent region-aware or expert-augmented systems and large-scale grounding frameworks (e.g., VILA-M3, Med-GLIP), and CXR-specific grounded VQA/report pipelines (e.g., GEMeX, AutoRG-Brain).\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesRegion-centric evaluation is largely based on constructed/derived data from SA-Med2D and in-house/MIMIC pipelines; external region-grounding benchmarks (e.g., GEMeX V-score, Med-GLIP-style AP/AP50) are missing.Many baselines are not region-capable by design and are marked “X”; comparisons to recent region-aware medical models and grounding-first frameworks are limited.VQA reporting relies on generic NLG metrics (BLEU-1, BertScore) instead of standardized answer accuracy for each dataset; the averaging across datasets and metrics reduces interpretability of results.Minimal ablation on the contribution of each dataset component, the/tokenization, and the Regional CoT steps; no calibration or hallucination analysis.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSome tables contain formatting artifacts and unusual metric choices (e.g., “CloseAccuracy,” “OpenRecall”) without clear definitions or dataset-specific protocols, making reproducibility and judgment difficult.The definition of evaluation thresholds and matching strategies for multi-object multi-region detection could be further clarified with examples and sensitivity analyses.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited engagement with sequence/temporal and multi-view grounding benchmarks (e.g., MedSG-Bench) that are clinically relevant.Absent comparisons to large, region-level pretraining frameworks (e.g., Med-GLIP) and grounded VQA/report datasets (e.g., GEMeX, GEMeX-RMCoT; AutoRG-Brain for MRI; ChestX-Reasoner for process supervision).No analysis of leveraging or integrating external expert modules (e.g., segmentation experts as in VILA-M3) vs. end-to-end region tokenization.\n\n- The grounded components rely heavily on bounding boxes with only moderate human validation (72% accuracy over 50 samples), raising concerns about noise in supervision and evaluation.\n- Central-slice extraction for 3D CT/MRI inputs discards volumetric context, which is critical for many clinical tasks and localization fidelity.\n- The “first bilingual generalist” claim should be nuanced in light of concurrent region-aware or expert-augmented systems and large-scale grounding frameworks (e.g., VILA-M3, Med-GLIP), and CXR-specific grounded VQA/report pipelines (e.g., GEMeX, AutoRG-Brain).\n\n- Region-centric evaluation is largely based on constructed/derived data from SA-Med2D and in-house/MIMIC pipelines;

however, the conversion from masks to boxes (SA-Med2D) and reliance on auto-detected regions in in-house data likely introduce systematic bias (e.g., oversized boxes).The two-stage inference (Regional CoT) aligns with clinical reading workflows. A more formalized failure-mode analysis (missed small lesions, multi-focal disease, diffuse patterns) would strengthen claims, especially since boxes are lossy for irregular pathology.Freezing the vision encoder and focusing updates on the language model may limit representation learning for fine-grained localization; an ablation on partial vision finetuning could clarify trade-offs.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentStrong breadth across tasks, but depth is uneven: region-centric tasks are primarily evaluated on internal/derived data; external, standardized region-aware benchmarks are needed to substantiate generalization.VQA metrics: BLEU-1 and BertScore are not standard for answer evaluation; use dataset-specific accuracy or semantic answer matching, and report per-dataset scores rather than averages.Grounded report generation: reporting both NLG and clinical efficacy (CheXpert, RadGraph, RadCliQ) for CXR is good; including human grading (error taxonomies, RaTE) and inter-rater agreement would make the clinical significance clearer.The 72% box “accuracy” on a small validation (n=50) suggests meaningful annotation noise. Provide IoU distributions and sensitivity to IoU thresholds; quantify how noise propagates to model performance.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Med-GLIP demonstrates large-scale, modality-aware region supervision that boosts downstream VQA and MRG; comparing MedRegA’s region detection to Med-GLIP-style AP/AP50 on shared subsets would contextualize progress.GEMeX provides chest X-ray VQA with explicit textual explanations and grounding (V-score); evaluating MedRegA on GEMeX would test transfer beyond your constructed data and directly assess visual grounding.AutoRG-Brain (grounded report generation for brain MRI) and MedRegion-CT (region-focused chest CT reports) explore pixel/region grounding with 3D context; the present 2D central-slice strategy is a limitation relative to these methods’ volumetric reasoning.ChestX-Reasoner and GEMeX-RMCoT highlight process supervision and verifiable rewards to align reasoning with evidence; MedRegA’s Regional CoT could be extended with verifiable or consistency-based rewards to reduce hallucinations and improve robustness.MedSG-Bench emphasizes clinically motivated sequence grounding; the present single-image grounding could be extended and evaluated in multi-view/temporal settings for greater clinical fidelity.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceExplicit localization tied to generated text improves interpretability and supports clinician verification, which is vital for trust and adoption.Bilingual capability is valuable; however, reliance on non-released in-house Chinese data limits reproducibility and external validation; consider releasing de-identified evaluation-only subsets or synthetic-but-validated proxies.A region-centric paradigm is well aligned with safety goals but should be complemented with calibration, uncertainty estimation, and guardrails against confident but wrong localizations.\n- Data quality, ethics, and reproducibilityMore extensive human validation of the auto-annotations is needed (larger sample size, multiple raters, inter-rater agreement). Present per-organ/per-lesion performance to identify where auto-labeling is most/least reliable.Clarify what portions of MedRegInstruct will be released, with licensing and patient privacy safeguards. Without the in-house portion, claims for Chinese/bilingual performance are hard to reproduce.\n- Metrics and evaluation designFor detection, add standard detection metrics (AP, AP50, AP75) and recall/precision curves; for grounding, report mIoU with Hungarian matching for multi-box cases (as in GEMeX) and alignment accuracy.For VQA, use answer accuracy or GPTScore-like semantic measures for open-ended items; reduce reliance on BLEU-1 for short answers.Provide per-dataset, per-modality breakdowns rather than only averages; report statistical significance or confidence intervals.\n- Model design and ablationsInclude ablations on: with/without region tokens; with/without Region-Text vs grounded-report subsets; proportion of Chinese vs English data; Regional CoT’s stage-1 detector accuracy vs final task performance; and partial finetuning of the vision encoder.Explore alternatives to box-only grounding (mask tokens or referring segmentation) for multi-focal/diffuse pathologies and small lesions.\n- Interpretability and clinical utilityAdd clinician-centered evaluations: time-to-review, correction effort, error taxonomy (omission, wrong location/description), and user studies on whether grounded outputs improve trust and workflow.Provide examples of failure cases and discuss mitigation (e.g., uncertainty flags when localization confidence is low).\n- Bilingual and cross-domain considerationsShow cross-lingual transfer (train English → test Chinese and vice versa) and error analyses by language. Clarify how bilingual prompts and tokenization handle medical synonyms and nomenclature.\n\n- The region tokenization scheme and integer-normalized box coordinates are reasonable and easy to implement; however, the conversion from masks to boxes (SA-Med2D) and reliance on auto-detected regions in in-house data likely introduce systematic bias (e.g., oversized boxes).\n- The two-stage inference (Regional CoT) aligns with clinical reading workflows.

Can you provide IoU histograms, per-class box quality, and sensitivity analyses to different IoU thresholds beyond 0.5?\n- Can you evaluate MedRegA’s grounding on external benchmarks such as GEMeX (V-score) and report detection AP metrics in the style of Med-GLIP, to better assess generalization?\n- What exact definitions and dataset-specific protocols underlie “CloseAccuracy,” “OpenRecall,” and other nonstandard metrics in Table 1? Please provide per-dataset results and accuracy metrics commonly used by those benchmarks.\n- How do results change when the vision encoder is partially finetuned vs. frozen? Is the strong region localization driven mostly by the language head learning coordinate patterns?\n- For CT/MRI, what is the impact of using central slices vs. 3D context on region detection and report grounding? Have you explored 2.5D or lightweight volumetric context?\n- Regional CoT adds an extra inference pass; what is the computational overhead and how does it scale with multiple regions? Any batching or caching strategies to keep latency acceptable?\n- How do you handle multi-focal and diffuse abnormalities where rectangular boxes are inadequate? Have you considered mask-based grounding or referring segmentation?\n- Could you provide more extensive human evaluation for grounded report quality (e.g., RaTE, radiologist scoring, inter-rater agreement), especially in the Chinese setting?\n- What parts of MedRegInstruct (especially grounded subsets) will be released, and how can others reproduce your Chinese evaluation?\n- How does MedRegA compare to region-aware or expert-augmented systems like Med-GLIP and VILA-M3 on shared tasks when those systems’ outputs are adapted to your evaluation (or vice versa)?\n- Do you have calibration or uncertainty estimates for localization and descriptions, and can the model abstain when uncertain about a region?\n- Have you analyzed error modes where incorrect localization leads to downstream diagnostic mistakes, and can Regional CoT be extended with verifiable rewards to mitigate this?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper tackles an important and understudied aspect of medical MLLMs: explicit, interpretable regional grounding aligned with textual outputs. The introduction of a unified set of region-centric tasks, a region-aligned evaluation protocol, and a pragmatic Regional CoT strategy is meaningful, and the breadth of bilingual, multi-modality experiments is promising. However, several issues limit the strength of the claims: heavy reliance on auto-annotated boxes with modest human validation, limited external benchmarking against region-aware datasets/frameworks, and evaluation choices that obscure per-dataset accuracy and fairness relative to baselines. The technical novelty is moderate in view of closely related contemporary efforts (e.g., Med-GLIP, GEMeX, AutoRG-Brain, VILA-M3), though the bilingual generalist framing and unification of tasks are valuable. With stronger external evaluations, clearer metrics, deeper ablations, larger-scale human validation, and more cautious claims contextualized against recent region-aware systems, this work could make a solid contribution to the field and be competitive at a top venue.",

        "text": "# IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging Review Report\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses a critical limitation in current medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) – their region-agnostic nature that prevents them from identifying which specific regions they focus on when generating medical reports or answers. The authors propose MedRegA, a bilingual region-aware medical MLLM that simultaneously handles both image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across eight different modalities. The key innovation is the introduction of Region-Centric tasks (Region-to-Text Identification, Text-to-Region Detection, and Grounded Report Generation) along with a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, containing over 790,000 region-annotated medical samples. The authors demonstrate that MedRegA significantly outperforms existing models across multiple benchmarks, achieving 67.65 BLEU-1 in visual question answering (3.91% improvement over MedDr), 40.46 BLEU-1 in English report generation (5.97% improvement), and 47.97 F1 score in medical image classification (15.32% improvement). Most notably, the model excels in region-centric tasks with 69.72 BLEU-1 in Region-to-Text Identification and 76.59% region accuracy in Grounded Report Generation, while providing interpretable outputs that associate generated text with specific anatomical regions in medical images.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths\n- **Critical Problem Addressed**: The paper identifies and addresses a fundamental limitation in current medical MLLMs – their inability to specify which regions they focus on, which severely impacts clinical interpretability and trustworthiness.\n- **Comprehensive Dataset**: The MedRegInstruct dataset (550K region-text pairs and 240K grounded reports) covers 8 modalities, multiple body regions, and bilingual (English/Chinese) capabilities, addressing a significant gap in existing medical vision-language resources.\n- **Strong Performance Improvements**: The model demonstrates substantial performance gains across diverse medical tasks, with particularly impressive results in region-centric capabilities where previous models fail completely.\n- **Innovative Regional CoT**: The proposed Chain-of-Thought approach that first detects regions before answering questions provides a practical method to leverage the model's region-aware capabilities for improved clinical reasoning.\n\n### Major Limitations\n- **Limited Clinical Validation**: While the model shows strong quantitative results, there is no evaluation with actual clinicians regarding the practical usefulness of region-centric outputs for clinical decision-making.\n- **Lack of Failure Analysis**: The paper does not systematically analyze failure cases, particularly for complex scenarios with subtle abnormalities or when region identification fails.\n- **Computational Resources**: There is no discussion of the computational cost and resource requirements for training/deploying the model, which could impact clinical adoption.\n- **Medical Specificity**: The paper doesn't clearly articulate how the region-centric approach specifically addresses clinical workflow needs beyond improving metrics.\n\n### Minor Strengths\n- **Well-Structured Evaluation**: The comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and modalities provides strong evidence of the model's versatility.\n- **Effective Visualizations**: The figures effectively demonstrate the model's capabilities, particularly the side-by-side comparisons showing region-specific reasoning.\n- **Bilingual Capability**: The inclusion of Chinese language processing significantly extends the potential global impact of the work.\n\n### Minor Limitations\n- **Figure Clarity**: Some figures (e.g., Figure 8) could be simplified for better readability while maintaining their informative value.\n- **Length Management**: The paper is quite lengthy; certain sections in the appendix could be condensed or moved to supplementary materials.\n- **Architectural Details**: More specific information about the architectural modifications made to the base model would enhance technical understanding.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Along TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance**: High. The region-centric approach addresses a fundamental limitation in medical AI interpretability that directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. By enabling models to specify which regions they're analyzing, this work moves medical MLLMs closer to mimicking clinician reasoning patterns. The bilingual capability further enhances global relevance, and the demonstrated improvements across multiple clinical tasks suggest meaningful potential for real-world impact.\n\n**Innovation**: High. The paper introduces three novel Region-Centric tasks specifically designed for medical MLLMs, along with a comprehensive dataset to support them. While region grounding has been explored in general vision-language models, this work is the first to systematically apply it across diverse medical modalities with clinical relevance. The Regional CoT approach is also an innovative application of the model's capabilities.\n\n**Evaluation**: Good. The evaluation is comprehensive across multiple dimensions (VQA, report generation, classification, and region-centric tasks) and modalities. The region-aligned evaluation framework is well-designed for the proposed tasks. However, the clinical utility evaluation is lacking – the paper would benefit from clinician feedback on the practical value of region-specific outputs for diagnostic reasoning.\n\n**Reproducibility**: Good. The paper provides extensive details on dataset construction, model architecture, and training procedures in both the main text and appendix. The authors mention releasing code and dataset (via a project page), and the detailed descriptions enable replication. More specific information about hyperparameters and computational requirements would further enhance reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThis paper presents a significant advancement in medical multimodal AI by addressing the critical limitation of region-agnostic processing in current models. The comprehensive dataset, strong performance improvements, and innovative region-centric approach make this a valuable contribution to the field. The paper is well-structured and thoroughly evaluated, with clear demonstrations of the model's capabilities.\n\nHowever, the paper would benefit from revisions addressing the clinical relevance of the region-centric approach and providing more analysis of failure cases. The authors should include:\n1) A discussion of how the region-specific outputs align with actual clinical workflow needs\n2) Analysis of failure cases, particularly where region identification impacts diagnostic accuracy\n3) Information on computational requirements for potential clinical deployment\n\nThese revisions would strengthen the clinical significance of the work without requiring additional major experiments. The current version is already strong, but addressing these points would make it an exemplary contribution to medical imaging AI research.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThis work tackles a notable shortcoming of current medical multimodal large language models: they treat an image as a single, undifferentiated entity and cannot indicate which anatomical region is responsible for a particular textual output. To endow the models with spatial awareness, the authors propose three region‑centric tasks—region‑to‑text identification, text‑to‑region detection, and grounded report generation. They also build a large‑scale bilingual dataset, **MedRegInstruct**, that pairs image regions with textual descriptions and region‑grounded reports across a wide range of modalities (X‑ray, CT, MRI, pathology, dermatology, ophthalmology). Using this dataset together with other medical multimodal corpora, they fine‑tune the vision‑language model InternVL, resulting in **MedRegA**, a multilingual medical MLLM that can reason about specific image regions. Experimental results demonstrate that MedRegA produces accurate region annotations, improves performance on visual question answering, report generation, and image classification, and can generate reports that are explicitly linked to image regions. The main contribution is the integration of region‑centric capabilities into a bilingual, general‑purpose medical AI system.\n\n---\n\n**## General feedback**\n\n*Significance.*  \nThe introduction of region grounding together with bilingual support addresses a real clinical demand for interpretable AI that can point to the precise anatomical structures underlying its predictions. Figure 2(a) nicely illustrates how this capability could increase trust and usability in practice.\n\n*Innovation.*  \nThe novelty of the paper is three‑fold: (1) defining the three region‑centric tasks and assembling a sizable, partially automatically annotated dataset that spans many imaging modalities; (2) proposing a box‑token encoding together with a “Regional CoT” inference scheme (see Figure 5); and (3) embedding both English and Chinese report generation within a single unified model. While grounding has been studied for natural‑image datasets, applying it systematically to diverse medical imaging modalities is a fresh contribution.\n\n*Evaluation.*  \nThe authors evaluate on a broad spectrum of benchmarks—VQA (SLAKE, VQA‑RAD, PathVQA, PMC‑VQA), report generation (MIMIC‑CXR, IU‑Xray, an in‑house Chinese set), image classification (VinDr series, CheXpert, ISIC, etc.)—as well as the newly introduced region‑centric tasks (Tables 2‑5). Reported gains are impressive (e.g., +8 % BLEU‑1 on MIMIC‑CXR compared with MedDr, +27 % IoU on lesion‑grounded reports versus InternVL). A limitation, however, is that most tables present only point estimates; confidence intervals or statistical tests are missing, and baseline comparisons sometimes juxtapose zero‑shot results with fine‑tuned ones (Table 13).\n\n*Reproducibility.*  \nThe manuscript provides high‑level information about data sources, hardware, and hyper‑parameters (Section B). Important details such as the exact train/validation splits of MedRegInstruct, the LoRA rank and learning‑rate, the full set of prompt templates (only Figure 12 is shown), and the implementation of the Region‑Aligned evaluation (Algorithm 1) are not released. Moreover, the MedRegInstruct dataset (particularly the in‑house portion) and the trained checkpoints are unavailable, which hampers independent verification.\n\n---\n\n**## Specific comments / critiques**\n\n1. **Annotation quality** – The automatically generated bounding boxes attain a modest 72 % agreement with human annotations (Section 3.2). The manuscript does not explore how this level of noise influences downstream performance.\n\n2. **Dataset split clarity** – A 90 %/10 % split is mentioned for the Chinese in‑house data, but the patient‑level partitioning for the full MedRegInstruct corpus is not disclosed. Potential leakage across tasks therefore remains unclear (Section A).\n\n3. **Baseline fairness** – Comparisons to existing medical MLLMs (MedFlamingo, LLaVA‑Med, MedDr) are largely zero‑shot, whereas MedRegA benefits from fine‑tuning on MedRegInstruct. A controlled experiment where the baselines are also fine‑tuned on the same data would strengthen the claims; Table 13 only includes a limited 5 K subset.\n\n4. **Bilingual evaluation limited** – Chinese report generation is evaluated solely on an internal dataset (Table 8). No external Chinese benchmark is used, making it difficult to assess generalisation beyond the collected hospital data.\n\n5. **Statistical significance absent** – All performance tables (e.g., Tables 1‑7, 14) present single numbers without confidence intervals or hypothesis testing, limiting confidence in the robustness of the reported gains.\n\n6. **External grounding baselines omitted** – Recent vision‑language models that support region grounding (e.g., RegionGPT, Kosmos‑2) are not adapted for comparison. Consequently it is unclear whether the improvements stem primarily from the new dataset or from architectural choices.\n\n7. **Region‑Aligned evaluation novelty not benchmarked** – The proposed evaluation (Algorithm 1, Figure 6) is novel but is not compared against established grounding metrics such as the pointing game or mean IoU that are common in the vision‑language literature.\n\n8. **Ablation of model components missing** – The impact of freezing the vision encoder and language model during alignment training versus jointly fine‑tuning them is not quantified. Likewise, the benefit of the `<box>` token relative to a simple concatenation is not isolated.\n\n9. **Regional CoT details scarce** – Table 14 shows substantial gains on multi‑label classification and VQA, yet the exact prompting format, detection thresholds, and the mechanism by which region detections are fed back to the language model are not fully described (Figure 5 offers only a schematic).\n\n10. **Clinical validation only qualitative** – The paper includes illustrative examples (Figures 2(a), 13, 17) but lacks a prospective or retrospective user study with radiologists that would substantiate the claimed interpretability improvements.\n\n---\n\n**## A suggested decision**\n\n**Reject**\n\n*Rationale.* While the manuscript presents an interesting direction—adding region‑aware, bilingual capabilities to medical MLLMs—it falls short of the journal’s standards for methodological rigor, reproducibility, and comprehensive evaluation. Addressing the points above would be necessary before the work could be considered for publication.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation.

The dataset provides the most enriched annotations for various multimodal tasks, such as captioning, classification, and segmentation, and supports the pre-training of advanced multimodal medical AI models, achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.\tThe paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, the largest multimodal medical dataset to date, featuring multigranular annotations and containing over 25 million triplets (image-ROI-description). The development of an automated data annotation pipeline significantly scales up medical image-text data.\n2.\tWith the support of MedTrinity-25M, the pretrained CLIP and LLaVA models demonstrate better performance compared to previous methods.\n3.\tThe release of this dataset contributes to the medical AI community, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable resource for advancing multimodal tasks and improving healthcare applications.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1.\tThe quality of the generated image-text data may not be sufficiently high. It is advisable to review the questions associated with this data. In the image-captioning constructed from MedTrinity-25M, we found that many basic imaging modalities were incorrectly identified. For instance, in the CT-RATE data used as the source, over 60,000 images were misidentified as MRI, more than 90,000 as X-ray, and even a small number were identified as endoscopy. Below, we provide some captions to illustrate this phenomenon present in MedTrinity-25M.\n“””\n{\"image_path\":\"seg_train_126_a_2-right lung.nii-34.jpg\",\"id\":\"b573995e-2d11-11ef-bbea-f02f74942466\",\"caption\":\"The image is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the thoracic region, showing the heart, part of the lung, and the spine.

The comparison of multimodal large models is limited to VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA. A broader range of specialized benchmarks, such as the health subset of MMMU, could provide a more robust comparison of the multimodal large models’ performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.\tThe data construction pipeline consists of two main steps: first, generating 200,000 multigranular textual descriptions via GPT-4V, and then fine-tuning LLaVA with this dataset. In my opinion, the performance of the trained model LLaVA-MedCap is significantly influenced by the quality of the data generated by GPT-4V. However, in Table 3, GPT-4V's performance falls far short of LLaVA-Tri. Why did you choose to use GPT-4V to generate the supervised fine-tuning data for the fine-tuning process? In my recent review of the publicly released MedTrinity-25M data, I found that many of the generated data instances were of average quality, with even simple modalities being incorrect.\n2.\tIn Section 4.1, it is stated that “The model is fine-tuned for three epochs on each VQA dataset and evaluated accordingly.” However, this evaluation setup is not fair when comparing with the methods presented in the table. Some results in Table 3 appear to be directly extracted from llava-med’s table, but these methods were not fine-tuned on the training set of the VQA benchmark. In contrast, the accuracy of the chosen llava-med method was achieved after fine-tuning for 15 epochs on the corresponding VQA benchmark training set, making this comparison inappropriate.\nCurrently, the evaluation paradigm for multimodal large models (MLLM) typically involves assessing the model directly on multiple benchmarks after two stages of pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. Therefore, I suggested distinguishing the results presented: there should be a comparison of the results not fine-tuned on the corresponding training set against the models that were not fine-tuned. Additionally, when comparing with methods fine-tuned on the corresponding training set, the number of fine-tuning epochs (including for the comparison methods) should be clearly indicated. If possible, please also conduct an ablation study regarding the number of fine-tuning epochs.\n3.\tIn Table 3, comparing CLIP-like models with LLaVA, a multimodal large model, seems inappropriate. It would be better to categorize them into two groups: one for CLIP models and another for MLLM.\n4.\tThe evaluation details in Table 3&4 are not clearly explained. What do \"open\" and \"close\" specifically refer to?  Please add a brief explanation of the \"open\" and \"close\" terms in the table caption or in the text describing the results.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n- Yes, Other reasons (please specify below)\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

These raise questions about the accuracy of the automatic caption generation process and the reliability of the resulting dataset.  \n2. **Limited Experimental Scope:** Model comparisons are restricted to three datasets (VQA‑RAD, SLAKE, PathVQA). Inclusion of more specialized or diverse benchmarks, such as the health subset of MMMU, would enhance the robustness of the evaluation.  \n3. **Choice of GPT‑4V for Data Generation:** Since GPT‑4V’s own performance is lower than that of LLaVA‑Tri, it is unclear why GPT‑4V was used to generate supervision data for fine‑tuning.

The reviewer suggests distinguishing results obtained with and without fine‑tuning, clearly stating the number of epochs used, and conducting an ablation on fine‑tuning duration.  \n5. **Comparison Structure:** It would be more appropriate to separate CLIP‑like models from large language–vision models (LLaVA) rather than comparing them directly.  \n6. **Unclear Terminology:** The meaning of the “open” and “close” evaluation setups in Tables 3 & 4 is not explained and should be clarified in the captions or main text.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The captioned examples reveal inconsistent modality terminology and possible mislabeling that require correction.  \n- Some descriptions could be streamlined for clarity when presenting evaluation procedures or dataset construction steps.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis submission introduces a uniquely large multimodal medical dataset with potentially substantial community benefit.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a large-scale multimodal medical dataset comprising over 25 million images across 10 imaging modalities and covering more than 65 diseases. The dataset features multigranular annotations that include both global information and local information. The authors develop an automated pipeline that generates image-ROI-description triplets without the need for paired textual descriptions. This pipeline utilizes domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs and prompts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce detailed annotations through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Dataset Comprehensiveness: The dataset is exceptionally extensive, encompassing a wide array of imaging modalities, diseases, and anatomical structures. This diversity significantly enhances its comprehensiveness and utility for various medical AI applications.\n- Construction Pipeline through Advanced Models: The utilization of domain-specific expert models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for annotation substantially enriches the dataset. This approach adds multigranular details that improve the quality and depth of the annotations, making the dataset more valuable for training sophisticated models.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Limited Applicability for Visual Data without ROIs: The proposed pipeline relies heavily on regions of interest (ROIs) for constructing multimodal data pairs. For visual data that lack explicit ROI annotations, it is unclear how the pipeline can be effectively applied. This limitation may restrict the dataset's usability across the full spectrum of medical images, particularly those where ROI determination is challenging or subjective.\n- Impact of Multigranular Information Not Fully Explored: While Tables 3 and 4 validate the effectiveness of the benchmark in general terms, the paper does not specifically assess how the inclusion of multigranular information, such as ROIs, influences the performance of medical MLLMs. Given that ROI is a pivotal component of the dataset, a focused evaluation comparing models trained with and without multigranular information would strengthen the claims about its benefits.\n- Insufficient Discussion of Related Benchmarks: The paper lacks a thorough discussion of existing med-MLLM benchmarks that involve multigranular information. Notably, works like \"GMAI-MMBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark Towards General Medical AI\" and \"A Spectrum Evaluation Benchmark for Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models\" are not cited or compared against. Including a comparative analysis would provide context and clarify how MedTrinity-25M advances the field relative to existing resources.\n- Lack of Evaluation on Multigranular-Specific Tasks: The dataset is primarily used for training and is evaluated only on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA. These evaluations may not fully capture the effectiveness of the dataset's multigranular annotations since they do not specifically target tasks designed to leverage such detailed information. This omission raises questions about the practical benefits of the multigranular data provided.\n- Challenges with Unique Medical Image Descriptions in RAG: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique used for annotation relies on a general medical knowledge base. However, medical images often have unique features and presentations, even within the same disease category. For example, Atelectasis can manifest differently in chest X-rays depending on the affected lobe. The paper does not address how the RAG system accounts for these unique variations when the initial visual datasets typically offer only generic classification labels. This could impact the accuracy and specificity of the generated annotations.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Handling of Visual Data Without ROIs: For medical images that lack explicit ROI annotations, how does your pipeline construct the corresponding multimodal data pairs? Is there a mechanism to generate or infer ROIs in such cases, or is the pipeline limited to images where ROIs are predefined?\n- Assessing the Impact of Multigranular Information on Med-MLLMs: Considering that ROIs and multigranular annotations are central to your dataset, have you conducted experiments to evaluate how these features specifically affect the performance of medical MLLMs? Can you provide insights or results that demonstrate the advantages of including multigranular information in model training?\n- Comparison with Existing Multigranular Benchmarks: Could you elaborate on how MedTrinity-25M compares with existing benchmarks that involve multigranular information? What distinguishes your dataset from these, and how does it contribute uniquely to the advancement of general medical AI?\n- Evaluation on Multigranular-Specific Tasks: Given that the dataset is evaluated only on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, which may not fully utilize multigranular annotations, do you have plans to test your dataset on tasks specifically designed for multigranular information? How can you demonstrate the effectiveness of your dataset's detailed annotations in improving model performance on such tasks?\n- Addressing Unique Medical Image Presentations in RAG: Medical images often present unique and variable features even when categorized under the same disease label. How does your RAG approach handle the specificity and variability of individual medical image descriptions? For instance, with conditions like Atelectasis that can manifest differently in imaging, how does the system ensure that the generated annotations accurately reflect these variations?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

Overall, the paper is clearly written and conveys a significant scaling effort in medical imaging data creation.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Automation and Scalability:** The automated labeling process substantially reduces manual annotation but may not scale easily to new modalities or emerging diseases that were not covered by domain‑specific models.  \n2. **Annotation Quality:** Automated labels may not achieve the precision of expert annotations, raising concerns about reliability in clinical or safety‑critical uses. The paper should explain how labeling quality is validated and maintained.  \n3. **Dataset Biases:** With data aggregated from more than 30 sources, potential biases in image quality, demographic distribution, and disease prevalence need deeper analysis and mitigation strategies.  \n4. **Knowledge Base Dependence:** Since the approach draws upon external medical knowledge bases, its performance could vary with updates to these sources. The paper should clarify versioning and update practices.  \n5. **Benchmark Overlap:** There is a risk that MedTrinity‑25M overlaps with benchmark datasets (e.g., RAD, PathVQA, SLAKE), which could inflate evaluation results. Explicit verification of non‑overlap is necessary.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify whether human experts have reviewed a subset of automated annotations.  \n- Provide more detail on expandability to unrepresented modalities or diseases.  \n- Include quantitative comparison with expert‑labeled datasets to assess annotation accuracy.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis work presents an ambitious and potentially impactful dataset that could advance multimodal medical AI research. Strengths include the scale of data collection, broad domain coverage, and demonstrated utility in downstream tasks. However, concerns remain regarding annotation reliability, possible dataset bias, dependence on external knowledge sources, and evaluation fairness. Addressing these points would enhance confidence in both the dataset’s reproducibility and the robustness of the reported model performance.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision.**",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript proposes a methodological framework for automated, large‐scale generation of multimodal medical datasets. Though the main product is a dataset (MedTrinity‑25M), the work also introduces a structured pipeline—integrating expert segmentation models, retrieval‑augmented generation, and multimodal large language models—to synthesize “image–ROI–description” triplets. This development directly concerns imaging data curation and quantitative annotation methodology, falling within TMI’s methodological scope.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe pipeline departs from existing datasets (e.g., MIMIC‑CXR, PMC‑OA, Quilt‑1M) by removing the need for expert text pairing. Generative annotation of multigranular information (global + local + regionwise correlations) constitutes a fresh methodological idea. While some components rely on existing tools (e.g., pretrained LLMs, segmentation networks), their orchestration for scalable medical data generation and evaluation offers an original contribution. The empirical section on re‑training LLaVA provides proof‑of‑concept rather than foundational modeling advance, so the novelty centers on dataset construction and validation.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe description is detailed: data sources (30+, 25 M images), clear pipeline steps (metadata integration, ROI localization, knowledge retrieval), and both expert and LLM evaluations are provided. However, reproducibility would benefit from explicit release of processing code, model prompts, and quality control statistics per modality. The medical knowledge retrieval and privacy safeguards need slightly more elaboration (e.g., IRB considerations for reused clinical data).\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe paper is mostly clear though dense. Occasional grammar and formatting issues (e.g., duplicated spaces, capitalization) should be corrected. Figures effectively illustrate qualitative comparisons. The flow between Sections 3.2.1–3.2.2 could be tightened for readability.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nSources appear to derive from publicly available datasets, and data are said to be de‑identified. The manuscript asserts public release but should include a clear statement on license compliance and absence of protected health information. Code and generation prompts are outlined but not yet openly documented—important for transparency and validation.\n\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe paper presents *MedTrinity‑25M*, a large‑scale multimodal medical image dataset (≈25 M samples across 10 modalities). It introduces an automated pipeline that combines metadata integration, ROI localization (via ensemble of domain‑specific models), and retrieval‑augmented generation with medically tuned LLMs to produce structured “image–ROI–description” triplets. Using this dataset, the authors pre‑train an enhanced multimodal model (*LLaVA‑Tri*) that demonstrates improved accuracy on standard medical VQA benchmarks.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- First systematic framework to scale medical multimodal data generation without human text pairing.  \n- Detailed integration of vision and language modules, enabling multigranular annotations (global/local/relational).  \n- Extensive comparative evaluation against existing datasets and validation using both expert and LLM scoring.  \n- Demonstrated utility through downstream performance gains on multiple benchmarks.  \n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Limited methodological novelty in model architecture (fine‑tuning existing components).  \n- Ethical and data‑use clarifications are brief; legal compliance for redistributed data is not fully specified.  \n- Evaluation relies partly on automatic scoring by GPT‑4V, which may introduce bias; more human validation would strengthen claims.  \n- Quantitative quality metrics (e.g., inter‑rater consistency, uncertainty) are limited.  \n- Some figures and tables could be condensed or moved to supplementary to improve readability.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Reproducibility and Transparency** – Please provide all code, prompts, and configuration for the data‑generation pipeline to ensure evaluators can verify annotation quality.  \n2. **Quality Control & Validation** – Expand human evaluation beyond 200 samples, report inter‑observer agreement, and discuss potential propagation of LLM hallucination or bias.  \n3. **Ethical/Data Licensing Statement** – Explicitly describe data governance (licenses of reused datasets, patient consent status, IRB considerations).  \n4. **Scientific Positioning** – Clarify the methodological core: is the novelty primarily the scalable triplet‑generation algorithm or the resultant dataset? Explicit theoretical or algorithmic framing would help position it within imaging methodology rather than data release.  \n5. **Clinical Relevance** – Discuss how multigranular annotations concretely benefit clinical imaging tasks (e.g., lesion quantification, multimodal fusion).  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct typographical inconsistencies (e.g., “LLaV A‑Tri by pretraining LLaV A” → “LLaVA‑Tri, pretrained on…”).  \n- Ensure references are consistent in style (some duplicates and capitalization issues).  \n- Improve figure legends for self‑containment, particularly Figs. 3–6.  \n- Include dataset sampling statistics by disease and modality in the main text or supplement for quick reference.  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** — The work has high potential impact as an infrastructure and methodology paper but requires stronger demonstration of data quality assurance, clearer ethical governance, and more explicit methodological framing to reach IEEE TMI standards.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n\n---\n\n**Guidance Summary**  \nTo reach TMI publishability, the authors should:  \n- Strengthen reproducibility and ethics documentation,  \n- Substantiate annotation validity with larger expert review,  \n- Emphasize methodological advances (automation framework, retrieval–generation coupling) rather than purely dataset scale.  \nWith these refinements, the paper could represent a valuable contribution to medical imaging data methodology.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a large-scale multimodal medical dataset containing over 25 million image-ROI-description triplets across 10 modalities and 65+ diseases. The authors develop an automated pipeline that generates multigranular annotations without requiring paired text descriptions, using metadata integration, ROI localization via expert models, medical knowledge retrieval, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for text generation. The resulting dataset provides structured descriptions covering five attributes: modality, organ detection, ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. To demonstrate effectiveness, they propose LLaVA-Tri, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD (81.6%), SLAKE (87.8%), and PathVQA (82.8%) benchmarks. The dataset aims to support various medical AI tasks including captioning, report generation, classification, and segmentation.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical and Technical Formulation Gaps**\n  - The paper lacks mathematical formalization of the ROI localization process and coordinate system transformations mentioned in Section 3.2.1, making reproducibility difficult\n  - No quantitative metrics are provided for the \"left-right reversal in image representation\" for X-ray and MRI modalities (Section 3.2.1, Figure 6)\n  - The vector similarity search methodology using Med-CPT encoder and Faiss indexing lacks technical specifications such as distance metrics, dimensionality, and retrieval thresholds (Section 3.2.1)\n\n• **Insufficient Evaluation Methodology**\n  - The quality evaluation relies on only 200 samples from a 25M dataset (Table 2), representing 0.0008% coverage, which may not be statistically representative\n  - Expert evaluation methodology lacks details about evaluator qualifications, inter-rater agreement, or evaluation protocols (Section 3.3)\n  - No comparison with human-generated descriptions or established medical text quality metrics beyond word count (Figure 8d)\n\n• **Dataset Construction Pipeline Reliability**\n  - Heavy dependence on metadata extraction from diverse sources (30+ datasets) without validation of metadata accuracy or consistency across sources (Section 3.2.1, Table 5)\n  - The automated ROI generation using different expert models for different modalities (Table 6) lacks cross-validation or quality assessment\n  - LLaVA-Medcap training details are relegated to appendix, yet this model generates all 25M descriptions, raising concerns about potential systematic biases\n\n• **Limited Experimental Validation**\n  - Evaluation restricted to three VQA benchmarks without testing on other medical tasks like classification, segmentation, or report generation despite claims of broad applicability (Abstract, Section 5)\n  - Ablation studies focus only on presence/absence of MedTrinity-25M pretraining without analyzing individual pipeline components' contributions\n  - No analysis of how multigranular annotations specifically contribute to performance improvements compared to simpler annotation schemes\n\n• **Scalability and Reproducibility Concerns**\n  - The pipeline's computational requirements, processing time, and resource costs for generating 25M descriptions are not reported, limiting practical adoption assessment\n  - No direct evidence found in the manuscript regarding the availability timeline or access procedures for the dataset despite public availability claims\n  - Quality control mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors in automated annotation generation are not described\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance Mathematical and Technical Documentation**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definitions for ROI coordinate transformations and localization algorithms, including pseudocode for the pipeline components\n  - Specify technical parameters for vector similarity search including distance metrics, embedding dimensions, and retrieval confidence thresholds\n  - Include detailed algorithmic descriptions of the metadata integration process with validation procedures\n\n• **Strengthen Evaluation Framework**\n  - Expand quality evaluation to at least 1000-2000 samples (0.004-0.008% of dataset) with stratified sampling across modalities and disease types\n  - Implement comprehensive inter-rater agreement studies with multiple medical experts and provide detailed evaluator qualification criteria\n  - Compare generated descriptions against human-written references using established medical text quality metrics such as medical concept coverage and clinical accuracy\n\n• **Improve Pipeline Validation and Transparency**\n  - Implement cross-validation procedures for metadata accuracy across the 30+ source datasets with systematic quality checks\n  - Provide comprehensive quality assessment of ROI generation across different expert models including precision/recall metrics\n  - Move LLaVA-Medcap training details to main paper and include systematic bias analysis of generated descriptions\n\n• **Expand Experimental Scope**\n  - Evaluate MedTrinity-25M on medical classification, segmentation, and report generation tasks beyond VQA to validate broad applicability claims\n  - Conduct detailed ablation studies analyzing individual pipeline components (metadata integration, ROI localization, knowledge retrieval) contributions\n  - Compare multigranular annotations against simpler annotation schemes to demonstrate specific value of the proposed approach\n\n• **Address Practical Implementation Issues**\n  - Report computational requirements, processing times, and estimated costs for dataset generation to enable practical adoption assessment\n  - Provide concrete dataset access procedures, file formats, and expected availability timeline with reproducibility guidelines\n  - Implement and describe quality control mechanisms for error detection and correction in the automated annotation pipeline",

The dataset is unique in its automated generation of multigranular annotations, which include both global and local information, using an ensemble of domain-specific expert models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The authors claim that MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations and supports a broad range of multimodal tasks, including captioning, report generation, and vision-centric tasks. They also propose LLaV A-Tri, a model pretrained on MedTrinity-25M, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA benchmarks.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While MedTrinity-25M represents a significant advancement in automating the generation of multigranular annotations, the novelty of the approach needs to be better contextualized within the existing literature. The authors should provide a clearer distinction between their method and recent advancements in automated medical image annotation and multimodal large language models.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation of LLaV A-Tri is conducted on three medical VQA benchmarks, but the dataset's broader applicability and generalizability remain unclear. Additional evaluations on a wider variety of datasets and tasks (e.g., segmentation, classification) would strengthen the manuscript's claims of versatility and utility.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript should include a more comprehensive comparison with other recent multimodal medical datasets and models. Current comparisons lack depth, particularly in how MedTrinity-25M's annotations compare to those of other datasets in terms of quality and utility for downstream tasks.\n\n4. Reproducibility: Although the authors mention that the dataset is publicly available, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the preprocessing pipelines, expert models used, and the specific parameters and protocols employed in generating the annotations. Providing these details is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility of the dataset and the proposed methods.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity in Descriptions: Some sections, such as the data processing pipeline, could benefit from clearer explanations. For instance, the distinction between the metadata integration and medical knowledge retrieval steps could be made more explicit.\n\n2. Consistency in Terminology: There are inconsistencies in the use of terminologies, particularly around the definition of ROIs and their roles in the annotation process. Standardizing these definitions would improve clarity.\n\n3. Figures and Tables: Figures and tables, especially those showcasing the dataset statistics and comparisons, could be enhanced for better readability and clarity.

How do you quantify hallucinations (e.g., mismatched lesion location vs. ROI, incorrect side, fabricated correlations)?\n- ROI fidelity: For datasets with segmentation masks, are masks retained alongside bounding boxes? What proportion of the 25M triplets have original masks vs. auto-generated ROIs, and what is the measured ROI accuracy (IoU/AP) on subsets with gold annotations?\n- Leakage analysis: What steps did you take to deduplicate MedTrinity-25M against VQA-RAD, SLAKE, PathVQA, and their source images? Can you share a leakage audit methodology and results?\n- Ablations: Can you quantify the contribution of each pipeline component (coarse captions, ROIs, RAG) to downstream improvements? For example, training on data generated without ROIs or without RAG and measuring VQA/open-ended performance differences?\n- 3D considerations: How do you handle redundancy and near-duplicate slices from volumetric studies? Are there heuristics to avoid oversampling near-identical slices, and do you preserve slice indices/positions for potential 3D-aware training?\n- LLaVA-Tri details: Please provide architecture specifics for the multiscale integration, pretraining schedule on the 25M (epochs, sampling, batch sizes, compute), and whether you trained on all 25M or a subset.\n- External knowledge: How do you ensure retrieved knowledge is appropriate, up-to-date, and not misleading given metadata biases? Do you filter for study type/quality and standardize terminology (e.g., ontology mapping) beyond free-text snippets?\n- Evaluation breadth: Do you plan to report results on grounding/segmentation and report-generation clinical efficacy metrics (e.g., RadGraph/ CheXpert F1), to align with the dataset’s multigranular claims?\n- Human-verified subset: Will you release a smaller, high-quality, multi-modality, expert-verified subset (with gold ROIs and textual rationales) to serve as a benchmark for factuality and localization?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper addresses a pressing need for scalable, region-aware multimodal supervision in medicine and proposes a compelling pipeline that could materially benefit the field. The dataset’s scope and the demonstrated cross-model gains on VQA tasks support its potential impact. However, given the scale and automated nature of annotation, the work would be significantly strengthened by a more rigorous quality and leakage audit, quantitative ablations isolating pipeline components, and broader evaluations beyond VQA (especially grounding/segmentation and clinical report metrics). Clarifying licensing and data release logistics is also crucial. With these issues addressed—particularly around quality control, deduplication, and reproducibility—the contribution would be a strong candidate for a top-tier venue.",

        "text": "# IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging Review Report\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of limited scale and granularity in existing medical multimodal datasets by introducing MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive dataset containing over 25 million image-ROI-description triplets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities and 65+ diseases. The authors propose an innovative automated pipeline that leverages multimodal large language models with retrieval-augmented generation to create multigranular annotations without requiring paired text descriptions. The pipeline incorporates domain-specific expert models for ROI localization and medical knowledge retrieval from authoritative sources to generate detailed descriptions covering both global information (modality, organ detection) and local information (ROI analysis, lesion texture, region-wise correlations). The authors demonstrate the value of MedTrinity-25M through LLaVA-Tri, a model pre-trained on their dataset that achieves state-of-the-art results across three medical visual question answering benchmarks (81.6% on VQA-RAD, 87.8% on SLAKE, and 82.8% on PathVQA), significantly outperforming existing approaches.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths\n- The unprecedented scale of MedTrinity-25M (25 million samples) represents a significant advancement over existing medical multimodal datasets, which typically contain orders of magnitude fewer samples.\n- The automated pipeline for generating multigranular annotations without human-labeled text is highly innovative and addresses the scalability limitations of traditional medical dataset construction.\n- The comprehensive multigranular annotation schema (covering both global and local information) provides richer context than conventional medical reports, enabling more sophisticated model training.\n- The thorough experimental validation across multiple model architectures (LLaVA-Tri, MiniCPM-V, InternVL2-8B, PubMedCLIP) consistently demonstrates performance improvements, validating the dataset's utility.\n\n### Major Limitations\n- The paper lacks sufficient discussion of potential demographic, geographic, and clinical biases in the dataset, which is critical for medical applications where representation bias can have serious clinical consequences.\n- While the retrieval-augmented approach helps, the pipeline's reliance on general-purpose LLMs introduces risks of medical misinformation that aren't adequately addressed through failure case analysis.\n- The evaluation focuses almost exclusively on VQA benchmarks without demonstrating value for clinical decision support tasks, limiting the assessment of real-world clinical relevance.\n- The description of medical knowledge integration lacks detail about how potentially conflicting information from different sources was resolved.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- Several figures (e.g., Figure 1) would benefit from more consistent labeling and formatting to enhance clarity of the comparison.\n- The paper would benefit from computational details about the dataset generation pipeline to better assess practical implementation requirements.\n- The comparison with existing datasets could be strengthened with more quantitative metrics beyond word count and sample size.\n- The clinical significance section could be expanded to better articulate how this work might translate to improved patient outcomes.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Against TMI Criteria\n\n**Significance:** The work is highly significant as it addresses a critical bottleneck in medical AI research—the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality multimodal medical datasets. The 25 million samples in MedTrinity-25M represent a substantial increase over existing resources, and the multigranular annotations provide richer information than traditional medical reports. The demonstrated improvements across multiple medical AI tasks suggest this dataset could substantially accelerate research in medical foundation models and improve model performance for clinical applications.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper introduces several innovative elements: 1) The first automated pipeline for generating multigranular medical annotations without human-labeled text, 2) The integration of medical knowledge retrieval to enhance the quality of generated descriptions, and 3) The comprehensive multigranular annotation schema that captures both global and local medical information. The approach represents a significant methodological advancement over existing approaches that rely on manually annotated reports, which inherently limit scalability.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is thorough in demonstrating performance improvements on three medical VQA benchmarks with detailed comparisons to state-of-the-art methods. The authors provide ablation studies showing consistent improvements across different model architectures. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by more comprehensive dataset quality analysis beyond the LLM and expert evaluations, additional validation on clinical tasks beyond VQA, and a more detailed analysis of failure cases and limitations of the generated annotations.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides a clear description of the dataset construction pipeline and includes example prompt templates. The authors indicate the dataset will be publicly available, which is essential for reproducibility. However, the paper would benefit from more specific implementation details, such as complete prompt templates, precise instructions for replicating the knowledge base construction, and more detailed information about the model variants and training procedures to ensure full reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThis paper represents a significant contribution to the field of medical imaging with a novel approach to large-scale dataset construction. The methodology is sound, the results are compelling, and the work addresses an important need in the medical AI community. However, before acceptance, I recommend addressing the limitations noted above, particularly expanding the discussion of potential biases in the dataset, providing more detailed information about failure cases, and enhancing the evaluation with additional clinical relevance analysis. These revisions would strengthen the paper and better position it for impact in the medical imaging community.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper\n\nThe manuscript tackles the scarcity of multigranular annotations in current medical multimodal datasets, a limitation that hinders vision‑language models from linking fine‑grained image details to broader disease contexts. To address this, the authors construct MedTrinity‑25M, a large‑scale collection comprising 25 016 845 image‑ROI‑description triplets spanning ten imaging modalities and more than 65 disease categories. Their automated pipeline first assembles coarse captions from metadata, then localizes regions of interest using either expert segmentation models or grounding networks, and finally retrieves relevant medical knowledge from a vector‑based knowledge base. These elements are integrated into prompts that drive a multimodal large language model to produce detailed, multigranular textual descriptions. The resulting dataset is used to pre‑train LLaVA‑Tri, which the authors report achieves 81.6 % accuracy on VQA‑RAD, 87.8 % on SLAKE, and 82.8 % on PathVQA. The main contribution is the release of MedTrinity‑25M together with the pipeline that enables scalable generation of multigranular visual‑textual annotations.\n\n## General feedback\n\n*Significance.*  The size (≈25 M samples) and diversity (10 modalities, >65 diseases) directly address a notable gap in large‑scale multimodal medical data and could facilitate a broad range of downstream applications.  \n\n*Innovation.*  The proposed pipeline that merges ROI‑guided, retrieval‑augmented text generation without relying on paired clinical reports is a novel element (see Fig. 2).  Nevertheless, the principal novelty lies in the dataset rather than in the modeling approach; LLaVA‑Tri’s contribution is principally the pre‑training on the new corpus.  \n\n*Evaluation.*  Performance gains are demonstrated on three VQA benchmarks (Tables 3 & 4) with modest improvements over strong baselines.  The manuscript does not present results for other claimed downstream tasks such as report generation, segmentation, or classification.

No inter‑rater agreement, disease‑level correctness analysis, or statistical significance testing is presented, which is inadequate for a corpus of this scale.  \n\n- **Ablation of pipeline components** – Qualitative comparisons with and without coarse captions, ROIs, or knowledge retrieval are shown (Figs. 3–5), but systematic ablations quantifying each component’s impact on description quality are missing.  \n\n- **Comparison to existing multimodal datasets** – Table 1 summarizes annotation types across datasets, but the manuscript does not provide empirical comparisons (e.g., training a model on MedTrinity versus MIMIC‑CXR or SAMMed‑20M) to substantiate the claimed superiority.  \n\n- **LLaVA‑Tri training specifics** – The pre‑training schedule (epochs, batch size, learning rate) on MedTrinity‑25M is not disclosed; only a brief reference to “600 K image‑text pairs from PMC‑15M” appears in Section 4.1.  \n\n- **Downstream task validation** – Despite assertions that the dataset supports report generation, classification, and segmentation, no experiments (e.g., BLEU/Rouge for report generation or standard segmentation metrics) are provided.  \n\n- **Ethical and legal considerations** – The manuscript does not discuss consent, de‑identification, or licensing for the aggregated data drawn from more than 30 public sources, which is essential for public release.  \n\n- **Accessibility of the dataset** – The placeholder URL and the lack of clear data format specifications, example scripts, or licensing information impede immediate adoption by the community.\n\n## A suggested decision\n\n**Major Revision**  \nThe work has clear potential, but substantial revisions are needed to address methodological gaps, provide fuller evaluation, and improve reproducibility and ethical reporting.",

    "abstract": "The currently leading artificial neural network models of the visual ventral stream - which are derived from a combination of performance optimization and robustification methods - have demonstrated a remarkable degree of behavioral alignment with humans on visual categorization tasks. We show that image perturbations generated by these models can enhance the ability of humans to accurately report the ground truth class. Furthermore, we find that the same models can also be used out-of-the-box to predict the proportion of correct human responses to individual images, providing a simple, human-aligned estimator of the relative difficulty of each image. Motivated by these observations, we propose to augment visual learning in humans in a way that improves human categorization accuracy at test time. Our learning augmentation approach consists of (i) selecting images based on their model-estimated recognition difficulty, and (ii) applying image perturbations that aid recognition for novice learners. We find that combining these model-based strategies leads to categorization accuracy gains of 33-72% relative to control subjects without these interventions, on unmodified, randomly selected held-out test images. Beyond the accuracy gain, the training time for the augmented learning group was also shortened by 20-23%, despite both groups completing the same number of training trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a fine-grained categorization task with natural images, as well as two tasks in clinically relevant image domains - histology and dermoscopy - where visual learning is notoriously challenging. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application of artificial neural networks to increase visual learning performance in humans by enhancing category-specific image features.",

The authors also discuss ethical implications, emphasizing the benefits of enhanced medical training and cautioning against potential biases that may arise from reliance on model-derived guidance.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The application of Robustified ANNs for improving human visual performance on image categorization seems like an interesting avenue. \n2. L-Wise empirically demonstrate gains in categorization accuracy and training efficiency. \n3. The paper addresses ethics concerns. Since the work mentions use of clinical data ethics discussion is of critical importance.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The paper focused on the performance of ventral stream. But we know that the human visual stream has a dorsal stream (where) that locates an object and the ventral stream (what) stream. And the interplay of these two streams forms the basis of human visual system. In this work the authors mainly focused on the ventral stream. From only quantified data, we can see the gains but it is very hard to trace this back to the nuanced perturbations the ANN produces. Hence, the suggestion is to use human gaze. The human gaze will precisely pin-point the \"where\" aspect and then will truly help us understand if at all the model perturbations are helping improve human performance. Can the authors please explain this? \n2. A robust DNN actually has worse performance on nominal data points. Data points that have not been corrupted adversarially. What was the motivation of the authors to select such a model for their experiments? \n3. The perturbations -  The perturbations if I am not mistaken are very subtle ones. For fine grained classifications, humans do follow curriculum learning but learning structures gradually from simpler to harder concepts. No experiments have shown this. It would be great if the authors can provide some empirical results/ explanation that can explain how will their method occur when you focus on structural cues rather than model perturbations that will benefit fine grained categorization. \n4. I am providing some citations related to Gaze and dual stream hypothesis that can help authors clarify my concerns \n\na.

Literature related to papers accepted in NeurIPS Gaze Meets ML workshop. That workshop accepted papers will provide intuition of how human gaze can be used in coherence with DL models.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. For model perturbations, can the authors please provide heat maps or any qualitative results that will help us track the ANN perturbations to human visual learning? \n2. Is there a way to show if the study scales/generalizes to other ANNs as well other than Adversarially trained ones? Since human subjects have been used here, I am not sure how feasible experiments will be. This can be a general neural network or a network trained by the CutMix [a] loss that provides robustness benefits as well. \n3. I feel generating perturbations based of dual stream networks and then using human gaze to track these will be a much stronger claim to the work. Can the authors please address this question? \n4. What about adversarially trained transformers? The attention maps are different from CNN feature maps. How will the study be applicable for perturbations based of a transformer backbone? \n5.

The authors also discuss ethical considerations, highlighting both the potential benefits for medical training and the risks of bias arising from model-guided human learning. The paper is generally clear, though the rationale and scope of experiments could be more thoroughly justified.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Human Visual Processing and Model Interpretation:** The study focuses primarily on the ventral stream (“what” pathway) of human vision, overlooking the dorsal stream (“where” pathway) and their interaction. Since human visual recognition depends on both, the reviewer suggests incorporating **human gaze data** to clarify how ANN perturbations influence perceptual processes and to substantiate claims about improved human performance.  \n2. **Choice of Robust Models:** Adversarially trained networks are known to perform worse on nominal (non-perturbed) data. The rationale for using such models as the foundation for human teaching experiments needs clearer motivation.  \n3. **Perturbation Design and Learning Structure:** The perturbations appear very subtle. Given that humans typically learn through curriculum-like progression from simple to complex stimuli, empirical or theoretical justification is needed for how structural cues or perturbations benefit fine-grained categorization.  \n4. **Generality and Comparison:** The reviewer requests clarification on whether the approach generalizes beyond adversarially trained models—e.g., to standard ANNs or networks trained with regularization methods like CutMix—and whether results might differ using transformer architectures with attention maps.  \n5. **Qualitative Analysis:** Including visualizations such as heatmaps could help trace model perturbations and relate them to human learning patterns.  \n6. **Supporting Literature:** The reviewer points to works on dual-stream vision (e.g., *Dual-Stream Neural Network*, NeurIPS 2023) and research from the *Gaze Meets ML* workshop as valuable for addressing the interplay of gaze and deep learning.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify the motivation for robustness-based training in non-adversarial contexts.  \n- Ensure proper citation of referenced works (e.g., CutMix, NeurIPS 2023, workshop papers).  \n- Further details on ethical data handling would strengthen the responsible research section.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful framework linking human learning and robust machine vision models.

First, the authors select images to present to novice learners based on a model’s estimated recognition difficulty for each image. Next, they apply image perturbations intended to aid recognition for novice learners. The authors conduct experiment on the three benchmark datasets, including the natural image and the clinical image to verify the effectiveness of their proposal.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. This paper is well-motivated, and a decent amount of technical details are given.\n2. The idea of improving the categorization performance of the novice learner by leveraging the capacity of the robustified artificial neural network is both interesting and practical.\n3. The reported improvement in novice learners' performance is notable, with gains in both test accuracy and reduced training time.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The establishment of the empirical observations is somewhat unconvincing. Do these observations hold in more complex classification tasks or when applied to medical imaging?\n2. The related work section lacks discussion of both the machine teaching and human-machine vision alignment methods.\n3. The size of the particants is somewhat small. \n4. The perception of enhanced images may be altered due to perturbations.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. The empirical observations are derived from a 16-way animal categorization task on natural images, which seems somewhat simplistic. It would be valuable to examine how these observations hold up in more complex categorization tasks or with different types of images, especially medical images. Given the typically limited availability of medical images, the proposed method could have promising applications in the medical imaging field.\n\n2. Beyond the empirical observations, is there any physiological insight or analysis on why the proposed model-based selection and enhancement method could improve novice learners’ performance in categorization tasks?\n\n3. The authors do not discuss the related machine teaching literature. An in-depth comparison with machine teaching methods, particularly with \"Teaching Categories to Human Learners with Visual Explanations\" (CVPR 2018), would be valuable. This work similarly considers image difficulty; an introduction and comparison with it are beneficial.\n\n4. The authors should also discuss the connection to human-machine vision alignment methods, such as \"Harmonizing the Object Recognition Strategies of Deep Neural Networks with Humans\" (NeurIPS 2022).\n\n5. The sample size of participants is relatively small, and expanding the participant pool is recommended to enhance the reliability of the results; also, recruiting participants from diverse backgrounds would improve the generalizability of the findings. If expanding the participant pool is impractical due to time or budget constraints, performing a power analysis or discussing effect sizes could help strengthen the reliability of the analysis.\n\n6. When using perturbations to enhance images, how does the method ensure that essential image details remain unchanged, particularly when using a large ϵ (e.g., 20)? This concern is especially pertinent for medical images, where even slight pixel changes may alter critical information. I recommend involving medical experts to review the enhanced images or using quantitative similarity measures (such as SSIM or FSIM) to verify that essential details are preserved.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 3",

These goals fall closer to human–machine interaction or cognitive vision than to core TMI topics (e.g., image formation, quantitative biomarkers, or clinical imaging pipelines). The contribution is therefore *marginally relevant* to TMI’s methodological orientation.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level – Moderate**  \n   The concept of using robustified ANNs to both estimate human recognition difficulty and generate category‑specific perturbations to aid learning is novel in the context of perceptual augmentation. The combination of difficulty‑weighted image selection and enhancement (“L‑WISE”) is an original integration. However, within medical imaging, the methodological novelty is indirect: the work shows utility of an existing robust adversarial training framework rather than introducing a new imaging algorithm.  \n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor – Generally strong, with caveats**  \n   • Clear explanation of model training, datasets (HAM10000, MHIST, moth data), and subject recruitment.  \n   • Multiple ablation and cross‑domain validations reinforce internal consistency.  \n   • The human‑subject experiments are well powered for behavioral analysis, not for clinical validation.  \n   • No quantitative evaluation against radiologist performance or diagnostic endpoints—hence limited medical imaging rigor.  \n   • Statistical treatment (χ² tests, bootstrapped CIs, logistic regressions) is appropriate.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation – Excellent**  \n   Manuscript is well structured, well illustrated, and grammatically polished. Figures are clear and annotated; methods and appendices provide reproducibility details.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance – Adequate**  \n   IRB approval, informed consent, fair participant compensation, and code availability are indicated. The authors discuss dataset biases (e.g., skin‑tone imbalance in HAM10000) responsibly.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \n   The authors propose *Logit‑Weighted Image Selection and Enhancement* (L‑WISE), a model‑based method to accelerate and improve human visual category learning. Using adversarially trained (“robustified”) neural networks, they (a) predict each image’s recognition difficulty for humans from the ground‑truth logit output, and (b) apply pixel‑bounded perturbations that highlight class‑specific features. These signals define an adaptive curriculum of progressively harder images and fading enhancement strength. Human participants trained with L‑WISE attained 33–72 % higher test‑phase accuracy and ~20 % shorter training duration across natural, dermoscopy, and histology images.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n   • Creative cross‑disciplinary idea linking adversarial robustness to human perceptual learning.  \n   • Extensive behavioral validation with >500 participants.  \n   • Strong statistical analysis and reproducibility documentation.  \n   • Ethical and bias awareness sections are exemplary.  \n   • Potential relevance for educational tools in pathology and dermatology training.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n   • The methodological innovation pertains to **human learning augmentation**, not directly to **medical imaging methodology** as defined by TMI.  \n   • The medical tasks used are illustrative small‑scale classification problems; no evidence of translation to clinical diagnostic improvement.  \n   • Enhancement mechanism is largely heuristic—no formal modeling of perceptual or imaging physics.  \n   • The perturbations may distort image realism; risk of misleading visual cues is insufficiently quantified.  \n   • Sparse comparison with existing curriculum‑learning or active‑learning frameworks in medical imaging.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n   1. **Clarify TMI relevance.** The paper should explicitly discuss how L‑WISE contributes to *medical imaging science* beyond cognitive training—for instance, could similar methodology optimize annotation, reader training, or quality control in radiology workflows?  \n   2. **Quantify perturbation realism.** Provide perceptual or image‑quality metrics (e.g., SSIM, color fidelity) on medical data to ensure that enhancements do not produce artificial or non‑physiologic appearances.  \n   3. **Ablation within clinical tasks.** The ablation study is mainly on natural or dermoscopy data; it would strengthen the translational argument to repeat at least one ablation in histology.  \n   4. **Statistical generalization.** Randomization and participant pooling across experiments should be formalized—report per‑subject variance and number of images per condition.  \n   5. **Potential biases.** Include quantitative assessment of whether perturbations exacerbate known dataset biases (e.g., skin tone).  \n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n   • Correct occasional typographical issues (“robustu‑fied”, “precariousness”).  \n   • Provide actual number of images per class and dataset partition in main text rather than only in appendix.  \n   • Clarify computational cost for generating perturbations and whether code supports GPU inference.  \n   • Suggest renaming sections on “histology—malignant vs benign” to specify true class labels (hyperplastic polyp vs sessile serrated adenoma).  \n   • Ensure all figures use consistent font sizes and color legends.\n\n6. **Overall Recommendation** – **Reject (Out of Scope / Low Novelty for TMI)**  \n   The study is methodologically careful and creative, but its primary focus—augmenting human visual learning via robustified networks—is outside the central scope of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, which prioritizes new imaging or analytic methodologies rather than cognitive‑training paradigms. A venue emphasizing human–AI interaction, neuro‑inspired vision, or medical education technology (e.g., *IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems* or *Frontiers in Digital Health*) would be a better fit.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n   High confidence in assessment of scientific quality and scope alignment; moderate uncertainty about editorial policy boundaries.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nInnovative and well‑executed behavioral research with interesting implications for visual training, but its contributions lie more in human–machine perceptual alignment than in the methodological advancement of medical imaging. Recommend rejection for TMI due to limited scope fit, while encouraging submission to a journal focused on human–AI perception or educational applications.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents L-WISE (Logit-Weighted Image Selection and Enhancement), a method that uses robustified artificial neural networks to augment human visual category learning. The authors establish that ground truth logit values from adversarially-trained models can predict human image recognition difficulty (Figure 1A) and that perturbations maximizing these logits enhance human categorization accuracy (Figure 1B). L-WISE combines two strategies: (1) selecting training images based on model-estimated difficulty with gradually increasing complexity, and (2) applying image enhancements that decrease over time (Figure 2). The method was tested across three domains: moth species classification, dermoscopy lesion classification, and histology tissue classification. Results show 33-72% relative accuracy gains above chance on unmodified test images compared to controls, while reducing training time by 20-23% (Figure 4A). Ablation studies indicate both image selection and enhancement contribute to performance improvements (Table 1).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Limited Mathematical Foundation for Enhancement Optimization** \n  - Equation 1 lacks theoretical justification for the choice of α parameter and its relationship to enhancement effectiveness, with α set to different values (0 for ImageNet, 1 for fine-grained tasks) without principled reasoning\n  - The projection operation in Equation 2 uses a simple L2 constraint but no analysis is provided on why this norm is optimal for human perception compared to other constraint formulations\n  - The step size η and number of steps formula (ceil(2ϵ) for ResNet-50, ceil(4ϵ) for XCiT) appear ad-hoc without convergence analysis or theoretical grounding (Page 10, Appendix S1)\n\n• **Insufficient Statistical Power and Multiple Comparisons Control**\n  - Sample sizes of ~30 participants per condition (Page 10) may be inadequate for detecting meaningful effect sizes, particularly for class-specific analyses where the authors acknowledge being \"statistically underpowered\" (Page 26)\n  - No correction for multiple comparisons is applied across the numerous statistical tests performed, including comparisons between conditions in Table 1 and across different image domains\n  - The logistic regression analysis in Figure 1A pools data from different experimental conditions without accounting for potential confounding factors or participant-level random effects\n\n• **Questionable Generalizability of Enhancement Schedules**\n  - The enhancement schedules (exponential tapering from ε=8, difficulty selection increasing by 0.15 per block) were not optimized systematically and appear to be based on limited pilot testing (Page 10, Figure S12H-M)\n  - No evidence provided that the fixed schedules work across different participant populations, learning rates, or task complexities beyond the three tested domains\n  - The authors acknowledge not conducting \"exhaustive search for optimal curriculum design strategies\" (Page 9) but provide no framework for how practitioners could adapt these schedules to new domains\n\n• **Methodological Concerns in Human Experiments**\n  - The 17ms presentation time for ImageNet animal classification (Page 10) is extremely brief and may not reflect natural viewing conditions, potentially limiting ecological validity\n  - Assignment of Greek mythology aliases to categories (Page 10) introduces an additional layer of abstraction that may not generalize to real-world learning scenarios where meaningful category names are available\n  - Dropout analysis (Appendix S9) suggests systematic differences between groups that could indicate selection bias, with control participants withdrawing at significantly higher rates\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen Mathematical Framework for Enhancement**\n  - Provide theoretical analysis or empirical justification for the choice of α parameter in Equation 1, including systematic evaluation across different α values to determine optimal weighting\n  - Compare L2 projection constraints against other norms (L∞, L1) and provide principled guidelines for selecting constraint types based on image domain characteristics\n  - Develop convergence criteria and theoretical bounds for the optimization procedure in Equation 2, replacing ad-hoc step size formulas with principled optimization schedules\n\n• **Improve Statistical Rigor and Power Analysis**\n  - Conduct proper power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes for detecting meaningful effects, particularly for class-specific comparisons mentioned in Table S1\n  - Apply appropriate multiple comparisons corrections (Bonferroni, FDR) across all statistical tests and clearly report adjusted p-values\n  - Implement mixed-effects models that account for participant-level variability and potential confounding factors in the pooled analyses shown in Figure 1A\n\n• **Develop Systematic Schedule Optimization Framework**\n  - Implement systematic hyperparameter optimization (grid search, Bayesian optimization) for enhancement and difficulty selection schedules across different domains\n  - Provide adaptive scheduling algorithms that adjust enhancement and difficulty parameters based on individual learner performance during training\n  - Establish guidelines or decision trees for practitioners to customize schedules based on domain characteristics, task complexity, and target population\n\n• **Enhance Experimental Methodology and Controls**\n  - Test multiple presentation durations for image classification tasks to establish the robustness of findings across realistic viewing conditions\n  - Include conditions with meaningful category names alongside Greek aliases to assess the impact of semantic knowledge on learning outcomes\n  - Implement balanced randomization procedures and intention-to-treat analyses to address potential selection bias indicated by differential dropout rates across conditions",

        "text": "## L-WISE: Boosting Human Visual Category Learning Through Model-Based Image Selection and Enhancement\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes L-WISE, a model-based curriculum for human visual category learning that combines two components derived from robustified ANNs: (i) using the ground-truth logit to predict image difficulty for humans and select training examples on an easy-to-hard schedule, and (ii) applying pixel-space perturbations that maximize the ground-truth logit to enhance category-relevant features, with enhancement tapered over time. Across three domains (fine-grained moth species, dermoscopy, histology), L-WISE improves test accuracy on unmodified, randomly sampled held-out images by 33–72% over controls (relative to chance margin) while reducing training time by ~20–23%, and the difficulty predictor achieves AUC ~0.72 on a 16-way basic animal task.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationUses adversarially trained (robustified) models’ ground-truth logits as an actionable, human-aligned difficulty score for curriculum design, and leverages perceptually aligned gradients for category-specific enhancement aimed at helping humans (rather than fooling models).The idea of tapering enhancement while increasing difficulty is a simple, principled, and model-agnostic schedule that is likely to generalize.Clear separation between model-guided enhancement and human evaluation on unmodified test images mitigates concerns about learning artifacts unique to perturbed images.\n- Experimental rigor and validationMultiple image domains (natural fine-grained, dermoscopy, histology) with consistent improvements and statistical testing;

risks of dataset-induced biases are acknowledged but not systematically quantified.The number of classes in the learning tasks is small (2–4), leaving open whether gains persist in higher-cardinality, more ecologically complex settings.The enhancement objective sometimes includes minimizing non-target logits (α=1); this could suppress shared features in multi-class settings in non-obvious ways and might introduce artifacts.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesThe “state-of-the-art” difficulty prediction claim relies on an AUC comparison to prior methods reported in the appendix; a main-text quantitative comparison (with identical data splits) would strengthen the claim.The ablation finding that DS (shuffled) ≥ DS suggests that ordering may be less critical than distributional easing, but the paper does not fully analyze why, nor quantify the respective contributions using a unified model (e.g., mixed-effects modeling of trial difficulty, order, and enhancement).No explicit controls to rule out class-specific “watermarking” or low-level artifact learning (e.g., matched-norm sham perturbations that preserve power spectrum but are label-agnostic).Difficulty-prediction performance is shown on the 16-way animal task; analogous predictive evaluation is not reported for the dermoscopy and histology datasets, despite using logits to schedule curricula there.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSome statistical details are brief (e.g., effect sizes in absolute terms, multiple comparison corrections, power analyses); reliance on “relative to chance margin” can overstate perceived improvements.Limited detail in the main text about PGD settings, clipping, color management, and display timing fidelity (web-based 17 ms exposures) leaves potential reproducibility or interpretability questions.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsA direct empirical comparison to educational baselines that highlight where to look (e.g., EXPLAIN, CAM/bounding-box overlays) would contextualize the added value of implicit, model-crafted pixel perturbations.Additional alignment literature (e.g., off-/on-manifold robustness equivalence and PAG mechanisms) could be more tightly integrated into the narrative motivating why logits and gradients should help human learning.\n\n- Enhancement via logit maximization can homogenize class appearances and potentially bias learners toward a subset of within-class features;

If not, can you report these to justify the use of logit-based schedules in those domains?\n- Artifact controls: Did you try label-agnostic or class-mismatched perturbations with matched L2 norms during training to check whether any “watermark-like” artifacts drive learning? Similarly, did you test enhancement using non-robust models (or robust models trained on a different dataset) to probe specificity?\n- Enhancement objective: How sensitive are results to the α parameter in Eq. (1) and to PGD hyperparameters (step size/steps, initialization, clipping, color gamut)? Any qualitative differences between α=0 vs α=1 in terms of homogenization?\n- Curriculum ordering: Given DS (shuffled) ≥ DS, can you provide a trial-level mixed-effects analysis to disentangle the effects of ordering from distributional easing and enhancement magnitude? Do you observe interactions between difficulty and enhancement?\n- Reaction times and speed–accuracy: Can you report RT distributions by condition and correctness, and analyze whether reduced training duration reflects a beneficial shift (faster and more accurate) rather than a speed–accuracy trade-off?\n- Generalization to higher cardinality: Have you piloted L-WISE on tasks with more classes (e.g., 8–16-way fine-grained), and do gains scale? Any evidence of diminishing returns with increasing class count?\n- Baselines with explicit guidance: How would L-WISE compare to CAM/bounding-box highlighting (EXPLAIN-style) or hybrid methods (explicit where + implicit what)? Could you include such a baseline in a follow-up?\n- Individualization: Did you attempt adaptive schedules based on ongoing learner performance (accuracy/RT)? If not, what obstacles did you face, and do you expect larger effects with closed-loop adaptation?\n- Cross-model robustness: If enhancement is generated by one robust model and difficulty is scored by another robust model (or a robust ViT), do you retain learning benefits and difficulty prediction accuracy?\n- Statistical reporting: Can you provide absolute accuracy improvements, standardized effect sizes, and multiple-comparison adjustments for the main hypothesis tests?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is a timely and creative paper that moves beyond model–human alignment metrics to demonstrate a tangible application: using robustified ANNs to accelerate and improve human visual category learning. The methodology is conceptually sound, the experiments are well-motivated and diversified across domains, and the inclusion of ablations adds credibility. While several aspects would benefit from deeper analysis—particularly artifact controls, comprehensive difficulty-prediction validation in clinical tasks, refined statistics, and stronger baselines with explicit visual guidance—the work presents a compelling proof-of-concept with clear scientific and practical significance. With additional controls and expanded comparisons, this paper has strong potential for publication at a top-tier venue and for catalyzing follow-up research on personalized, model-informed curricula for human learning.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces **L‑WISE**, a model‑based curriculum framework for human visual category learning. It leverages robustified neural networks to (i) predict human image difficulty via ground‑truth logits and (ii) generate pixel‑space enhancements that amplify category‑relevant features, with modifications tapered over training. Tested across moth species, dermoscopy, and histology domains, L‑WISE reportedly improves human test accuracy by 33–72% (relative to chance margin) and reduces training time by roughly 20%. The paper is clearly written, methodologically detailed, and positions its contributions within both machine‑learning and cognitive‑training research.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Technical limitations.** Enhancement via logit maximization may homogenize class appearances and bias learners toward a limited feature subset; dataset‑induced biases are acknowledged but not quantified. The small number of training classes (2–4) limits generalizability, and minimizing non‑target logits (α = 1) could inadvertently suppress shared features in multi‑class settings.  \n2. **Evaluation gaps.** The claim of state‑of‑the‑art difficulty prediction relies on appendix‑level comparisons; direct quantitative main‑text results would strengthen it. The ablation showing DS(shuffled) ≥ DS raises unresolved questions about the relative roles of ordering versus distributional easing. Controls for class‑specific artifacts or watermarking and predictive‑model validation on dermoscopy and histology data are missing.  \n3. **Statistical and methodological detail.** More explicit reporting of absolute accuracy gains, standardized effect sizes, and multiple‑comparison corrections would clarify effect magnitude. Insufficient detail about PGD parameters, color management, and display timing may hinder reproducibility.  \n4. **Related work and baselines.** Direct human‑study comparisons with educational or region‑highlighting baselines (e.g., EXPLAIN) and greater integration with alignment literature (robustness vs. perceptual alignment) would provide stronger context.  \n5. **Experimental analysis.** The reviewer suggests additional ablations on α, factorial designs to separate enhancement, selection, and ordering effects, and inclusion of calibration curves or mixed‑effects models to assess robustness of the difficulty predictor. Reaction‑time analyses could test potential speed–accuracy trade‑offs.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Figures and curriculum schematics are clear; ensuring full confusion matrices and PGD hyperparameter details in the appendix would aid reproducibility.  \n- Clarify terminology such as “relative to chance margin.”  \n- Confirm consistency of statistical testing, AUC computation, and domain‑specific evaluation.  \n- Minor editorial issues: ensure uniform notation for ε and α parameters, and define all acronyms at first use.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, this is a technically sound and innovative study that demonstrates how robustified networks can guide **human learning** rather than merely interpret it. The approach is conceptually strong, experimentally diversified, and complemented by thoughtful discussion of ethics and limitations. Main weaknesses lie in incomplete statistical transparency, limited artifact controls, and a need for more direct comparative baselines. Addressing these analytic and reporting issues would substantively reinforce the paper’s claims and broaden its applicability.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major revision.** The work is promising and potentially impactful but requires stronger empirical validation, expanded analyses, and fuller reporting before acceptance.",

        "text": "# Review Report for IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThe paper addresses the critical challenge of improving human visual learning for complex image categorization tasks, particularly in medical imaging domains where experts require extensive training to achieve proficiency. The authors propose L-WISE (Logit-Weighted Image Selection and Enhancement), a novel approach that leverages robustified artificial neural networks (ANNs) to both predict image recognition difficulty and generate targeted image perturbations that enhance category perception for human learners. The method combines two key components: (1) selecting images based on model-predicted recognition difficulty to create an adaptive curriculum that begins with \"easier\" images and gradually increases difficulty, and (2) applying pixel-level perturbations that maximize ground truth logit activation to make images more discriminable. The authors demonstrate that L-WISE significantly improves test-time accuracy (33-72% relative gains) and reduces training time (20-23%) across three diverse image domains: fine-grained moth classification, dermoscopy skin lesion classification, and histology image classification. Notably, the most substantial improvements were observed in the clinically relevant dermoscopy task, suggesting practical value for medical education.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The work represents a significant conceptual advance by applying robustified ANNs not just to improve model performance but to directly enhance human visual learning—a novel direction in the field.\n- The experimental validation across three distinct domains, including two clinically relevant medical imaging tasks, provides strong evidence of the approach's generalizability.\n- The comprehensive ablation study (Table 1) clearly demonstrates the relative contributions of image enhancement versus difficulty-based selection, showing both components provide meaningful benefits.\n- The human-subject experimental design is rigorous, with appropriate control conditions, sufficient statistical power, and thoughtful attention to potential confounding variables (e.g., randomized category naming).\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper insufficiently addresses potential safety concerns when applying this to medical diagnostics, particularly the risk that enhanced images might teach learners to focus on features that aren't clinically relevant or that enhancement might create \"hallucinations\" that could lead to misdiagnosis in real-world settings.\n- While the authors acknowledge the homogenizing effect of logit maximization (Section 5.1), they don't provide concrete mitigation strategies to prevent the loss of important heterogeneity in medical image features that might be clinically significant.\n- The clinical applicability is currently limited as the approach was only tested with non-clinicians in controlled settings; testing with actual medical trainees would strengthen the medical relevance.\n- The mechanism behind why image enhancement works isn't thoroughly explored—does it highlight real diagnostic features or create artificial ones? The discussion of \"hallucinations\" (Appendix S10) acknowledges this concern but doesn't provide sufficient investigation.\n\n### Minor Comments:\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The visualizations are exceptionally clear and effectively demonstrate the method's effects across multiple domains.\n- The paper is well-structured with a logical flow from problem statement to methodology to results.\n- The comparison with off-the-shelf enhancement methods (Figure 1B) provides compelling evidence that conventional approaches don't yield similar benefits.\n- The ethical considerations section thoughtfully addresses potential risks, particularly regarding bias in medical applications.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- More detailed explanation of how the \"shuffled\" conditions in Table 1 were implemented would improve reproducibility.\n- Some figures (e.g., Figure S12) could benefit from more detailed captions explaining the differences between the pilot and main experiments.\n- The relationship between enhancement magnitude (ε) and accuracy could be explored more systematically across different image difficulty levels.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Along TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance:** The work has high significance for medical imaging as it addresses the critical need to improve training efficiency for medical image interpretation. The demonstrated improvements in learning speed and accuracy could translate to substantial time savings in medical education while potentially improving diagnostic accuracy. The successful application to dermoscopy and histology—two domains where visual expertise is essential but difficult to acquire—makes this particularly relevant to the TMI audience.\n\n**Innovation:** The approach is highly innovative in applying robustified ANNs to enhance human learning rather than just model performance. While individual components have been studied previously, their integration into a learning curriculum for humans represents a novel conceptual advance with strong practical implications. The work bridges computational neuroscience, machine learning, and medical education in a meaningful way.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is thorough and well-designed. The authors conducted rigorous human-subject experiments with appropriate controls, statistical analysis, and sufficient power across multiple domains. The ablation studies help isolate the contributions of different components, and the comparison with conventional image enhancement methods strengthens the claims. However, evaluation with actual medical trainees rather than general participants would have strengthened the clinical relevance.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides extensive methodological details in both the main text and appendices. The reproducibility statement indicates comprehensive sharing of code and experimental frameworks, which should facilitate replication. The detailed description of the enhancement algorithm (Appendix S1) and the inclusion of all hyperparameters for training robustified networks are particularly helpful for reproduction.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThe paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of medical image analysis by demonstrating a novel application of robustified ANNs to improve human learning. The methodology is sound, the evaluation is thorough, and the potential clinical applications are promising. However, I recommend minor revisions to address the safety concerns more thoroughly and to provide additional insight into the mechanism by which image enhancement aids learning. Specifically, the authors should:\n1) Expand the discussion of clinical safety considerations with concrete suggestions for mitigating potential risks\n2) Provide more detailed analysis of whether enhancements highlight real diagnostic features or create artificial ones\n3) Clarify the implementation details of the \"shuffled\" conditions in Table 1\n\nThese revisions would strengthen the paper's clinical relevance and ensure responsible development of this promising approach. With these modifications, this work would be an excellent addition to TMI.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe authors examine whether robustly trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) that emulate ventral‑stream processing can be leveraged to accelerate human visual category learning. Participants classified images in three medically relevant domains—fine‑grained moth species, dermoscopic skin lesions, and colon histology. The proposed L‑WISE curriculum combines (i) a difficulty estimate derived from the ground‑truth logit of a robustified ANN and (ii) pixel‑level perturbations that maximize that logit, thereby amplifying task‑relevant features. Across the three tasks, L‑WISE purportedly raises test accuracy by 33–72 % and cuts training time by 20–23 % while using an identical number of trials. The central claim is that a model‑driven curriculum can predict image difficulty and generate perceptual enhancements that speed human visual learning.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:** The manuscript tackles an under‑explored junction between adversarially trained vision models and human learning, a topic that could bear on medical education and clinician training.  \n- **Innovation:** Melding a logit‑based difficulty estimator with model‑driven image enhancement is an original idea, even though curriculum learning and adversarial perturbations have each been investigated separately.  \n- **Evaluation:** The human experiments are extensive and report statistically significant effects (χ², *p* < 0.001). Gains are displayed for all three domains (Fig. 4A) and reductions in training time are quantified (Table 1). Nevertheless, the authors compare L‑WISE only against a naïve control. Established curriculum‑learning schemes or saliency‑highlighting approaches are absent as baselines, and the paper provides no power analysis or effect‑size metrics beyond confidence intervals.  \n- **Reproducibility:** The authors state that code and hyper‑parameters will be released and include a reproducibility statement. Yet the main text omits crucial details about the adversarial training (e.g., attack type, ε budget schedule per task) and the participant randomisation procedure, which limits the ability of an independent group to replicate the study fully.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n- **Normalization of the difficulty metric:** The ground‑truth logit is employed as a difficulty score (Fig. 1A), but the manuscript does not clarify how logits are normalized across classes or datasets. Without this information it is unclear whether difficulty scores are comparable between tasks.  \n- **Baseline image‑enhancement comparison:** The authors claim that conventional methods (CLAHE, MSRCR, Lightroom “Auto”) are ineffective (Fig. 1B) but present no quantitative effect sizes or statistical testing. Moreover, the parameter settings used for these baselines are not described, raising doubts about the fairness of the comparison.  \n- **Justification of the curriculum schedule:** The linear increase in maximal difficulty and the exponential decay of ε (Fig. 2E‑F) appear to be chosen heuristically. The manuscript lacks any hyper‑parameter sweep or sensitivity analysis, leaving open the possibility that the reported gains depend on these particular schedules.  \n- **Statistical rigor of ablations:** Table 1 lists mean accuracies and training durations with 95 % confidence intervals, yet it does not provide pairwise significance tests (e.g., post‑hoc *p*‑values) for each ablated condition versus the control. This omission weakens the claim of a “significant additive benefit.”  \n- **Bias analysis in the clinical domains:** Section 5.1 mentions a potential skin‑tone bias in the dermoscopy task, but the authors do not empirically examine whether the logit‑maximizing perturbations mitigate or exacerbate class imbalances (see Fig. S12H). Such an analysis is essential before considering clinical deployment.  \n- **Participant demographics and attention checks:** The ethics statement refers to a demographic breakdown (Table S2) that is not included in the manuscript. Without these data it is difficult to assess sample diversity, prior experience with medical images, or the effectiveness of attention‑check procedures.  \n- **Generalization to novel categories:** Test images are unmodified but drawn from the same set of classes used during training. The study does not explore whether L‑WISE improves transfer to unseen categories or out‑of‑distribution samples, limiting the scope of the authors’ generalizability claim.  \n- **Comparison with existing difficulty metrics:** Figure 1A shows that the logit‑based estimator outperforms the metric of Mayo et al. (2023), yet no statistical test (e.g., DeLong comparison) is reported, and other plausible baselines are omitted. Consequently, the improvement remains only marginally substantiated.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision** – The manuscript currently lacks essential baseline comparisons, thorough statistical analyses, and detailed methodological information, which together prevent a reliable assessment of the claimed improvements. Addressing these gaps is necessary before the work can be considered for publication.",

The proposed method leveraged the diffusion modeling concept, but instead of training a diffusion model with “clean images” as x_0 and noise as x_T, it utilized two diffusion weighted images (DWIs) with different diffusion encodings at both ends of a “diffusion-like” process. A denoising network was trained by predicting one DWI using a linear combination of two DWIs and an added noise term. The linear combination coefficients are time-dependent and determined via a scheduling strategy similar to training a diffusion model. The network was then used for a conditional sampling step for generating the final denoised images. The idea to utilize images acquired with different diffusion encodings to denoise one of them is interesting and the training strategy is an interesting approach to leverage the diffusion modeling concept, especially with training only latter diffusion steps to reduce hallucinations. However, several key assumptions made are questionable and the overall methodology and presentation lacks clarity. Evaluation using only dMRI signal model goodness of fit is limited and can be biased. There are a few overstatements that can mislead the readers. Detailed comments can be found below.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nA diffusion-like modeling that learns the relationship between two DWI volumes with different diffusion encodings to denoise one or each other.\n\nTraining only later step diffusion to avoid hallucination\n\nA fusion strategy that exploits linear combination of two DWIs with different contrasts with time-dependent coefficients and iterative refinement.\n\nExtensive evaluations using both simulations that exactly followed the assumptions for the proposed methodology and practical magnitude DWI data.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThere are statements that can be misleading in the context of MR physics (aka domain knowledge). For example, \"the noise predominantly originates from physical interferences (Fadnavis et al., 2020a)\". This statement about physical interferences is  both vague and inaccurate. This work is dealing with thermal noise or noise resulting from thermal noise in the measurements, which is not really physical interferences depending on how ones interpret them. Another example, \"Different clinical applications require varying numbers of diffusion vectors and acquisition strategies, which makes modeling the noise distribution and further implementing denoising techniques challenging\". Acquiring DWIs with varying numbers of diffusion vectors had nothing to do with the difficulty of  modeling noise distribution.\n\nMany key assumptions for the proposed method was built on do not hold which made the theoretical/mathematical foundations questionable, e.g.,\na) It seems that the authors assumed DWIs acquired with different diffusion encodings had the same underlying “clean” image and were corrupted by independent noise. This is inaccurate. In fact, two DWIs can have rather different contrasts due to the diffusion encoding effects, e.g., different diffusion encoding directions. More specifically, x and x’ cannot be simply modeled as the same y plus different noise. What are the implications of this assumption not met?\n\nb) Line 111: The authors claimed that that the proposed method does not require an explicit noise model. This is an overstatement. The J-invariance assumption, which formed the basis of the training objective in Eq. (9) implicitly requires that the noise distribution be zero-means and conditionally independent. Furthermore, additive noise model was assumed, x = y + n1 (Line 200). In dMRI, the magnitude images with higher b-values (stronger diffusion weightings) can have lower SNR for which additive noise may not hold. These need to be clarified.\n\n-  Overall, the presentation lacks clarity and there seem to be some concerning inaccuracies.\na) The linear combination relationship claimed in Section 3.1 does not seem accurate. I checked the derivation. Eq. 31 is correct which is known (so this is not a contribution of the authors), but I'm not sure about going from Eq. 31 to 32 as F_theta predicts x_0, but they are not equal, and there is also an additional term of sigma_t^2*z. Therefore, I don't think it's a correct statement to say x_(t-1) is a linear interpolation between x_out and x_t. But is this really needed for the proposed method? I really don’t see a connection between what’s argued theoretically and what’s actually being implemented.\n\nb) There are a few other inaccurate mathematical statements and notations which are confusing. For example, Eq. 7, the left side has q(x1:T |xt*) which is a joint distribution for x1 to xT, and the right side is a Gaussian distribution for xt. \nOn Line 160: {xt}1:T was described as”obtained from the reverse process.” However, in\nFigure 1 and on the right side of Equation (7) on Line 186, it appears that xt is a corrupted version of xt*.  This interpretation, along with the notation in the Fig. 1, implies that {xt}1:T would represent a forward process. It appears to this reviewer the authors had not been using a consistent definition of forward and reverse diffusion which made the overall description rather confusing. These are just examples of inconsistencies found.\n\nc) According to the J-invariance property, the noise should ideally have zero mean\nand be conditionally independent of the target output. This requirement is necessary to ensure that the expected loss for self-supervised training asymptotical approaching the supervised loss. However, the input to F(.) in Eq. (9) includes xt*, which is a linear combination of x and x’ (Eq. (6)). Given that x serves as the supervision signal for the loss, this implies a correlation between the input x∗t and the target x, which would violate the conditional independence requirement for J-invariance.\n\n### Questions\n\nIn Eq. (5) on Line 155, the authors highlighted a specific term as the ”major difference” between xt−1 and x^bar_t−1. Could the authors clarify why this particular term is considered the primary source of difference? Furthermore, can the authors elaborate on the underlying reason(s) for the “drift” in the model and how it emerges during the reverse diffusion process?\n\nAccording to the definition of the Fusion process in Eq. (6)  and the “forward process” in Eq. (7), it appears that the starting point for the forward process changes based on t, as x_t* is dependent on t. This dependence implies that the Fusion process dynamically adjusts the starting point of the forward process at each step, which is unconventional compared to typical diffusion models. Could the authors clarify the rationale behind this design?\n\nOther more recent self-supervised denoising methods should be compared, if not for all, e.g., Noise2Score and Recorrupted2Recorrupted etc.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript proposes a self-supervised denoising framework for diffusion MRI (dMRI) that leverages concepts from diffusion probabilistic models. Instead of treating clean/noisy image pairs as two endpoints of a diffusion process, the authors formulate a “diffusion-like” process connecting two diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) with different diffusion encodings. The model predicts one DWI from a time-dependent linear combination of two DWIs and noise, and uses the trained network for conditional sampling to reconstruct denoised images. The approach is conceptually interesting and offers a creative adaptation of diffusion modeling to MR denoising. However, key assumptions are questionable, and both theoretical formulation and presentation lack rigor and clarity. Evaluation is based mainly on model fitting metrics, which limits empirical validation and may bias conclusions.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Questionable Assumptions**: The method assumes that DWIs with different diffusion encodings share the same underlying clean image, differing only by independent noise. This assumption does not hold in practice, as diffusion contrast varies substantially across gradient directions and b-values. The consequences of violating this assumption are not discussed.  \n2. **Implicit Noise Modeling**: Although the authors claim the method does not require an explicit noise model, the J-invariance assumption and additive noise formulation effectively impose constraints on noise properties (zero-mean, conditional independence). These should be explicitly acknowledged and justified, especially since additive noise may not hold for magnitude MR data with low SNR.  \n3. **Mathematical and Conceptual Inconsistencies**: Several derivations and notations are inaccurate or unclear. For example, the relationship between Equations (31) and (32) and the interpretation of \\( x_{t-1} \\) as a linear interpolation appear incorrect. Equation (7) conflates a joint and a marginal distribution. The inconsistent labeling of “forward” versus “reverse” processes further confuses the formulation.  \n4. **Violation of J-invariance Conditions**: The training input \\( x_t^* \\), being a mixture of \\( x \\) and \\( x' \\), correlates with the target \\( x \\), contrary to the conditional independence required for valid self-supervised training.  \n5. **Limited and Potentially Biased Evaluation**: The assessment relies solely on goodness-of-fit measures under simulated conditions favorable to the model. Comparisons to more recent self-supervised methods (e.g., Noise2Score, Recorrupted2Recorrupted) are missing.  \n6. **Misleading Physical Statements**: Some descriptions related to MR physics are vague or inaccurate, such as characterizing MR noise as originating from “physical interferences.” Clarification and revision are needed.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify why the highlighted term in Eq. (5) is described as the primary difference between \\( x_{t-1} \\) and \\( \\bar{x}_{t-1} \\), and explain the “drift” observed in the reverse process.  \n- Explain the rationale for redefining the forward process starting point within the Fusion process (Eq. 6–7).  \n- Ensure consistency in notation and variable definitions throughout figures and text.  \n- Several notational inaccuracies and ambiguities (e.g., in Eq. 7 and Fig. 1) should be corrected.  \n- Revise overly strong claims regarding model independence from noise assumptions.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper introduces an innovative idea of using diffusion-like modeling to relate DWIs with different encodings for denoising, and the training strategy to limit hallucinations is interesting. However, the theoretical basis is weakened by invalid assumptions, inconsistent mathematical formulations, and inaccurate claims about noise modeling. The evaluation framework is narrow and lacks comparison to relevant baselines. Substantial clarification of theoretical justifications and presentation is required before the method’s validity can be properly assessed.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**: **Major Revision**",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces Di-Fusion, a self-supervised denoising method for diffusion MRI (dMRI) that leverages diffusion probabilistic models without requiring clean training data. The method addresses three key challenges: (1) a \"Fusion process\" that creates linear interpolations between noisy volumes to avoid drift during sampling, (2) a \"Di-\" process that characterizes real-world noise using differences between independent noisy measurements, and (3) training only the latter diffusion steps (Tc ≤ T) to reduce generative diversity and improve stability. The approach enables adaptive sampling termination based on a controllable SNR threshold (CSNR). Experiments on three dMRI datasets (Stanford HARDI, Sherbrooke 3-Shell, PPMI) and simulated data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks including tractography, microstructure modeling, and DTI fitting compared to methods like DDM2, Patch2Self, and traditional approaches.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - Equation (5) introduces notation ¯xt−1 without clear definition until much later in the text (Section 3.1), creating confusion about the relationship between different trajectory sets {xt} and {¯xt}\n  - The \"mess(·)\" operation in Equation (8) is defined only as \"spatial shuffling\" without mathematical rigor, yet it's critical for the noise characterization claim\n  - Appendix C.1 derivations contain algebraic steps that appear to conflate different probability distributions without proper justification for substituting x∗t in place of x′\n\n• **Insufficient theoretical justification for key design choices**\n  - The claim that training only latter diffusion steps (Tc = 300) reduces \"diverse generative capabilities\" lacks theoretical grounding beyond intuitive explanations (Section 3.2)\n  - No formal analysis of why the Fusion process mathematically prevents drift, despite this being a central contribution (Section 3.1, Figure 1a)\n  - The variance preservation claim for ξx−x′ in Appendix C.2 assumes independence that may not hold in practice for dMRI noise\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - Competing methods use different architectures while claiming \"fair comparison\" - only DDM2, Nr2N, and DIP adopt Di-Fusion's U-Net architecture (Appendix D.1)\n  - The primary evaluation metric (R² for microstructure fitting, Table S2) shows marginal improvements (0.967 vs 0.959 for Nr2N in CSD-CC) that may not be clinically significant\n  - Simulated experiments (Table 1) show high standard deviations for DDM2 and Nr2N but not for Di-Fusion, suggesting potential implementation or hyperparameter optimization bias\n\n• **Limited scope and generalizability concerns**\n  - Method requires specific dMRI acquisition with adjacent volume pairs (j and j-1), which may not be available in many clinical protocols\n  - Noise model assumptions explicitly target only additive Gaussian thermal noise, excluding physiological artifacts common in real dMRI (Section 5, limitations)\n  - Computational overhead of diffusion model sampling (5+ hours training, Section D.1) limits practical clinical adoption compared to methods like Patch2Self\n\n• **Presentation and reproducibility issues**\n  -

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents *Di‑Fusion*, a self‑supervised denoising framework for diffusion MRI (dMRI) based on diffusion probabilistic models that operate without clean target data. The method tackles three primary challenges through novel design elements: a “Fusion” process to mitigate drift during sampling, a “Di‑” process to model real‑world noise from differences between independent measurements, and selective training of the latter diffusion steps to enhance stability while reducing excessive generative variability. The authors further propose an adaptive sampling termination criterion linked to a controllable signal‑to‑noise threshold. Empirical evaluation on three public dMRI datasets and simulated data reports state‑of‑the‑art results in reconstruction and downstream tasks. The work is ambitious and technically detailed, though several theoretical and methodological aspects require clarification and strengthening.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Mathematical formulation and clarity** – Some definitions, such as the notation ¯xₜ₋₁ in Eq. (5) and the operation *mess(·)* in Eq. (8), are introduced without sufficient rigor or timely explanation. Appendix C.1 conflates probability distributions without clear justification for substituting x*ₜ in place of x′.  \n2. **Theoretical justification of design choices** – Claims regarding training only later diffusion steps (Tc = 300) and the drift‑prevention effect of the Fusion process are presented intuitively but lack formal analysis, proofs, or theoretical grounding. Assumed noise independence in variance preservation may not hold for real dMRI.  \n3. **Experimental design and fairness** – Comparisons across competing methods may not be architecturally consistent. Reported gains in R² are marginal and possibly not clinically meaningful. Variation in standard deviations across models suggests potential implementation bias.  \n4. **Scope and generalizability** – The method depends on paired adjacent volumes and assumes additive Gaussian noise, limiting applicability to certain acquisition protocols. The reported computation time (over 5 hours) raises practical concerns for clinical use.  \n5. **Presentation and reproducibility** – Implementation details are fragmented across appendices, figures contain small or overlapping text, and notation is inconsistently presented, reducing reproducibility and readability.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Define all trajectory notations (xₜ, ¯xₜ, x*ₜ) before use.  \n- Provide complete explanations of all operators and hyperparameters within the main text or a consolidated appendix.  \n- Improve figure readability and maintain consistent notation (Fθ vs F).  \n- Include a formal table of symbols.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper presents an original approach with promising empirical outcomes but suffers from gaps in mathematical rigor, theoretical explanation, and experimental fairness. Clarifying core derivations, justifying key assumptions, and reorganizing presentation for transparency would substantially enhance the credibility and reproducibility of the contribution. Computational efficiency and broader applicability also merit further exploration before clinical deployment.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The study is conceptually interesting but requires significant theoretical and methodological strengthening prior to acceptance.",

        "text": "## SELF-SUPERVISED DIFFUSION MRI DENOISING VIA ITERATIVE AND STABLE REFINEMENT\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes Di-Fusion, a self-supervised denoising framework for diffusion MRI that integrates two key ideas into a single-stage diffusion-model pipeline: a Fusion process that mixes the target slice with a neighboring volume to align forward–reverse trajectories and mitigate drift, and a “Di-” process that replaces Gaussian noise with a shuffled, zero-meaned difference between adjacent volumes to better approximate real noise statistics. Training is restricted to the latter diffusion steps to reduce generative diversity and improve stability, and inference uses a Run–Walk accelerated sampler and an adaptive termination criterion based on a normalized discrepancy metric. Experiments across multiple in-vivo datasets and simulations suggest improved downstream microstructure fitting, tractography quality, and SNR/CNR compared to several self-supervised baselines.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe Fusion process to align forward trajectories with the reverse chain is a concrete, intuitive mechanism to mitigate drift and stabilize sampling in a conditional denoising setting.The “Di-” process that builds a data-driven noise source from spatially shuffled inter-volume differences is an interesting alternative to fitting an explicit noise model.Training only the latter diffusion steps is a pragmatic design choice to constrain generative diversity for a restoration task while improving training stability.The Run–Walk nonuniform reverse-time schedule plus an adaptive stopping rule adds a practical control knob to tune denoising strength versus runtime.\n- Experimental rigor and validationEvaluation spans three public dMRI datasets (HARDI, Sherbrooke 3-Shell, PPMI) and simulated fastMRI experiments across multiple noise levels.Downstream validation includes microstructure model fits (DTI, CSD), tractography (OR bundles, FBC metric), and ROI-based SNR/CNR—metrics that are clinically meaningful for diffusion analysis.Ablation studies analyze contributions of Fusion, “Di-” noise, latter-steps training, and the sampling schedule.\n- Clarity of presentationThe paper clearly motivates why fully supervised denoisers are impractical in dMRI and situates the approach relative to Noise2Self-like methods and DDM2.Figures effectively communicate the core mechanisms (Fusion trajectory alignment, training only latter steps, Run–Walk sampling).\n- Significance of contributionsSelf-supervised dMRI denoising with improved tractography and microstructure fitting is clinically relevant.Reducing dependence on many diffusion directions (relative to Patch2Self) can expand applicability to time-constrained clinical protocols.\n\nTechnical novelty and innovation\n\n- The Fusion process to align forward trajectories with the reverse chain is a concrete, intuitive mechanism to mitigate drift and stabilize sampling in a conditional denoising setting.\n- The “Di-” process that builds a data-driven noise source from spatially shuffled inter-volume differences is an interesting alternative to fitting an explicit noise model.\n- Training only the latter diffusion steps is a pragmatic design choice to constrain generative diversity for a restoration task while improving training stability.\n- The Run–Walk nonuniform reverse-time schedule plus an adaptive stopping rule adds a practical control knob to tune denoising strength versus runtime.\n\nExperimental rigor and validation\n\n- Evaluation spans three public dMRI datasets (HARDI, Sherbrooke 3-Shell, PPMI) and simulated fastMRI experiments across multiple noise levels.\n- Downstream validation includes microstructure model fits (DTI, CSD), tractography (OR bundles, FBC metric), and ROI-based SNR/CNR—metrics that are clinically meaningful for diffusion analysis.\n- Ablation studies analyze contributions of Fusion, “Di-” noise, latter-steps training, and the sampling schedule.\n\nClarity of presentation\n\n- The paper clearly motivates why fully supervised denoisers are impractical in dMRI and situates the approach relative to Noise2Self-like methods and DDM2.\n- Figures effectively communicate the core mechanisms (Fusion trajectory alignment, training only latter steps, Run–Walk sampling).\n\nSignificance of contributions\n\n- Self-supervised dMRI denoising with improved tractography and microstructure fitting is clinically relevant.\n- Reducing dependence on many diffusion directions (relative to Patch2Self) can expand applicability to time-constrained clinical protocols.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe J-invariance justification appears inconsistent with the actual training input, which includes x via x_t*; this breaks the input–target independence assumption underpinning the Noise2Self argument used to motivate Eq. (9).The “Di-” process assumes x and x′ are independent corrupted measurements of the same underlying signal y, but in dMRI different gradient directions generally have different clean signals; x − x′ will include signal differences, not only noise.Replacing Gaussian noise with ξx−x′ throughout the chain breaks standard DDPM assumptions; the resulting process lacks theoretical guarantees about consistency or unbiasedness.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesThe adaptive termination criterion d_x and the brain-tissue coefficient b_x are heuristic, with limited sensitivity analyses and unclear cross-dataset calibration (fixed ρ1, ρ2 and a single CSNR).The Run–Walk acceleration is not compared against widely used fast samplers and ODE solvers (e.g., DPM-Solver++, DEIS, multistep samplers), or recent “train-on-few-steps” designs (e.g., Fast-DDPM); wall-clock and quality trade-offs remain underexplored.Main-text comparisons omit some strong practical baselines (e.g., MP-PCA, Noise2Score) that are relegated to the appendix; statistical significance and subject-level variability are not consistently reported.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesNotation is occasionally inconsistent (e.g., λ superscripts/subscripts; “λt1” vs “λ1t”), and some equations are terse or ambiguous, making it hard to verify derivations (especially around Eq. (5), (6), (10), (11)).The role of x vs x′ is described as “mapping from x′ to x,” but both volumes are used to form inputs in training and sampling; this conceptual pivot deserves a clearer and earlier statement.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited empirical comparison against modern accelerated diffusion sampling schemes and recent conditional few-step training strategies.The relationship to DDM2’s noise-estimation stage and the statistical assumptions it relaxes (vs the stronger assumption that x − x′ ≈ noise) would benefit from deeper analysis and quantitative contrasts.\n\nTechnical limitations or concerns\n\n- The J-invariance justification appears inconsistent with the actual training input, which includes x via x_t*; this breaks the input–target independence assumption underpinning the Noise2Self argument used to motivate Eq.

However, since xt is constructed using both x and x′, the input to Fθ is no longer independent of the target x, and the Noise2Self-style equivalence argument does not apply directly. The paper should either provide a revised justification (e.g., showing minimization of Eq. (9) still yields a valid denoiser under the new construction) or avoid over-claiming J-invariance.The “Di-” noise ξx−x′ is only a valid surrogate for noise if x and x′ share the same underlying clean signal y. In dMRI, measurements across different b-vectors are not replicates; thus x − x′ contains signal terms. While the mess(·) spatial shuffle reduces structural leakage, it does not remove intensity-distribution bias induced by signal differences. A theoretical analysis of the bias and an empirical sensitivity study (e.g., pairing volumes within the same shell or repeated directions, or using b0–b0 pairs where available) would strengthen the case.Substituting Gaussian noise distributions with ξx−x′ at both forward and reverse steps departs from the DDPM theory (which relies on Gaussian perturbations to derive closed-form posteriors). The paper treats Fθ as a generic denoiser and proceeds empirically; that is acceptable pragmatically, but the absence of any consistency guarantee or fixed-point analysis warrants caution, especially in clinical applications.Training only the latter steps is a defensible design that reduces model uncertainty for conditional restoration tasks. The ablation over T_c is helpful; still, a brief discussion connecting this choice to recent few-step training/sampling literature would offer a stronger methodological context.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentThe choice of metrics—SNR/CNR in ROIs, microstructure model R², FBC for tractography—aligns with dMRI practice. Results are promising, particularly the R² gains and the qualitative tract coherence.The adaptive termination and Run–Walk gains on runtime are asserted; it would be beneficial to report per-volume wall-clock reductions versus DDPM, DDIM, and DPM-Solver++, alongside quality deltas.The tractography analysis focuses on OR and highlights fewer spurious streamlines while retaining high FBC. Please add subject-level statistics, inter-subject variance, and hypothesis tests to support robustness claims. If possible, include other bundles and tracking settings to show generality.Simulations show stronger performance at higher noise. However, numerical tables use percentages for SSIM, which is acceptable, but ensure units are consistent and that median ± IQR are also reported, given non-Gaussian distributions typical in SSIM/PSNR.Provide sensitivity curves for CSNR and ρ1/ρ2, and an analysis of their transfer across datasets (HARDI, PPMI, Sherbrooke) to support the “universal” threshold claim.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Patch2Self depends on multiple volumes and J-invariance and avoids assuming identical clean signals across directions; Di-Fusion’s appeal is reducing volume dependency and avoiding a separate noise-model stage. However, Patch2Self’s theoretical footing remains strong under the independence-of-noise assumption, whereas Di-Fusion assumes near-replication between x and x′ at points (e.g., for ξx−x′) that may not hold for differing gradients. Please clarify acquisition conditions or pairing strategies that make your assumption reasonable in practice (e.g., within-shell pairing, repeated directions).DDM2 uses a three-stage pipeline; your work simplifies to a single stage and proposes ξx−x′ instead of fitting a Gaussian noise level. A direct, controlled head-to-head should include runtime, denoising strength, preservation of high-frequency details, hallucination checks, and sensitivity to mismatch between noise statistics and ξx−x′. It would also be informative to compare against conditional few-step training (e.g., Fast-DDPM) that directly aligns training and inference time steps.Recent accelerated samplers (DPM-Solver++, DEIS) or learned schedulers are not empirically compared. Given your Run–Walk schedule, a baseline against these methods would contextualize your speed–quality trade-offs.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceIf robust, the approach could broaden denoising benefits to low-direction or time-constrained dMRI protocols, improving tractography and microstructural estimates where clinical constraints dominate.The paper appropriately acknowledges hallucination and runtime concerns. Given the clinical setting, consider adding simple sanity checks: residual maps across many subjects, lesion retention tests, and test–retest reproducibility on public datasets.Since ξx−x′ can be influenced by motion and physiological artifacts (not just thermal noise), the method may inadvertently model artifacts; articulating pre-processing requirements (motion/eddy correction, coil combination strategy) would help practitioners.\n\nTechnical soundness evaluation\n\n- The Fusion process offers a practical way to inject the target signal into the latent xt path, narrowing the reverse trajectory and mitigating drift.

Can you provide a theoretical justification (or an alternative argument) showing that minimizing Eq. (9) remains valid under your Fusion input construction?\n- What acquisition pairing is used when constructing ξx−x′? Are x and x′ from the same shell or repeated directions? Please quantify how much signal difference leaks into ξx−x′ and its effect on bias; a controlled experiment with known repeated directions or b0 pairs would clarify this.\n- How sensitive is the adaptive termination to CSNR and to the thresholds ρ1, ρ2? Can you provide calibration curves and cross-dataset transfer results, and guidance for practitioners on setting these parameters?\n- Could you compare Run–Walk to DPM-Solver++/DEIS and to a few-step training baseline (e.g., Fast-DDPM) in both runtime and quality? This would better contextualize the practical advantages of your sampling strategy.\n- Can you report statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests or nonparametric tests) across subjects for the SNR/CNR and microstructure R² improvements, and for tractography metrics (FBC, streamline counts)? How many subjects per dataset were used for each analysis?\n- Do you observe hallucinations or structure removal under extreme settings (e.g., very small or very large CSNR)? Please include failure cases and a quantitative hallucination check (e.g., residual structure metrics).\n- What architectural details (network, capacity, normalization) and training hyperparameters (T_c, T_r, p, η, σ_t schedule, learning rate, epochs) were used? Will you release code and trained models?\n- How is the first volume (j=1) handled when x′ is unavailable? If wrap-around or b0 pairing is used, please describe any implications for performance.\n- How does performance change when ξx−x′ is replaced by Gaussian z or by residuals estimated via a blind-spot denoiser (as in DDM2 Stage I)? A quantitative ablation would isolate the benefit of the “Di-” process.\n- Can you provide guidance on pre-processing (motion/eddy correction, coil combination) required to satisfy your independence assumptions and to avoid embedding structured artifacts into ξx−x′?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper tackles an important and challenging problem—self-supervised denoising for dMRI—where clean references are unavailable and downstream clinical utility matters. The proposed Fusion and “Di-” processes, the focus on latter diffusion steps, and the adaptive Run–Walk sampling together form a cohesive, single-stage pipeline with encouraging empirical results on in-vivo datasets and simulations. However, the theoretical justification has gaps: the J-invariance equivalence is invoked despite inputs that include the target x, and the construction of ξx−x′ assumes replicate-like measurements that typically do not hold across differing diffusion gradients. These points do not invalidate the method per se, but they weaken claims and suggest a risk of bias or artifact leakage. On the experimental side, the evaluation is broad and uses relevant metrics, yet several crucial comparisons (modern fast samplers, few-step training, stronger baselines in main text) and statistical analyses are missing, and parameter sensitivity for the adaptive stopping is under-characterized. With a strengthened theoretical discussion (or reframing), additional empirical controls and comparisons, and clearer guidance on parameterization and pre-processing, this work could be a valuable addition to self-supervised MRI denoising literature. As it stands, I view the paper as promising and practically interesting but in need of clarification and additional validation to reach a top-tier standard.",

Training is limited to later diffusion steps to enhance stability, while inference applies a Run–Walk sampling schedule and adaptive stopping criterion.

The paper is clearly written, well motivated, and experimentally detailed.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**\n\n1. **Methodological Justification** – The J‑invariance argument is inconsistent with the model input, which includes the target \\(x\\). This undermines the independence assumption used to justify the objective. Similarly, the “Di”-noise formulation assumes paired volumes share identical underlying signals, an assumption that may not hold across diffusion directions, potentially introducing bias.  \n2. **Theoretical Soundness** – Replacing Gaussian noise with \\(\\xi_{x-x'}\\) departs from DDPM theory and removes guarantees of consistency or unbiasedness. A revised justification or discussion of implications is needed.  \n3. **Experimental Coverage** – The adaptive termination rule and Run–Walk schedule are heuristic and only lightly analyzed; cross-dataset sensitivity is unclear. Comparisons with recent accelerated or few-step diffusion samplers (e.g., DPM‑Solver++, DEIS, Fast‑DDPM) are missing, and strong baselines (MP‑PCA, Noise2Score) appear only in the appendix.  \n4. **Statistical Reporting** – The experiments show promising results, yet statistical significance and inter-subject variability are not systematically reported.  \n5. **Clarity and Presentation** – Some equations have inconsistent notation and terseness that hinder verification. The conceptual role of \\(x\\) versus \\(x'\\) should be clarified earlier.  \n6. **Related Work** – The relationship to DDM2 and Patch2Self’s theoretical assumptions should be elaborated. Head‑to‑head runtime and quality comparisons would better contextualize Di-Fusion.  \n7. **Broader Validity** – Since \\(\\xi_{x-x'}\\) may capture motion or physiological artifacts, guidance on preprocessing requirements and sanity checks (e.g., residual maps, test–retest reproducibility) would strengthen reliability claims.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**\n\n- Ensure consistent notation (e.g., λ superscripts/subscripts).  \n- Report units and dispersion (median ± IQR) for SSIM/PSNR metrics.  \n- Provide sensitivity analyses for the adaptive thresholds (ρ₁, ρ₂, CSNR).  \n- Clarify how the first volume is handled when no \\(x'\\) is available.  \n- Include additional tract bundles and subject‑level statistics in tractography results.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**\n\nOverall, the paper presents a creative and potentially impactful self‑supervised denoising approach for diffusion MRI, combining trajectory fusion, data‑driven noise modeling, and adaptive inference. Its strengths lie in the originality of the design, breadth of experiments, and practical motivation. Nonetheless, theoretical inconsistencies in the J‑invariance and noise assumptions, limited benchmarking against the latest diffusion sampling methods, and partial reporting of statistical analyses weaken the current evidential basis. Clarifying these theoretical foundations, expanding validation, and refining methodological exposition would substantially strengthen the work.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**\n\n**Major Revision.** The contribution is promising but requires stronger theoretical justification, broader comparisons, and improved empirical and statistical validation to fully support its claims.",

        "text": "# Review Report for IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThe paper addresses the critical challenge of denoising diffusion MRI (dMRI) data, where low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compromises clinical utility without requiring clean reference data. The authors propose Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising framework that leverages diffusion models with several key innovations: (1) a Fusion process to align the forward diffusion trajectory and prevent drift, (2) a \"Di-\" process to better characterize real-world noise distributions without extra noise modeling, and (3) training only the latter diffusion steps with an adaptive sampling process for stable and controllable refinement. The method is validated across three public dMRI datasets (Stanford HARDI, Sherbrooke 3-Shell, and PPMI) and simulated data, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in multiple clinically relevant downstream tasks. Specifically, Di-Fusion achieves the highest R² values in microstructure modeling (CSD and DTI), better fiber bundle coherency in tractography with minimal streamline count, and improved diffusion signal estimates (FA, MD, AD, RD) while maintaining anatomical fidelity. The approach requires only one additional volume for denoising, making it clinically practical compared to methods needing 10+ volumes.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths\n- **Clinically practical framework**: The single-stage architecture eliminates the need for clean reference data or multiple training stages (unlike DDM2), making it feasible for clinical deployment where clean data is unavailable\n- **Innovative Fusion process**: Effectively addresses the drift problem common in diffusion-based denoising by aligning the forward process with the target slice\n- **Comprehensive clinical validation**: Demonstrates superiority not just on standard metrics but across multiple downstream clinical tasks (microstructure modeling, tractography, diffusion signal estimation)\n- **\"Di-\" process**: Provides a more accurate characterization of real-world noise compared to standard Gaussian assumptions, validated through statistical analysis\n\n### Major Limitations\n- **Computational cost**: While the authors note the sampling time is reduced through adaptive termination, the overall computational burden compared to non-diffusion methods like Patch2Self could be better quantified and contextualized for clinical deployment\n- **Hyperparameter justification**: Limited exploration of why T_c=300 (for latter diffusion steps) is optimal, with only a brief comment that performance is consistent when T_c<500\n- **Clinical parameter guidance**: The CSNR threshold for adaptive termination is not sufficiently linked to clinical outcomes; how clinicians should select this parameter for specific diagnostic purposes is unclear\n\n### Minor Strengths\n- **Clear visualization**: The figures effectively illustrate the diffusion process, drift prevention, and adaptive sampling mechanism\n- **Superior noise characterization**: The \"Di-\" process is convincingly shown to capture noise properties better than Gaussian assumptions (Fig. S20)\n- **Reduced volume dependency**: Only one additional volume needed compared to Patch2Self's 10+ requirement, expanding clinical applicability\n\n### Minor Limitations\n- **Figure organization**: Some supplementary figures (e.g., Fig. S24) combine multiple ablation studies, making interpretation challenging\n- **Inconsistent terminology**: Occasional inconsistent use of terms like \"latter diffusion steps\" vs \"latter diffusion steps\"\n- **Limited b-value analysis**: While the method shows robustness to mixed b-values, this could be explored more deeply\n\n## 3. Evaluation Summary\n\n**Significance (High)**: The work addresses a critical clinical need for dMRI denoising where clean reference data is unavailable. The demonstrated improvements in downstream tasks (microstructure modeling, tractography) directly impact diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making. The method's ability to work with minimal additional volumes (one vs ten required by Patch2Self) significantly enhances its clinical applicability, potentially enabling better diagnostic quality from existing dMRI protocols without requiring longer scan times or reduced spatial resolution.\n\n**Innovation (High)**: The paper presents several novel contributions: (1) the Fusion process that aligns the diffusion trajectory to prevent drift, (2) the \"Di-\" process for more accurate noise characterization, and (3) the adaptive Run-Walk sampling with controllable refinement. These components form a cohesive single-stage framework that fundamentally differs from prior multi-stage approaches like DDM2. The creative integration of statistical self-supervised techniques with diffusion models represents a meaningful advancement in the field, with potential applicability beyond dMRI.\n\n**Evaluation (High)**: The evaluation is exceptionally thorough, with comparisons against multiple state-of-the-art methods across three public dMRI datasets and simulated data. The authors go beyond standard metrics to validate performance on clinically relevant downstream tasks, providing R² scores for microstructure modeling, fiber bundle coherency for tractography, and diffusion signal estimates. The ablation studies are comprehensive, testing each component's contribution. However, the main paper could benefit from including more comparisons with diffusion-based approaches (currently largely in supplementary materials).\n\n**Reproducibility (High)**: The paper provides sufficient detail for reproduction, including complete algorithms for training and sampling, noise schedule details, and implementation parameters. The supplementary materials offer extensive ablation studies and additional comparisons. The authors mention code availability, and the computational requirements (RTX 3090, 5 hours for training) are clearly stated. Including more specific guidance on selecting CSNR for different clinical applications would further enhance reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThe paper presents a significant and innovative contribution to self-supervised dMRI denoising with strong clinical relevance. The technical approach is sound, the evaluation is comprehensive, and the clinical validation is particularly compelling. The method demonstrates clear advantages over existing approaches across multiple metrics and downstream tasks.\n\nThe following relatively straightforward revisions would strengthen the paper:\n1. Provide more detailed justification for key hyperparameters (especially T_c=300)\n2. Elaborate on clinical guidance for selecting the CSNR threshold\n3. Streamline some supplementary material figures for better readability\n4. Include a brief computational comparison with non-diffusion methods to contextualize the computational cost\n\nThese revisions are relatively minor and would not require additional experiments. The paper is already of high quality and would benefit from these refinements before final acceptance. The contribution represents a meaningful advancement in the field that would be of interest to the TMI readership.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThe manuscript tackles the challenge of denoising diffusion‑weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in situations where low signal‑to‑noise ratio hampers clinical use and clean reference data are unavailable. The authors evaluate their approach on three publicly available in‑vivo brain dMRI datasets (Stanford HARDI, Sherbrooke multi‑shell, PPMI) and on simulated fastMRI k‑space data subjected to various noise levels. Their method, named Di‑Fusion, is a fully self‑supervised diffusion‑model framework that incorporates (i) a Fusion step to align forward trajectories, (ii) a “Di‑” component that extracts noise statistics without a separate noise‑model training phase, and (iii) an adaptive Run‑Walk sampling scheme that iteratively refines the output and permits early termination. Training is limited to the later diffusion steps, which the authors argue reduces generative variance. Reported results show improvements in peak‑signal‑to‑noise ratio, structural similarity index, and downstream measures such as micro‑structure model fitting and tractography coherence, indicating that the method can provide stable, iterative dMRI denoising without paired clean images.\n\n---\n\n**## General feedback**\n\n- **Significance:** Denoising dMRI without access to clean data is an important problem for both clinical and research workflows; a self‑supervised diffusion‑model that promises stable training and controllable sampling could have wide applicability.  \n- **Innovation:** The paper introduces a combination of (i) Fusion alignment, (ii) the Di‑ noise estimator, (iii) restriction of training to the later diffusion steps, and (iv) Run‑Walk adaptive sampling. This set of contributions is novel relative to earlier self‑supervised methods such as Patch2Self and DDM2.  \n- **Evaluation:** The authors provide an extensive quantitative and downstream assessment (PSNR/SSIM, tractography FBC, R² of micro‑structure fits, SNR/CNR). However, the presented results lack measures of variance or statistical significance, and several recent diffusion‑based denoisers (e.g., score‑based, cold‑diffusion approaches) are not included in the comparison.  \n- **Reproducibility:** Training details (optimizer, learning rate, batch size) are reported in Section 3.2 and Appendix D.1, yet many hyper‑parameters (β‑schedule, Tc, Tr, p, CSNR thresholds) are only briefly described or confined to supplemental figures. Moreover, the code link is a placeholder (“github.com/XXX”), which prevents verification of the implementation.\n\n---\n\n**## Specific comments/critiques**\n\n- **Method clarity:** The derivations in Sections 3.1–3.3 and Appendix C are dense. A high‑level schematic illustrating the Fusion and Di‑ processes would aid comprehension; presently only Fig. 1 (a) serves this purpose.  \n- **Justification of later‑step training:** The authors claim that limiting training to the later diffusion steps reduces uncertainty, but no ablation study comparing full‑step versus later‑step training is provided to substantiate this assertion.  \n- **Noise representation limitations:** The Di‑ component relies on shuffling the difference between two independent noisy volumes (Eq. 8). It is unclear how the method would perform when only a single volume is available or when noise exhibits spatial correlation (e.g., physiological noise).  \n- **Adaptive termination sensitivity:** The CSNR threshold used for early termination (Eq. 13) is fixed across experiments. A sensitivity analysis showing the effect of varying CSNR values on denoising quality and runtime would be informative.  \n- **Baseline coverage:** Recent diffusion‑based denoisers such as score‑based denoising and cold diffusion are omitted from the comparative study, despite being mentioned in the background (Section 2.2). Including these baselines would strengthen the claim of state‑of‑the‑art performance.  \n- **Statistical analysis:** Tables (e.g., Table 1, Table S2, Table S5) present only mean values; standard deviations, confidence intervals, or p‑values are absent, leaving the statistical significance of the reported gains uncertain.  \n- **Runtime reporting:** Training time (~5 h on an RTX 3090) is reported, but inference speed (sampling time per volume, impact of Run‑Walk acceleration) is not quantified, even though the manuscript discusses “relatively longer inference” in Section 5.  \n- **Code availability:** The repository link is a placeholder, which prevents reviewers and readers from reproducing the experiments or inspecting implementation details.  \n- **Typographical issues:** Numerous LaTeX rendering problems (e.g., misplaced brackets, “_√_ ~~α~~”) impede readability of equations and figure captions; a thorough proof‑read is needed.  \n- **Downstream clinical relevance:** The manuscript demonstrates improvements in tractography FBC and R² fits, yet it does not discuss the practical clinical impact of these gains (e.g., expert evaluation, patient‑level outcomes).\n\n---\n\n**## A suggested decision**\n\n**Major Revision** – The manuscript requires substantial revisions, particularly concerning baseline comparisons, statistical analysis, and reproducibility provisions, before it can be considered for publication.",

In this study, we propose the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS), a novel method inspired by state space modeling, to evaluate the encoding space of LVMs from medical images using the encoding space of Large Language Models (LLMs) from medical reports. Through extensive experimentation on 32 datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas collection using five state-of-the-art LLMs, we first establish a baseline of LLMs' performance in digital pathology and show that LLMs' encoding can be linked to patient outcomes. Then, we compared seven LVMs with BSS and showed that LVMs suffer from poor semantic capability when compared with encoded expert knowledge from pathology reports.\nWe also found statistically significant correlations between BSS (as a measure of structural similarity) and performance in two downstream tasks: information retrieval and survival prediction tasks. Our study also investigates the consensus among LLMs in evaluating LVMs using BSS, indicating that LLMs generally reach substantial consensus in rating LVMs, with some variation dependant on the cancer type.

This may indicate that BSS lacks robustness across different types of tasks, especially in more complex medical applications. Therefore, its effectiveness as a general semantic metric remains to be further validated.\n3.The experiments focus on the tasks of information retrieval and survival prediction, but these tasks may differ in nature from other potential tasks. The consistency of LLMs and the effectiveness of BSS in other semantic tasks require further experimental validation across a broader range of tasks.\n4.The paper focuses on evaluating the semantic capabilities of existing LVMs, but it lacks concrete suggestions on how to improve their semantic performance. Although the limitations of LVMs are highlighted, there is little discussion on how to optimize or modify their architectures to overcome these shortcomings.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.Could the authors suggest ways to optimize BSS for large-scale datasets, or clarify if any tests on smaller subsets were conducted for comparative analysis?\n2.

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI:**  \n✅ The manuscript sits squarely within the methodological scope of IEEE TMI. It introduces a new metric—**the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS)**—for evaluating large vision models (LVMs) by leveraging the embedding spaces of large language models (LLMs) applied to paired image–text data from medical pathology. The paper focuses on foundational mathematical formulation, algorithmic definition, and quantitative validation using large-scale medical datasets (TCGA), rather than an application case study. The contribution is methodological and generalizable to medical imaging domains.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level:**  \nModerate to high novelty. BSS introduces a formal probabilistic framework (based on Boltzmann factors and state-space analogy) for quantifying cross-modal semantic alignment between medical image and text embeddings. Unlike prior comparative studies of LVM–LLM correlations, this work defines a differentiable and theoretically motivated metric. The notion of “semantic similarity” between modalities grounded in energy-based modeling is new within medical imaging evaluation. The theoretical innovation is meaningful, though empirical validation still relies on standard dataset/architecture comparisons.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor:**  \nThe manuscript is strong in theoretical exposition, with clear equations and algorithmic outlines. Experimental design is extensive: five LLMs, seven LVMs, 32 TCGA cohorts, and two downstream tasks (retrieval and survival). The statistical methods (Pearson correlation tests, cross-validation, standard retrieval and survival evaluation metrics) are appropriate. Reproducibility is aided by public code and detailed appendices.  \nPotential gaps:  \n- The description of hyperparameters and data preprocessing, while extensive in the appendix, could still be summarized in the main text for clarity.  \n- Limited ablation on the sensitivity of BSS hyperparameters (e.g., *k* selection, influence of LLM choice).  \n- The baseline comparison to existing semantic or alignment metrics (e.g., CCA-based measures, mutual information) is missing.  \n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation:**  \nVery well organized and clearly written for a technically complex topic. Figures are numerous and generally informative. The mathematical narrative (from intuitive derivation to formal algorithm) is sound, though slightly dense in mid-section 3. Minor language and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., spacing, figure callouts). Overall readability is high.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance:**  \nDataset usage (public TCGA), de-identification, and preprocessing are transparently described. Code availability is promised. Ethical statements about patient privacy and bias are explicitly included in the appendix. The study meets TMI reproducibility and compliance expectations.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \nThe authors propose the **Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS)**, a theoretically derived cross-modal metric to evaluate the semantic alignment between visual features from large vision models (LVMs) and textual encodings from large language models (LLMs) in medical imaging. Using TCGA pathology images and reports, they validate BSS as a measure of semantic correspondence that correlates with downstream task performance (retrieval, survival prediction). The study argues that BSS provides a quantitative, scalable alternative to expert-based qualitative evaluations.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n- Clear methodological innovation linking statistical mechanics with multimodal embedding evaluation.  \n- Large-scale empirical validation across dozens of cancer datasets.  \n- Transparent code/data availability and detailed experiments.  \n- Conceptually bridges LLM-based reasoning with visual representation quality assessment in medicine.  \n- Potential extensibility beyond pathology to other imaging–text modalities.  \n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n- Limited comparative analysis with existing quantitative alignment metrics (e.g., cosine similarity baselines, cross-modal contrastive losses).  \n- The connection between BSS magnitude and specific model behaviors is descriptive rather than mechanistically analyzed.  \n- Writing occasionally conflates “semantic” with “clinical” relevance—clarify interpretability versus outcome prediction.  \n- Some figures (e.g., dense multipanel charts) could be simplified for readability.  \n- Statistical significance is shown for correlations but effect size interpretation is modest.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n- **Contextual Comparison:** Include comparison or discussion against established metrics for modality alignment (e.g., CCA, linear alignment, information-theoretic similarity), situating BSS within quantitative literature.  \n- **Sensitivity and Robustness:** Provide a brief ablation or analytic justification of the choice of *k* in neighborhood graphs and of the Boltzmann formulation constants.  \n- **Interpretability / Usability:** Discuss what a specific BSS value implies operationally—how practitioners might use it to compare or tune LVMs.  \n- **Generalization / Future Work:** Summarize in main text (not only appendix) how BSS could inform model training (e.g., as a loss), since this is important for TMI’s methodological emphasis.  \n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n- Correct minor typographical spacing (“LVMs,” “Boltzmann’s,” etc.).  \n- Improve axis labeling readability in Figs. 5–8.  \n- Condense the introduction by merging some background on foundation models.  \n- Ensure consistent citation formatting (some “et al.” listings inconsistent).  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.**  \nThe paper introduces an interesting and potentially impactful metric, with sound theory and strong experiments. However, to meet TMI’s threshold for methodological completeness, the authors should (a) include direct comparison with alternative semantic similarity metrics, (b) perform a limited ablation to confirm robustness, and (c) clarify interpretability and practical relevance. Addressing these points would elevate the contribution from exploratory to mature methodological advancement.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** **5 / 5** — reviewer is confident in evaluation given background in imaging–AI methodology.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Statement for Editors:**  \nThe submission offers a novel, theoretically grounded metric that could become a useful tool for assessing and aligning multimodal medical foundation models. It is methodologically innovative, scientifically rigorous, and well executed. With additional comparative and robustness analyses, it is likely to reach the publication standard of IEEE TMI.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS), a novel metric to evaluate Large Vision Models (LVMs) using Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic references. The method addresses the question of whether LVMs extract medically relevant features similar to human experts by comparing structural similarity between LVM and LLM embedding spaces. The authors first establish LLM baselines on 32 TCGA datasets using five state-of-the-art LLMs for information retrieval and survival prediction tasks. They then propose BSS, inspired by statistical mechanics and Boltzmann distributions, to measure semantic alignment between vision and text encodings. The method constructs k-nearest neighbor graphs in both modalities and computes semantic scores based on matching and non-matching states. Experiments on seven LVMs show generally low BSS values, indicating poor semantic capability. The authors demonstrate statistically significant correlations between BSS and downstream task performance, and show substantial consensus among LLMs in ranking LVMs using Cohen's kappa scores.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - The transition from Boltzmann factor in Equation 2 to the constant √d1 replacing kT lacks proper justification (Section 3.3, Page 5), making the physical analogy questionable\n  - The definition of sets A and D in Equations 4-5 (Page 5) contains unclear notation where Li = Lj relationships are not precisely defined\n  - Algorithm 1 (Page 19) lacks mathematical rigor in describing how \"corresponding nodes\" are identified in the observer graph\n  - The normalization in Equation 6 (Page 5) assumes non-zero denominators but provides no handling for edge cases\n\n• **Experimental design and validation limitations**\n  - BSS correlations with downstream tasks show high variability across datasets (Table 3a-3b, Page 9) with some non-significant results, questioning the metric's reliability\n  - The choice of k=5 neighbors (Figures 5-6, Pages 8-9) appears arbitrary with insufficient ablation studies on this critical hyperparameter\n  - Survival prediction experiments use only 8 cancer types (Table 2, Page 8) while information retrieval uses all 32, creating inconsistent evaluation scope\n  - The supervised pooling methodology using AbMIL (Section J.2, Page 19) introduces task-specific bias that may confound BSS measurements\n\n• **Methodological assumptions and theoretical foundation concerns**\n  - The fundamental assumption that LLM representations serve as ground truth for medical semantics lacks empirical validation beyond retrieval tasks (Section 3.1, Page 3)\n  - The physical analogy to statistical mechanics appears forced, with energy differences defined as L2 distances without theoretical justification (Equation 2, Page 5)\n  - The method assumes semantic similarity should correspond to spatial proximity in embedding spaces, which may not hold across different model architectures\n  - No comparison with existing semantic evaluation metrics or human expert validation is provided to establish BSS validity\n\n• **Reproducibility and generalization challenges**\n  - Critical implementation details for graph construction and nearest neighbor computation are missing from the main text\n  - The consensus analysis (Figure 7, Page 9) shows moderate agreement for some LLM pairs, suggesting potential inconsistencies in BSS computation\n  - Dataset-specific performance variations (Figures 5-6, Pages 8-9) raise questions about BSS generalizability across different medical domains\n  - The method's dependence on specific LLM architectures may limit its applicability as foundation models evolve\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen mathematical rigor and theoretical foundation**\n  - Provide rigorous justification for the choice of √d1 as the temperature equivalent, including sensitivity analysis across different dimensionalities\n  - Clarify the mathematical definition of matching states in sets A and D with explicit algorithmic descriptions\n  - Add formal complexity analysis and convergence properties of the BSS computation\n  - Include theoretical analysis of BSS behavior under different embedding space properties\n\n• **Enhance experimental validation and consistency**\n  - Conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the k parameter across multiple values and datasets to justify the choice of k=5\n  - Expand survival prediction experiments to all 32 cancer types for consistent comparison with retrieval tasks\n  - Include comparison with existing semantic similarity metrics and human expert evaluations as validation benchmarks\n  - Separate analysis of supervised vs unsupervised pooling effects on BSS to isolate methodological confounds\n\n• **Validate core methodological assumptions**\n  - Provide empirical evidence that LLM representations truly capture medical semantics beyond simple keyword matching\n  - Compare BSS with direct human expert assessments of LVM semantic quality on a subset of cases\n  - Investigate the relationship between embedding space geometry and semantic meaning across different model architectures\n  - Include analysis of failure cases where BSS may not reflect true semantic alignment\n\n• **Improve reproducibility and broader applicability**\n  - Provide complete algorithmic specifications and open-source implementation for all BSS computation steps\n  - Address the consensus variability issue by investigating sources of disagreement between different LLMs\n  - Test BSS stability across different medical domains and imaging modalities beyond pathology\n  - Develop guidelines for selecting appropriate reference LLMs and handling cases where LLM consensus is low",

The authors establish baselines for five LLMs on text-only retrieval and survival prediction across TCGA cohorts, then compute BSS for seven LVMs under unsupervised and supervised pooling, and analyze correlations between BSS and downstream performance as well as inter-LLM consensus via Cohen’s kappa. The results suggest (i) LLM embeddings capture clinically relevant information linked to patient outcomes, (ii) current LVMs exhibit limited semantic alignment to text-defined structures, and (iii) BSS is positively correlated with downstream retrieval and survival metrics in several cohorts.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationProposes a simple, training-free metric (BSS) for cross-modal structural alignment that does not require joint training or architectural coupling between LVMs and LLMs.The “second-order” degeneracy idea attempts to account for non-matching neighbors by incorporating relative structure within the reference (text) space rather than only 1:1 k-NN overlap.Positions BSS as a semantically grounded alternative to purely qualitative assessments (e.g., attention maps), aiming for scalable, quantitative evaluation.\n- Experimental rigor and validationWide coverage across 32 TCGA datasets for text-only tasks and 8 cohorts for BSS/LVM analyses, with multiple LLMs and LVMs considered.Perturbed-text retrieval experiments help mitigate the concern that LLM performance is driven only by keyword matching, showing retained performance after removing key terms.Correlation analysis between BSS and downstream metrics (retrieval accuracy and survival C-index) provides initial evidence that BSS captures task-relevant structure.Inter-LLM consensus analysis is a thoughtful attempt to quantify agreement across reference encoders, rarely reported in qualitative evaluation settings.\n- Clarity of presentationHigh-level motivation is clear: replace small-sample, subjective expert inspections with scalable, objective semantics inferred from reports.The pipeline components (LLM text embedding, LVM image pooling, k-NN construction, summary statistics) are explained at an intuitive level.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses an important gap in computational pathology: how to assess whether vision encoders capture human-relevant semantics without training a new multimodal model.If refined, BSS could become a useful diagnostic/evaluation tool during model development and selection, complementing standard downstream task leaderboards.\n\n- Proposes a simple, training-free metric (BSS) for cross-modal structural alignment that does not require joint training or architectural coupling between LVMs and LLMs.\n- The “second-order” degeneracy idea attempts to account for non-matching neighbors by incorporating relative structure within the reference (text) space rather than only 1:1 k-NN overlap.\n- Positions BSS as a semantically grounded alternative to purely qualitative assessments (e.g., attention maps), aiming for scalable, quantitative evaluation.\n\n- Wide coverage across 32 TCGA datasets for text-only tasks and 8 cohorts for BSS/LVM analyses, with multiple LLMs and LVMs considered.\n- Perturbed-text retrieval experiments help mitigate the concern that LLM performance is driven only by keyword matching, showing retained performance after removing key terms.\n- Correlation analysis between BSS and downstream metrics (retrieval accuracy and survival C-index) provides initial evidence that BSS captures task-relevant structure.\n- Inter-LLM consensus analysis is a thoughtful attempt to quantify agreement across reference encoders, rarely reported in qualitative evaluation settings.\n\n- High-level motivation is clear: replace small-sample, subjective expert inspections with scalable, objective semantics inferred from reports.\n- The pipeline components (LLM text embedding, LVM image pooling, k-NN construction, summary statistics) are explained at an intuitive level.\n\n- Addresses an important gap in computational pathology: how to assess whether vision encoders capture human-relevant semantics without training a new multimodal model.\n- If refined, BSS could become a useful diagnostic/evaluation tool during model development and selection, complementing standard downstream task leaderboards.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe Boltzmann formalism is only loosely justified: mapping “energy” to Euclidean distance and setting kT = sqrt(d1) is ad hoc; no principled calibration or sensitivity analysis is provided.The “second-order” factor b_{i;j|q} uses only distances within the text space; visual distances influence only membership in near(Vq, k), not quantitative scoring, which may under-utilize visual geometry.A key inconsistency: for matching pairs (i, j) ∈ A with Li = Lj, b_{i;j|q} should equal p_i/p_q (not 1), yet the text states b = 1; this affects the normalization in Eq. (6) and casts doubt on the correctness of the derivation.Lack of invariance considerations: BSS uses L2 distances in high-dimensional spaces; cosine similarity or a learned/estimated temperature might be more appropriate and robust.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesMissing comparisons with established structural similarity baselines (e.g., k-NN overlap/Jaccard, Spearman/Kendall correlation of distance/rank lists, Procrustes alignment, CKA/local-CKA) make it hard to assess whether BSS offers advantages beyond simpler measures.The retrieval evaluation description is ambiguous: at times it reads as label-based retrieval using LLM text embeddings; at others, it appears to involve visual features. The exact query/target setup, train/test separation (leave-one-out vs within-set), and label usage should be clarified to rule out leakage or trivial cues.The inter-LLM agreement on “rankings” is measured using Cohen’s kappa (for categorical labels), whereas rank correlation (Kendall tau/Spearman) would be more appropriate for ordinal/full ranking data.Multiple-testing correction is absent for extensive correlation analyses (LLMs × cohorts × tasks), raising the risk of false positives.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSeveral typographical/formatting artifacts, equation misalignments, and duplicated captions (likely from PDF extraction) hinder readability; the formal definitions of sets A and D and the mapping between non-matching (i, j) pairs require clearer algorithmic specification.The survival analysis setup is not fully detailed (e.g., covariate usage beyond embeddings, how censored data are handled beyond RSF defaults, per-cohort sample sizes after filtering).\n- Missing related work or comparisonsNo direct comparison to representation-similarity approaches (e.g., CKA/local-CKA for cross-modal alignment without training) that target a closely related question.Limited engagement with recent pathology vision–language alignment works (e.g., PathAlign, TITAN, SlideChat) that explicitly target slide–text semantic alignment; these could serve as reference points to contextualize what “low BSS” means when text–image are jointly trained.\n\n- The Boltzmann formalism is only loosely justified: mapping “energy” to Euclidean distance and setting kT = sqrt(d1) is ad hoc; no principled calibration or sensitivity analysis is provided.\n- The “second-order” factor b_{i;j|q} uses only distances within the text space; visual distances influence only membership in near(Vq, k), not quantitative scoring, which may under-utilize visual geometry.\n- A key inconsistency: for matching pairs (i, j) ∈ A with Li = Lj, b_{i;j|q} should equal p_i/p_q (not 1), yet the text states b = 1; this affects the normalization in Eq.

In high dimensions, distance concentration can distort probabilities; a data-driven temperature (e.g., percentiles of distance, median absolute deviation) or cosine distance could improve calibration and interpretability.The second-order factor b_{i;j|q} := (p_i/p_j)·(p_i/p_q) is intended to penalize observer-only neighbors V_j that do not appear among reference neighbors. However, as defined, it ignores visual-space distances beyond membership and relies fully on L-space geometry between Li, Lj, and Lq. Consider incorporating a term reflecting how strongly V_j is favored in visual space (e.g., weight by similarity rank or distance to V_q) to better capture the degree of mismatch.The mismatch for (i, j) ∈ A: b_{i;j|q} equals p_i/p_q, not 1, unless p_i = p_q. The text explicitly states b = 1, which contradicts Eq. (3). This should be corrected, as it affects normalization in Eq. (6) and may change empirical values of BSS.Definitions of A and D (Eqs. 4–5) are hard to parse programmatically. The procedure for pairing non-matching sets (i, j) is under-specified (e.g., is i the closest unmatched reference neighbor to Lj, or a fixed index pairing by position?). Please provide a precise algorithm and complexity analysis for building A and D.Invariance and stability: BSS depends on k, distance metric, normalization, and neighbor search implementation. An ablation on k, metric (cosine vs Euclidean), feature normalization (e.g., whitening), and temperature would strengthen claims of robustness.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentLLM retrieval: The organ-specific and organ-independent protocols need clearer definitions of query/target pools. If “cancer type” is the retrieval label, the evaluation might reflect class clustering rather than nuanced semantic retrieval. Clarify whether retrieval is leave-one-out over the full corpus of reports and whether any splitting avoids trivial self-retrieval or near-duplicate leakage.Perturbation tests are valuable; however, more systematic perturbations (e.g., selectively removing micro- vs macro- sections, shuffling sentence order, masking site identifiers) could isolate which parts of pathology reports primarily drive LLM performance.Survival prediction with RSF shows promising C-indices for certain cancers; please clarify whether additional clinical covariates were included (or not), the handling of class imbalance/censoring, and whether external validation cohorts were available. Given the field’s variability, external validation or robustness checks (e.g., site-stratified CV) would materially raise confidence.BSS on LVMs: Reporting only eight cohorts limits generalization; a rationale for cohort selection and an analysis of cohort-specific factors (e.g., morphological signal vs report content mismatch) would help interpret low BSS. Additionally, reporting variance across seeds/folds for AbMIL is important.Statistical testing: The numerous Pearson tests warrant multiple-comparison correction (e.g., Benjamini–Hochberg FDR). Some p-values in Table 3b appear near 0.96, consistent with non-significance; please mark significant tests post-correction and discuss the overall pattern cautiously.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Training-free alignment methods (e.g., local-CKA and QAP-based matching) explicitly target the same hypothesis—whether independently trained vision and language encoders share latent semantics—and provide quantitative baselines. Including CKA/local-CKA or simpler k-NN-overlap metrics as baselines would contextualize BSS and demonstrate its added value.Recent WSI–text alignment frameworks (PathAlign, TITAN, SlideChat) show that slide–text semantics can be brought into closer concordance when jointly trained; their presence suggests that “low BSS” for single-modality SSL vision encoders may reflect absence of cross-modal supervision rather than fundamental semantic deficiency. A useful experiment would compare BSS for (i) vision-only SSL encoders vs (ii) vision–language aligned encoders (where available) to test whether BSS reflects known improvements from multimodal alignment.QwenCLIP highlights the value of dedicated LLM embedding models for long clinical text. Given long TCGA reports, comparing BSS computed with an embedding-oriented LLM (or biomedical sentence encoders) versus generative LLMs used as encoders could be informative and might increase inter-LLM agreement and stability.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe central question—do vision encoders capture clinically meaningful semantics?—is highly relevant. However, pathology reports contain information not fully visible in WSIs (e.g., gross descriptions, staging, ancillary tests). Low BSS might thus partially reflect modality mismatch. An analysis restricting reports to microscopy sections (when available) or projecting onto a controlled set of morphological concepts could better isolate visual semantics.The consensus analysis is a practical contribution. Still, rank correlation would be more appropriate than kappa for ranking agreement. If high agreement persists with Kendall tau/Spearman, it strengthens the claim that BSS-based rankings are not idiosyncratic to one LLM.If refined (baselines, calibration, invariance), BSS could provide a domain-agnostic template for evaluating representation alignment across modalities, potentially beyond medicine.\n\n- The adoption of a Boltzmann factor exp(−ΔE/kT) with ΔE defined as L2 distance and kT fixed to sqrt(d1) lacks theoretical grounding.

A step-by-step algorithm (with pseudocode) would help resolve ambiguities.\n- For (i, j) ∈ A with Li = Lj, why is b_{i;j|q} set to 1 instead of p_i/p_q as implied by Eq. (3)? If this is a typo, how does using p_i/p_q change BSS empirically?\n- How sensitive is BSS to the choice of k, distance metric (L2 vs cosine), feature scaling, and the temperature (kT)? Have you explored data-driven or learned temperatures?\n- In the retrieval experiments, what exactly is the query—an embedded report or a label? Is retrieval leave-one-out over the entire corpus, and how are near-duplicates or multiple reports per patient handled?\n- Did you evaluate BSS against simpler baselines (k-NN overlap/Jaccard, Kendall/Spearman correlation of rankings, CKA/local-CKA, Procrustes alignment)? If not, can you add these to quantify the incremental value of BSS?\n- For consensus, why use Cohen’s kappa for rankings instead of Kendall tau or Spearman? Do qualitative conclusions hold under rank correlation?\n- In survival prediction, were any clinical covariates used beyond text embeddings? How were site effects handled (e.g., site-stratified CV) and were there external validation cohorts?\n- Given that reports include non-visual information, have you tested BSS using only microscopy sections or pathology-specific concept embeddings to better match the visual modality?\n- Could you provide details for LLM embedding extraction (model mode, pooling strategy, context window limits, truncation policy, tokenization) and whether any domain-specific sentence encoders were tested?\n- What is the runtime and memory profile for computing BSS on 9k+ samples, and how does it scale with larger datasets (e.g., 100k+ reports/slides)?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe paper tackles an important and underexplored problem: quantitatively assessing whether vision encoders in computational pathology capture clinically meaningful semantics absent multimodal training. The proposed BSS is novel and the experimental scope is commendable, including multi-LLM baselines, perturbation tests, correlations to downstream tasks, and consensus analysis. However, the current formulation suffers from theoretical ambiguities (most notably, an inconsistency in the second-order factor for matched neighbors, heuristic temperature selection, and limited use of visual geometry), missing comparisons to established structural-similarity baselines, and some methodological clarity issues (retrieval protocol details, appropriate rank-agreement metrics, multiple-testing correction). I view this work as a promising direction with substantial potential impact if the metric is better grounded, more thoroughly validated against baselines, and evaluated with modality-appropriate controls (e.g., microscopy-only text). Addressing these concerns would substantially improve confidence in the conclusions and elevate the paper’s suitability for a top-tier venue.",

BSS measures correspondence between neighborhood structures in visual and textual embedding spaces, aiming to quantify “semantic alignment” without joint training. The study benchmarks several LLMs and LVMs across TCGA datasets, examining correlations between BSS and downstream retrieval/survival outcomes, as well as inter-LLM agreement. The paper is well motivated and clearly written overall, offering a novel quantitative approach to a relevant gap in multimodal model evaluation.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Conceptual and Theoretical Justification** – The Boltzmann formalism is only loosely grounded; defining energy as Euclidean distance and fixing the temperature term heuristically lacks theoretical clarity. The derivation includes an inconsistency where matched pairs are incorrectly normalized (b=1 instead of p_i/p_q). Clarifying and potentially recalibrating this formulation is critical.  \n2. **Use of Visual Geometry** – The “second-order” factor depends solely on text-space distances, under‐utilizing visual-space structure. Incorporating a weighting that reflects visual similarity could improve representational faithfulness.  \n3. **Experimental Design Clarity** – Retrieval evaluations are ambiguously described, particularly concerning whether retrieval is label-based or feature-based and how data splits prevent leakage. Details on survival analysis (covariates, censoring, and cohort sizes) are also insufficient.  \n4. **Comparisons and Baselines** – The absence of standard structural similarity baselines (e.g., CKA/local-CKA, rank correlation, k-NN overlap) makes it difficult to assess BSS’s distinct advantages.  \n5. **Statistical and Methodological Rigor** – No multiple-testing correction is applied despite numerous correlations, inflating significance risk. Using Cohen’s kappa for rank-based agreement is questionable; Kendall or Spearman correlation would be more appropriate.  \n6. **Reproducibility and Specification** – The definitions of neighbor sets A and D, pairing strategy, and computational complexity should be precisely described, ideally with pseudocode. The sensitivity of BSS to metric choice, k, and normalization should be evaluated.  \n7. **Missing Contextualization** – Related multimodal studies (PathAlign, TITAN, SlideChat) are not discussed; direct comparisons would contextualize what “low BSS” indicates and test whether BSS tracks improvements from explicit multimodal alignment.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Several typos, equation misalignments, and duplicated captions hinder readability.  \n- Figures and tables could highlight statistically significant correlations after correction.  \n- Provide details of LLM embedding extraction (model configuration, pooling, truncation).  \n- Include runtime and scalability discussion for computing BSS on large corpora.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper offers an innovative evaluation concept for cross-modal semantic alignment in pathology and demonstrates thoughtful experimentation across multiple datasets and encoders. Its novelty and breadth are clear strengths, but theoretical rigor and methodological transparency require improvement. Ambiguities in the mathematical formulation, insufficient baselines, and incomplete statistical controls currently limit interpretability of correlations linking BSS to downstream performance. Resolving these issues and situating BSS against established alignment metrics would significantly enhance reliability and impact.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The work is promising and potentially impactful, but it requires stronger theoretical justification, clearer methodological exposition, additional baseline comparisons, and comprehensive statistical validation before acceptance.",

        "text": "# Review Report: Boltzmann Semantic Score: A Semantic Metric for Evaluating Large Vision Models Using Large Language Models\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of evaluating whether Large Vision Models (LVMs) extract medically and semantically relevant features similar to those identified by human experts. Current evaluation methods rely on biased, qualitative approaches with limited expert assessments. The authors propose the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS), a novel metric inspired by state space modeling that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate LVMs by comparing their embedding spaces with those of LLMs applied to pathology reports. Through extensive experiments on 32 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five state-of-the-art LLMs and seven LVMs, the authors first establish LLMs' capability in digital pathology tasks (achieving 0.871 top-1 accuracy in information retrieval) and demonstrate that LLM representations correlate with patient outcomes. Most significantly, they reveal that current LVMs exhibit poor semantic capability (BSS typically below 0.4), indicating a substantial gap between the features extracted by LVMs and the medically relevant information captured in expert pathology reports. The authors further demonstrate statistically significant correlations between BSS and performance in downstream clinical tasks, providing evidence that structural similarity in visual embeddings relates to clinical utility.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n**Major Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses a fundamental and previously underserved problem in medical AI: how to quantitatively evaluate whether LVMs capture medically relevant knowledge rather than just achieving high accuracy on specific tasks\n- The Boltzmann Semantic Score is a theoretically grounded, novel contribution that provides a systematic, quantitative approach to measuring semantic alignment between visual representations and expert medical knowledge\n- The extensive experimental validation across 32 diverse cancer datasets provides robust evidence that current LVMs have poor semantic capability, revealing an important limitation that has implications for clinical deployment\n- The demonstration that LLM representations correlate with patient outcomes (survival prediction) is significant and novel for the field\n- The finding that multiple LLMs show substantial consensus in evaluating LVMs adds credibility to the proposed metric\n\n**Major Limitations:**\n- The paper does not sufficiently explain why the semantic gap exists (why LVMs fail to capture medical semantics) or provide concrete pathways for addressing this limitation\n- The theoretical foundation of BSS would benefit from more rigorous mathematical justification, particularly regarding the choice of k=5 and the specific formulation of the Boltzmann factors\n- The paper lacks direct comparison with existing LVM evaluation methods to establish the relative advantages of BSS as an evaluation metric\n- The clinical implications of the findings could be strengthened with more specific discussion about how BSS could be integrated into practical LVM development and validation workflows\n\n**Minor Strengths:**\n- The experimental design is comprehensive, evaluating multiple LLMs and LVMs across diverse cancer types with multiple validation strategies\n- The paper includes well-designed visualizations and qualitative examples that effectively illustrate key findings\n- The authors provide detailed implementation information and commit to releasing code and data for reproducibility\n- The study establishes for the first time that LLM-processed pathology reports can predict patient outcomes\n\n**Minor Limitations:**\n- Some sections (particularly the methodology) could be more concise to improve readability\n- The paper would benefit from expanded discussion of related work on model interpretability in medical imaging\n- Figure 1 would benefit from more explicit labeling to clarify the relationship between cancer types and clusters\n- The paper could more explicitly identify which specific aspects of medical knowledge LVMs are failing to capture\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a critical challenge in medical AI with high potential impact. The finding that current LVMs exhibit poor semantic alignment with expert knowledge (BSS typically below 0.4) reveals a fundamental limitation that must be addressed before these models can be trusted in clinical settings. This has significant implications for the field's direction, suggesting that current LVMs may capture statistical patterns rather than medically meaningful features.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper introduces the novel Boltzmann Semantic Score, a theoretically grounded metric that represents a significant conceptual innovation. By leveraging LLMs to evaluate LVMs' semantic capability, it moves beyond traditional task-specific performance metrics to assess whether models capture the underlying medical knowledge. The cross-modal evaluation approach using Boltzmann distribution principles is particularly innovative.\n\n**Evaluation:** The paper provides extensive and rigorous evaluation across 32 TCGA cancer datasets using five LLMs and seven LVMs. The experiments include multiple validation strategies (information retrieval, survival prediction, correlation analysis) and demonstrate substantial consensus among different LLMs. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by direct comparison with existing LVM evaluation methods to establish BSS's relative advantages.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides comprehensive implementation details, including code availability, data sources, and experimental procedures. The methodology is described with sufficient detail to enable replication, and the use of standard datasets (TCGA) and publicly available models enhances reproducibility. The authors' commitment to releasing code and processed data further supports reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision (Reject/Resubmit)**\n\nThis paper makes significant contributions to the field by introducing a novel metric for evaluating whether LVMs capture medically relevant knowledge. However, the manuscript requires substantial revisions to address several critical limitations before it can be accepted. The authors should: (1) strengthen the theoretical foundation of BSS with more rigorous mathematical justification, (2) provide direct comparisons with existing evaluation methods to establish BSS's relative advantages, (3) expand the discussion of why the semantic gap exists and how it might be bridged, and (4) provide more concrete pathways for how BSS could be integrated into practical LVM development workflows. The paper's core contributions are valuable and potentially transformative for the field, but these revisions are necessary to fully realize that potential and establish the metric's broader utility. I encourage the authors to address these concerns in a revised submission.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents the *Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS)*, a new metric designed to evaluate whether Large Vision Models (LVMs) capture medically and semantically meaningful features aligned with expert pathology knowledge. Drawing on principles of state space modeling and Boltzmann distributions, the BSS employs Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to pathology reports to assess the semantic alignment of LVM embeddings. The study uses 32 cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), evaluates five LLMs and seven LVMs, and establishes that LLM-derived representations correlate with patient outcomes.

Its experimental breadth—covering diverse datasets, multiple LLMs, and validation tasks—provides solid evidence of current LVM limitations and suggests a meaningful direction for refining future models.

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript explores whether large vision models (LVMs) capture medically and semantically relevant information that is comparable to what is recorded in expert pathology reports. The authors assemble a corpus of more than 9,500 pathology reports drawn from 32 TCGA cancer cohorts and encode the text with five state‑of‑the‑art large language models (LLMs), obtaining dense embeddings. They then propose a new metric – the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS) – to assess structural similarity between the LLM embedding space (treated as the reference) and the LVM embedding space (the observer). BSS is built from k‑nearest‑neighbor graphs together with Boltzmann factors. The experimental portion first evaluates the LLMs on information‑retrieval and survival‑prediction tasks, demonstrating that the resulting textual embeddings correlate with patient outcomes. Afterwards, seven LVMs are examined using BSS, which generally reveals low semantic alignment with the text space. Correlation analyses show that BSS values relate to downstream performance, and the authors also quantify the consensus among the LLMs when ranking the LVMs. The main contribution is the introduction of BSS as a modality‑agnostic, systematic measure of semantic fidelity for visual models using language‑model encodings.  \n\n---  \n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:** The work offers a scalable, quantitative alternative to the labor‑intensive expert visual inspection that is often used to evaluate medical vision models. By providing a way to benchmark LVMs against large collections of pathology reports, the paper addresses a genuine need in digital pathology.  \n\n- **Innovation:** The Boltzmann‑based similarity measure, which operates on k‑nearest‑neighbor graphs of the text and image embedding spaces (see Section 3.3, Figures 2–3), is an original idea. While the formulation is inventive, a stronger theoretical grounding and a clearer comparison with more straightforward cross‑modal metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) would help to highlight its practical advantages.  \n\n- **Evaluation:** The authors make good use of a substantial multi‑cancer dataset (TCGA) and evaluate a diverse set of baselines (five LLMs and seven LVMs). The experiments span two downstream tasks, report Pearson correlations (Table 3), and examine consensus among the LLMs (Figure 7). Nonetheless, many methodological details—such as hyper‑parameter choices, query construction, and statistical correction procedures—are omitted, and the reported BSS values are modest without an explicit interpretation of what constitutes a meaningful magnitude in practice.  \n\n- **Reproducibility:** Although the manuscript states that code and data will be released (Abstract, “Reproducibility Statement”), the provided URL is a placeholder (https://github.com/XXX). The appendix lists software versions (Section E) but does not include complete pipelines, random‑seed specifications, or a detailed description of the report‑perturbation protocol described in Section 4.3.1.  \n\n---  \n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n- **Mathematical clarity:** In Equation 2 the Boltzmann factor combines Euclidean distance with a constant “√ d₁” without justification; the statistical or physical interpretation of this term is not clear (Section 3.3).  \n\n- **Second‑order factor notation:** Equation 3 repeats the term *pᵢ·pᵢ* and does not differentiate between matching and non‑matching states, leading to ambiguous notation and interpretation (Section 3.3).  \n\n- **Choice of *k* in k‑NN graphs:** The default setting *k* = 5 appears arbitrary. Although Figure 8 hints at an ablation over *k*, the manuscript does not present how varying *k* influences BSS values or the correlations reported in Table 3.  \n\n- **Perturbation protocol:** Table 1 presents results for “perturbed” reports, yet the manuscript does not specify which keywords are removed, how many deletions occur per report, or whether the perturbation preserves report length (Section 4.3.1).  \n\n- **Baseline comparisons missing:** No experiments compare BSS against existing cross‑modal similarity measures (e.g., CLIP cosine similarity or simple Euclidean distance). Providing such baselines would make it possible to assess whether BSS truly offers a performance advantage.  \n\n- **Statistical reporting:** The correlation tables (Table 3a, 3b) include p‑values but omit confidence intervals, effect‑size interpretation, and any correction for multiple testing across the 32 cancer types. This omission raises concerns about potential false‑positive findings.  \n\n- **Formatting and readability:** Several tables contain placeholder entries such as “0 ._ ._ 871,” and several figures lack axis labels, legends, and fully informative captions (Tables 1‑8, Figures 4‑7). Improving these elements would greatly aid readers in interpreting the results.  \n\n- **Survival‑prediction baselines:** The reported C‑indices for LLM embeddings (~0.6, Table 2) are not benchmarked against standard clinical prognostic models (e.g., stage‑based models). Consequently, the added predictive value of the embeddings remains uncertain.  \n\n- **Consensus analysis details:** Figure 7 displays pairwise Cohen’s κ values but does not provide absolute numbers, confidence intervals, or statistical testing, which makes the claim of “substantial agreement” harder to evaluate.  \n\n- **Code availability:** The repository link is currently a dummy placeholder. Without access to the BSS implementation, preprocessing scripts, and training pipelines, the reproducibility claim cannot be verified.  \n\n---  \n\n## A suggested decision  \n\nReject  \n\n*Rationale:* The manuscript lacks essential baseline comparisons and comprehensive statistical reporting, which limit confidence in the evaluation (evaluation ≤ 1). Consequently, the current submission does not meet the criteria for acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in assisting radiologists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image interpretation and diagnosis. However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities, leading to ambiguous patient-level pairings. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease (including several most deadly cancers) diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation. In the zero-shot classification task, we achieved an average AUC of 81.3% on 54 diagnosis tasks, surpassing CLIP and supervised methods by 12.9% and 8.0%, respectively. Additionally, on the publicly available CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT benchmarks, our fVLM outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods with absolute AUC gains of 7.4% and 4.8%, respectively.",

Specifically, the architectural integration of 3D image volumes within a ViT base pretrained on ImageNet‑1K is unclear.

Without source code, a more transparent description of the model’s structure is essential for reproducibility.  \n2. **Comparative Evaluation** – The comparisons with 2D CLIP methods (Table 1) and CT‑CLIP models (Table 3) lack sufficient methodological context. It remains ambiguous how 2D CLIP methods were adapted for 3D data and whether CT‑CLIP results involved fine‑tuning on in‑house data or other procedures. These details are necessary to interpret the results fairly.  \n3. **Data Preprocessing** – The HU clipping range (‑300 to 400) may not encompass all relevant abnormalities, especially given the inclusion of both lung (≈ ‑1000 HU) and bone (≈ 1000 HU) regions across different scan phases.

To improve the granularity of alignment the authors propose to pre-segment key anatomical structures in CT using a public segmentation model (Totalsegmenter), and to pre-segment descriptions corresponding to individual anatomical structures in the free-text report using an open-access LLM (Qwen). This allows fine-grained contrastive learning at the anatomical structure level. Considerations are made to avoid pushing representations of the same organ/condition away. Improved performances are shown for zero-shot abnormality detection compared with several existing approaches.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe idea of increasing the granularity of contrastive learning by data pre-segmentation using public tools is neat, simple, and straightforward. \n\nThe paper is written with sufficient clarity, where the insights behind each design and the implementations details are well-presented. \n\nImproved performance on zero-shot abnormality detection is shown compared with some existing works.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nFor a comprehensive assessment of report generation some essential scores are missing, such as BLEU 1-3, ROUGE-L, and METEOR. Also, comparisons with vision encoders from peer vision-language pre-training for CT works may be needed. This is my major concern as the authors have claimed improved performance on report generation task.\n\nDespite improved granularity, attributing sentences of reports `mentioning` a structure to the image feature of that structure may sometimes be misleading especially when manual verification/correction is not accessible. E.g., in practice pancreatitis is often associated with the entire abdomen instead of the pancreas alone and neighboring structures. The authors are encouraged to comment on this.\n\n### Questions\n\nA high-level question: The capability of open-source image segmentation tools (totalsegmenter and/or SAM family) and open-source LLM advance fiercely -- does it imply that the utility of (un-/weakly-supervised) vision-language pretraining for CT will gradually phase out? One may directly construct semantic labels from text reports using strong enough LLM tools and turn the problem back to large scale supervised learning. I am curious to hear the authors’ insight.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nA separate ICLR ethics reviewer might not be needed.

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript addresses fine-grained alignment in vision-language pretraining for CT images and corresponding reports. The authors propose segmenting CT scans into anatomical structures using a public segmentation tool (TotalSegmenter) and segmenting textual descriptions using an open-access large language model (Qwen). The approach enables contrastive learning at the anatomical structure level while minimizing conflicts in representation learning of identical organs or conditions. The paper is clearly written, presenting both conceptual motivation and implementation details effectively. Experiments demonstrate improved zero-shot abnormality detection performance when compared with existing methods.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Evaluation Metrics for Report Generation**: The manuscript claims improved performance on report generation, yet omits common quantitative measures such as BLEU 1–3, ROUGE-L, and METEOR. A complete evaluation including these scores is required to substantiate this claim.  \n2. **Comparative Analysis**: The study would benefit from direct comparison with vision encoders from peer vision-language pretraining approaches for CT. This comparison is important to contextualize the proposed method’s advantages.  \n3. **Attribution Accuracy**: Although the method aims for fine-grained alignment, assigning report sentences mentioning an anatomical structure directly to that structure’s image features may be unreliable. Certain clinical findings (e.g., pancreatitis) relate to broader regions rather than single organs. Clarification of how such ambiguities are handled—or a discussion of potential misalignment—would strengthen the work.  \n4. **Long-Term Utility of the Approach**: Given the rapid progress of open-source segmentation and large language models, the necessity of unsupervised or weakly supervised pretraining for CT data may diminish. The authors are encouraged to address this strategic question and provide perspectives on future relevance.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Ensure ethical approval and compliance with data protection regulations are clearly stated, given the involvement of human CT data.  \n- Minor editorial refinement could further improve readability and flow.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper introduces a simple yet effective approach to enhancing alignment granularity in CT-based vision-language pretraining. The technical presentation and design rationale are clear, and empirical improvements are demonstrated. However, the quantitative evaluation for report generation and comparisons with related pretraining models are incomplete, and the attribution scheme warrants deeper clarification regarding its clinical validity. Addressing these concerns would considerably strengthen the manuscript.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**: **Major Revision**",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI** –  \nThe paper primarily contributes a *methodological innovation* in medical imaging AI: a new **fine‑grained vision–language pre‑training strategy (fVLM)** for CT image understanding. It tackles anatomical‑level image–report alignment and advances multimodal learning beyond global CLIP‑style pairing. This fits well within *TMI*’s scope on imaging methodology (image reconstruction, representation learning, quantitative analysis, and AI interpretability).\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level** –  \nThe work extends foundations of medical vision–language modeling with (i) explicit anatomy‑level alignment rather than implicit attention, and (ii) a dual false‑negative reduction and co‑teaching scheme. Given the novelty of anatomical parsing and disease‑aware contrastive objectives for 3‑D CT data, the paper exceeds incremental improvement. However, its conceptual originality lies mainly in adapting and integrating known components (segmentation‑based locality, CLIP‑style loss, co‑teaching) rather than entirely new theory. It demonstrates strong empirical advancement.\n\n3. **Technical & Experimental Rigor** –  \nThe study uses a very large in‑house dataset (69 k patients, 272 k CTs) with report parsing via LLMs and external validation on CT‑RATE and Rad‑ChestCT. Ablation, scaling, and visualization analyses are sound. Details of preprocessing, annotation, and statistical significance testing are only partly shown in appendices; clarity on IRB approval and specific error analysis could be improved.  \n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation** –  \nThe manuscript is clearly written, with logical structure, extensive comparisons, and readable figures/tables. Minor language polishing would help (grammar, figure referencing, shorthand consistency).  \n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance** –  \nDataset creation claims anonymization but does not explicitly mention institutional ethics approval or data‑sharing policy for MedVL‑CT69K. Code availability is stated via GitHub. The use of LLMs (Qwen 2.5) for report parsing should confirm that no protected health information was exposed externally.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \nThis paper introduces **fVLM**, a fine‑grained vision–language pre‑training framework for 3‑D CT image interpretation. It segments CT volumes into 36 grouped anatomies, decomposes clinical reports into corresponding anatomical sentences using LLM‑driven parsing, and performs per‑anatomy contrastive learning. To mitigate false negatives in contrastive objectives, the authors design a *dual false‑negative correction* that accounts for normal–normal and disease‑consistent samples, implemented via a co‑teaching scheme between two models. Evaluations on a newly built large‑scale dataset (MedVL‑CT69K) and public benchmarks show improved zero‑shot and report‑generation performance over CLIP and prior medical VLMs.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n- Ambitious and timely topic: large‑scale, multimodal CT foundation modeling.  \n- Methodologically more granular than existing VLMs, improving interpretability.  \n- Comprehensive experiments, including ablations, scaling analyses, and multi‑dataset validation.  \n- Demonstrates credible quantitative gains (≈ 8–13 AUC points) and qualitative improvements in attention localization.  \n- Public code release enhances reproducibility.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n- Novelty is somewhat incremental (integration of established ideas) rather than theoretical breakthrough.  \n- Heavy reliance on an internal dataset; lack of detailed description of patient cohort, scanner diversity, and ethical oversight.  \n- The dual false‑negative and co‑teaching strategy needs stronger mathematical or empirical justification (hyperparameter sensitivity, convergence).  \n- Report decomposition via LLMs may introduce unquantified errors; no inter‑annotator or parsing accuracy analysis reported.  \n- Limited discussion of computational cost and inference efficiency for clinical deployment.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n1. **Dataset Ethics and Generalizability:** Provide explicit approval or de‑identification description for MedVL‑CT69K and clarify whether the data can be publicly released or partially shared.  \n2. **Quantitative Robustness:** Add confidence intervals or statistical tests for improvements (AUC gains) across tasks and anatomies.  \n3. **LLM‑Based Report Parsing:** Quantify parsing accuracy against a radiologist‑verified subset; discuss robustness to differing report templates.  \n4. **False‑Negative Reduction:** Offer an intuition or analytic analysis of how the label‑correction weighting (α = 0.5) affects training stability; consider providing ablation over α.  \n5. **Computational Efficiency:** Report GPU hours and inference speed, comparing to CT‑CLIP or Merlin, as this informs clinical scalability.  \n6. **Visualization/Interpretability:** Include qualitative examples illustrating where fVLM improves localization relative to CLIP in 3‑D context.\n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n- Check typographical inconsistencies (e.g., “ﬁndings/impression,” “Spec/Sens”).  \n- Ensure figure legends are self‑contained.  \n- Reference numbering for certain works (e.g., duplicate Lin 2023) should be verified.  \n- Clarify abbreviations in tables (GREEN, CoT).  \n- Provide full specification of training hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate).  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation** – **Major Revision**\n\n*Justification:* The study demonstrates clear methodological and experimental promise highly relevant to *TMI*, but key clarifications on ethical compliance, dataset transparency, and deeper analysis of the proposed modules are necessary before publication.\n\n7. **Confidence Level** – **4 / 5** (High confidence in technical assessment; limited access to supplementary ethics details)\n\n---\n\n**Guidance to the Authors:**  \nTo elevate the paper to *TMI* standards, emphasize methodological insight—formalize the false‑negative correction, validate report parsing quantitatively, and provide transparency on dataset governance. Strengthening theoretical motivation and reproducibility documentation would make fVLM a strong contribution within the medical imaging methodology community.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper proposes fVLM, a fine-grained vision-language model for CT image understanding that addresses misalignment issues in existing CLIP-based approaches. The method performs anatomy-level alignment between CT scan regions and corresponding radiology report descriptions, rather than global image-report contrastive learning. The approach uses TotalSegmentator to parse anatomical structures (Section 3.1, Page 4) and employs LLMs to decompose reports into anatomy-specific descriptions (Figure 2, Page 4). To handle false negatives arising from abundant normal samples and similar pathologies, the authors introduce a dual false negative reduction strategy with co-teaching (Section 3.3, Pages 6-7). The method is evaluated on MedVL-CT69K, a curated dataset of 272,124 CT scans from 69,086 patients. Results show fVLM achieves 81.3% average AUC across 54 disease diagnosis tasks, outperforming CLIP by 12.9% and supervised methods by 8.0% (Table 1, Page 8). Additional evaluations on CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT benchmarks demonstrate 7.4% and 4.8% absolute AUC improvements respectively (Table 2, Page 9).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - The similarity calculation in Equation 1 (Page 6) uses inconsistent notation where Nj represents \"number of structurally complete samples\" but the summation indices suggest batch-level operations, creating confusion about the actual computation scope\n  - The loss function in Equation 2 lacks clear definition of what constitutes \"structurally complete samples\" and how this affects gradient computation across anatomies with different sample counts\n  - The co-teaching formulation in Equation 3 (Page 7) sets α=0.5 empirically without theoretical justification or sensitivity analysis, undermining the mathematical rigor of the approach\n\n• **Insufficient experimental validation and evaluation gaps**\n  - The dataset split details show only 1,151 validation patients versus 64,476 training patients (Page 8), representing an unusually small validation set that may not provide reliable model selection and hyperparameter tuning\n  - The comparison with radiologists is relegated to \"Appendix A.3\" (Page 9) without presenting quantitative results in the main paper, limiting assessment of clinical relevance\n  - Missing ablation studies on key architectural choices such as the grouping of 104 anatomical regions into 36 categories (Section 3.1, Page 4), which directly impacts the core fine-grained alignment capability\n\n• **Technical approach limitations and methodological concerns**\n  - The reliance on TotalSegmentator for anatomy parsing (Figure 2, Page 4) introduces potential error propagation from segmentation failures, but no analysis is provided on how segmentation quality affects downstream performance\n  - The report decomposition using LLMs with string-matching fallback (Section 3.1, Page 5) lacks quantitative evaluation of decomposition accuracy, which is critical since misaligned text-image pairs would undermine the entire training objective\n  - The false negative identification strategy assumes anatomies not mentioned in impression sections are normal (Page 7), but this heuristic may not hold across different reporting styles or institutions, potentially introducing systematic biases\n\n• **Experimental design and reproducibility concerns**\n  - The co-teaching strategy employs \"different model initialization, data iteration sequences and augmentations\" (Page 8) for model diversity, but these implementation details are not specified, hindering reproducibility\n  - The MedVL-CT69K dataset curation process lacks details about data quality control, institutional diversity, or potential selection biases that could affect generalizability\n  - The zero-shot evaluation setup does not clearly specify how disease categories were defined or annotated, particularly for the 54 diseases across 15 anatomies mentioned in the abstract but not fully detailed until appendix references\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation clarity**\n  - Clearly define Nj in Equation 1 and specify whether it represents per-anatomy sample counts or batch-level indices, and provide explicit algorithmic descriptions for handling variable anatomy presence across samples\n  - Add theoretical analysis or empirical sensitivity study for the α=0.5 choice in Equation 3, demonstrating robustness to this hyperparameter selection\n  - Include formal definitions of \"structurally complete samples\" and provide computational complexity analysis for the anatomy-specific contrastive learning framework\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation with comprehensive baselines**\n  - Increase validation set size or provide justification for the current split, and include cross-validation results to demonstrate model stability across different data partitions\n  - Present quantitative radiologist comparison results in the main paper with statistical significance testing and inter-rater agreement analysis\n  - Add comprehensive ablation studies on anatomical grouping strategies, comparing performance across different granularity levels from 104 regions to various grouping schemes\n\n• **Address technical limitations with robust evaluation**\n  - Quantitatively evaluate TotalSegmentator segmentation quality on the dataset and analyze correlation between segmentation accuracy and final model performance\n  - Develop and report metrics for report decomposition quality, potentially using expert annotations on a subset to validate LLM-based anatomy extraction accuracy\n  - Test the impression-section heuristic across different institutions or report templates, and provide alternative strategies for normal case identification\n\n• **Improve experimental design and ensure reproducibility**\n  - Provide complete implementation details for the co-teaching diversity strategies, including specific augmentation types, initialization schemes, and iteration order variations\n  - Include detailed dataset curation methodology with quality control measures, institutional sources, and potential bias analysis\n  - Clearly specify disease annotation protocols and provide inter-annotator agreement statistics for the 54 disease categories, with detailed breakdown by anatomy type",

The proposed method aims to address the limitations of existing global contrastive learning approaches by performing fine-grained alignment at the anatomy level, which is crucial for capturing clinically relevant details. The authors claim that their model outperforms existing methods on both zero-shot classification tasks and downstream report generation tasks, achieving significant improvements in AUC and other metrics. The manuscript is well-written and provides a comprehensive evaluation across a large dataset and multiple anatomies.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the proposed fine-grained alignment approach is innovative, the manuscript could benefit from a more thorough discussion of how it compares to existing methods that also attempt to align images and reports at finer levels. The authors should clarify how their method differs from recent works that also focus on anatomy-level alignment and provide a more detailed comparison.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily conducted on a large in-house dataset (MedVL-CT69K), which is commendable for its size and diversity. However, the authors should consider extending the evaluation to more diverse datasets or real-world clinical scenarios to better validate the model's generalizability. Additionally, the inclusion of more qualitative analyses, such as case studies or reader studies involving radiologists, would strengthen the manuscript.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares the proposed method against several baselines, including CLIP and other vision-language models. However, the choice of baselines seems somewhat arbitrary.

The reproducibility of the method is somewhat compromised by the lack of detailed methodological descriptions. Overall, while the manuscript has substantial merit, it requires additional validation and clarification to fully meet the standards expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision.

Please provide quantitative assessments (e.g., mask Dice vs a labeled subset; precision/recall for anatomy assignment and text extraction vs radiologist ground truth) and an analysis of how errors in either component affect downstream performance.\n- How is inference performed for zero-shot diagnosis—does it require running TotalSegmentator per study? What is the end-to-end latency and GPU memory footprint? Can masks be precomputed or approximated (e.g., coarse ROI pooling), and what is the performance impact?\n- The heuristic “not mentioned in impression implies normal” is strong. What fraction of anatomies per report fall into this category, and what is the estimated false-normal rate when audited by radiologists? Have you tried alternatives like semantic-positive mining (text–text similarity) or SigLIP-style multi-positive soft targets?\n- The metrics in Table 1 appear inconsistent (e.g., F1 greatly exceeding precision; some AUCs equal 1.00). Could you clarify definitions (macro vs micro vs weighted), thresholding, and fix any tabulation errors? Please add CIs and per-class support to interpret very high AUCs.\n- How sensitive are results to the grouping from 104 regions to 36 anatomies? Did you try different grouping granularities, and how do they trade off batch balance, alignment quality, and final AUC?\n- What zero-shot prompts were used for disease detection across the 54 tasks? Please provide exact templates, handling of negation/uncertainty, and any prompt ensemble or calibration techniques.\n- Can you report comparisons to multi-positive/soft-negative objectives (e.g., SigLIP or RoCo) and semantic-positive mining (as in FaNe or MedCLIP) within your pipeline, to isolate the benefit of co-teaching specifically?\n- For report generation, how was the diagnostic extractor validated, and is there any risk of overlap with training data for the generative model? Could you share results using human evaluation or GREEN with radiologist annotations on a subset?\n- Is code and a smaller reproducible subset planned for release? The current link is a placeholder; concrete timelines and artifacts would help the community build upon this work.\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper tackles an important limitation of global CT VLPs by introducing anatomy-level alignment and explicit false-negative mitigation, yielding strong zero-shot results in- and out-of-distribution. The approach is well-motivated and technically sound in concept, and the empirical improvements are promising. However, several aspects need tightening before publication at a top-tier venue: rigorous validation of the segmentation and LLM decomposition steps, clearer and statistically robust reporting (including resolving metric inconsistencies and providing CIs), and stronger positioning against recent methods that also address false negatives and local alignment. Additional analyses on robustness (mask/decomposition noise), inference cost, and sensitivity to anatomy grouping would further strengthen the contribution. With these clarifications and expanded comparisons, the work has solid potential to become a reference for fine-grained CT vision–language pretraining.",

        "text": "# Review Report: LARGE-SCALE AND FINE-GRAINED VISION-LANGUAGE PRE-TRAINING FOR ENHANCED CT IMAGE UNDERSTANDING\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses a critical limitation in current vision-language models (VLMs) for medical imaging: the coarse global alignment between entire CT images and radiology reports, which fails to capture the localized associations between specific anatomical regions and corresponding diagnostic descriptions. The authors propose fVLM, a fine-grained vision-language model that explicitly matches anatomical regions in CT scans with their corresponding report descriptions through anatomy-level decomposition and contrastive pre-training. To overcome the false negative challenges inherent in fine-grained alignment, they introduce a dual false negative reduction module that identifies and corrects misaligned pairs from both normal and abnormal samples. The authors curate MedVL-CT69K, the largest CT dataset to date comprising 272,124 scans from 69,086 patients, and demonstrate that fVLM achieves 81.3% average AUC on 54 disease diagnosis tasks, outperforming CLIP by 12.9% and supervised methods by 8.0%. The model also shows significant improvements (7.4% and 4.8% absolute AUC gains) on the CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT benchmarks, respectively, while maintaining strong performance in downstream report generation tasks.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n**Major Strengths:**\n- The fine-grained anatomy-level alignment approach directly addresses a fundamental limitation of current medical VLMs that use global image-report contrastive learning, which is well-motivated by the clinical reality that radiology reports document findings at the anatomy level.\n- The dual false negative reduction module is a thoughtful solution to the significant challenge of handling semantically similar samples in fine-grained alignment, with the co-teaching strategy effectively mitigating error accumulation.\n- The creation of MedVL-CT69K, the largest CT dataset with paired images and reports to date, represents a valuable resource for the medical AI community and enables comprehensive evaluation across 54 disease tasks.\n\n**Major Concerns:**\n- The paper relies heavily on LLMs (Qwen 2.5) for report decomposition but does not provide a quantitative analysis of the error rate in this critical preprocessing step. Without understanding the accuracy of anatomy-specific description extraction, it's difficult to assess how much the model performance depends on this potentially noisy component.\n- The requirement for detailed anatomical segmentation masks via Totalsegmentator adds significant computational overhead and may limit clinical applicability, as this segmentation step is not part of standard radiology workflows. The paper should better justify this design choice and discuss potential alternatives.\n- While the paper claims to be \"annotation-free,\" it still depends on human-generated radiology reports, which represent a form of expensive annotation. The paper should more clearly acknowledge this limitation and discuss the practical implications.\n\n**Minor Comments:**\n- The clinical relevance of the 54 specific disease tasks could be better explained - which conditions are most critical in practice, and how does fVLM's performance vary across clinically significant versus less critical conditions?\n- The reader study with radiologists is mentioned but lacks sufficient detail in the main text; expanding this would strengthen the clinical validation.\n- The visualization in Figure 1(e) is compelling but would benefit from highlighting which anatomies show the most significant improvement over CLIP to better illustrate the value of fine-grained alignment.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a fundamental limitation in medical VLMs that has practical implications for clinical deployment. By enabling more precise alignment between image regions and diagnostic descriptions, fVLM has the potential to improve both diagnostic accuracy and model interpretability in radiology - addressing a critical need in medical AI. The demonstrated performance improvements on clinically relevant tasks, including outperforming supervised methods in zero-shot settings, underscore the potential clinical impact.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper presents a clear conceptual advancement over existing approaches. The anatomy-level fine-grained contrastive learning framework is novel and well-motivated, representing a meaningful departure from global alignment strategies. The dual false negative reduction module with co-teaching is an innovative solution to a previously unaddressed challenge in fine-grained medical VLMs. The approach advances the field beyond simply scaling existing methods to creating more clinically relevant representations.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is generally thorough, with comprehensive results across multiple datasets (MedVL-CT69K, CT-RATE, Rad-ChestCT) and tasks (abnormality detection, report generation). The ablation studies provide insight into the contribution of each component. However, the evaluation would benefit from more detailed error analysis (e.g., which anatomies/diseases benefit most from fine-grained alignment) and deeper exploration of failure cases. The report generation results, while positive, don't fully leverage the anatomy-specific capabilities of the model.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides reasonable detail about the method and shares code, which is positive. However, several key aspects need clarification for full reproducibility: specific hyperparameters for the false negative correction, complete description of the anatomy grouping strategy (beyond referencing Appendix Table 6), and computational resources required for training. The dependency on LLM-based report decomposition requires more detailed implementation specifications to ensure consistent results across different environments.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision**\n\nThe paper presents a significant advancement in medical vision-language modeling with strong technical merit and promising results. However, the concerns regarding the LLM-based report decomposition process, the clinical applicability of the segmentation requirement, and the need for more thorough error analysis and clinical relevance discussion require substantial revisions. The authors should provide quantitative analysis of the report decomposition accuracy, more detailed clinical validation, and clearer discussion of practical implementation considerations before this work can be recommended for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. These revisions would strengthen the paper's contribution and better establish the clinical relevance and robustness of the proposed approach.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the problem of coarse‑grained image‑text alignment in CT‐based artificial intelligence by exploiting radiology reports as supervisory signals. To this end the authors assemble a large collection—272 124 CT examinations from 69 086 patients with accompanying reports—named MedVL‑CT69K, and define 54 diagnostic tasks spanning 15 anatomical regions. Their proposed fine‑grained vision‑language model (fVLM) aligns segmented anatomical structures with the corresponding sentences in the report, performs contrastive pre‑training separately for each anatomy, and incorporates a dual false‑negative reduction (FNR) component that distinguishes normal from abnormal pairs via a co‑teaching scheme. In a series of zero‑shot experiments on the curated dataset the model attains an average AUC of 81.3 % across the diagnostic tasks. The authors present this as a scalable, annotation‑free framework that furnishes anatomy‑level image‑text correspondence for CT data.  \n\n---  \n\n## General feedback  \n\n*Significance.*  The paper addresses an acknowledged limitation of many medical vision‑language models, namely the lack of fine‑grained anatomical grounding, and therefore proposes a direction that could improve interpretability and downstream utility.  \n\n*Innovation.*  The explicit anatomy‑level matching and the dual FNR/co‑teaching mechanism constitute a novel extension of existing global‑contrastive and implicit local‑alignment approaches (see Sec. 2.2).  \n\n*Evaluation.*  The authors report extensive zero‑shot results on an internal dataset and two public benchmarks, and also include a report‑generation experiment. However, the presentation omits statistical significance testing, per‑disease breakdowns, and comparisons with strong supervised baselines, which limits the interpretability of the reported gains.  \n\n*Reproducibility.*  While code is made available, many essential details—including the anatomy‑grouping strategy, the LLM prompting pipeline, random‑crop handling, and the hyper‑parameters—are relegated to the supplementary material. Moreover, the MedVL‑CT69K dataset is proprietary, hindering independent replication.  \n\n---  \n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n1. **Dataset claim.**  The statement that MedVL‑CT69K is “the largest CT dataset to date” (Sec. 4.1) is unsupported. A quantitative comparison with existing public resources such as LIDC‑IDRI or TCIA, together with a citation or a summary table, is required to substantiate this claim.  \n\n2. **Report decomposition.**  Section 3.1 relies on a proprietary large‑language‑model prompt pipeline to split reports into anatomy‑specific sentences. The manuscript offers no assessment of how sensitive the downstream alignment is to variations in prompts or to updates of the underlying LLM. An ablation or robustness analysis would be essential.  \n\n3. **False‑negative reduction assumption.**  The FNR component assumes that the absence of a given anatomy in the *impression* section indicates a normal finding (Fig. 4). In practice many radiology reports simply omit normal statements, which could lead to systematic mislabeling of abnormal cases as normal. The paper lacks an error analysis quantifying the impact of this assumption.  \n\n4. **Training hyper‑parameters.**  Critical settings such as learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and the contrastive temperature τ are buried in Appendix A.2. For transparency these should be summarized in the main text, preferably in a concise table.  \n\n5. **Table 1 presentation.**  The current formatting (e.g., “~~68.4~~”, “~~**81.3**~~”) obscures the actual numbers and precludes evaluation of variance or statistical significance. A clean table with clear values and confidence intervals is needed.  \n\n6. **Statistical reporting of AUCs.**  Zero‑shot AUC improvements are presented without accompanying 95 % confidence intervals or hypothesis tests. Providing such statistics would allow readers to judge whether the observed differences are meaningful.  \n\n7. **Report‑generation metrics.**  Table 3 mixes an undefined “GREEN” score with standard natural‑language‑generation metrics. The manuscript should briefly define GREEN, explain why it is relevant, and compare it to established metrics.  \n\n8. **Scaling‑law analysis.**  Figure 5 depicts performance versus dataset size, yet the description does not explain how the data subsets were constructed nor whether training hyper‑parameters were kept constant across scales. Without this information the scaling experiment cannot be reproduced.  \n\n9. **Ethical considerations.**  The manuscript does not discuss patient privacy, consent, or Institutional Review Board approval for the MedVL‑CT69K dataset. Given the clinical nature of the data, a thorough ethical statement is mandatory.  \n\n10. **Reader study.**  Section 4.2 mentions a reader study comparing fVLM output to board‑certified radiologists, but provides no quantitative results, study design details, or statistical analysis. This omission weakens any claim of clinical relevance.  \n\n---  \n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\n*Rationale.*  The work raises serious ethical concerns related to patient privacy and consent that are not addressed, and the methodological limitations outlined above prevent the results from being considered reliable or reproducible.

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript investigates coarse‑grained image–text alignment in CT‑based artificial intelligence, aiming to establish anatomy‑level correspondence between radiology images and report sentences. The authors construct a large‑scale dataset (MedVL‑CT69K) comprising 272 124 CT studies from 69 086 patients and define 54 diagnostic tasks across 15 anatomical regions. A fine‑grained vision‑language model (fVLM) is proposed that links segmented anatomies to textual descriptions using contrastive pre‑training for each region and a dual false‑negative reduction (FNR) mechanism based on co‑teaching to separate normal from abnormal examples. The manuscript claims scalability and annotation‑free supervision and demonstrates zero‑shot performance averaging 81.3 % AUC. The work is generally clear and addresses a pertinent limitation of existing medical vision‑language models, though key methodological and ethical details are insufficiently developed.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Significance and Novelty:** The paper advances fine‑grained anatomical grounding through explicit region‑level alignment and a dual FNR/co‑teaching scheme. However, comparative evaluation with robust supervised baselines is lacking, making it difficult to assess real performance gains.  \n2. **Dataset Claims:** The assertion that MedVL‑CT69K is the largest CT dataset is unsubstantiated. Quantitative comparisons with prior public datasets and supporting references or a summary table are required.  \n3. **LLM‑Based Report Decomposition:** The proprietary prompting procedure used to generate anatomy‑specific sentences is insufficiently validated; sensitivity analysis or ablations are needed to assess robustness to prompt or model variations.  \n4. **FNR Assumption:** Inferring normality from the omission of anatomical mentions may cause systematic mislabeling. An error analysis quantifying the resulting bias is necessary.  \n5. **Evaluation Design:** Missing statistical significance tests, per‑disease breakdowns, and 95 % confidence intervals for reported AUCs weaken interpretability.  \n6. **Reproducibility:** Key hyper‑parameters (learning rate, batch size, epochs, temperature) are only in the appendix. Including them in the main text would improve transparency.  \n7. **Reporting and Metrics:** The formatting of results tables obscures real values; GREEN metric lacks definition and justification; scaling‑law construction details are absent. These should be clarified to enable replication.  \n8. **Ethics and Clinical Validation:** No discussion of patient privacy, consent, or institutional review approval is provided. The described reader study lacks quantitative results and design detail, limiting credibility of clinical claims.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Ensure clean numerical tables with defined confidence intervals.  \n- State whether training settings were held constant in scaling experiments.  \n- Provide concise definitions for all metrics and acronyms.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis study proposes an anatomically grounded vision‑language model for CT interpretation, supported by a large internal dataset and an alignment‑oriented training approach. The work’s conceptual direction is promising, but the absence of statistical rigor, critical implementation details, and transparency about ethical oversight undermines the claimed contributions. Without clearer methodological validation and explicit ethical review, reproducibility and reliability remain questionable.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Reject.** The manuscript contains unresolved ethical concerns and lacks sufficient experimental transparency and statistical substantiation to support its conclusions.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot medical detection can further improve detection performance without relying on annotated medical images even upon the fine-tuned model, showing great clinical value. Recent studies leverage grounded vision-language models (GLIP) to achieve this by using detailed disease descriptions as prompts for the target disease name during the inference phase.  \nHowever, these methods typically treat prompts as equivalent context to the target name, making it difficult to assign specific disease knowledge based on visual information, leading to a coarse alignment between images and target descriptions. In this paper, we propose StructuralGLIP, which introduces an auxiliary branch to encode prompts into a latent knowledge bank layer-by-layer, enabling more context-aware and fine-grained alignment. Specifically, in each layer, we select highly similar features from both the image representation and the knowledge bank, forming structural representations that capture nuanced relationships between image patches and target descriptions. These features are then fused across modalities to further enhance detection performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that StructuralGLIP achieves a +4.1\\% AP improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods across seven zero-shot medical detection benchmarks, and consistently improves fine-tuned models by +3.2\\% AP on endoscopy image datasets.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a zero-shot object detection model, StructrualGLIP, for medical image-based object detection tasks. The method uses a knowledge bank that stores encoded text prompts, which are later used to select and match relevant image features to form fine-grained structural representations to allow better alignment of image features with the prompt information, achieving accurate, context-aware detection.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. the paper demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of four medical image modalities.\n2. the paper's representation and structure are mostly clear and easy to follow (although with some language and word choice issues, which will be discussed below).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The claimed novelty appears to be on the latent knowledge bank and its function to store encoded prompt tokens and later be used at each encoder layer as a vision token selector and vice versa. This is coined as a mutual selection process. The selected information is then merged into the original image and text encoder back at each layer. The entire process is different to a standard contextual prompt method (Fig. 1(a)) but it feels like a quite incremental difference which I don't see much novelty.\n2. The word choice of \"medical detection\" bugs me, in medical science detection refers to \"detecting diseases\" whereas here this is object detection in medical images so this may cause confusion to certain readers.\n3. Line 234 looks unfinished.\n4. Eq. 6&7, perhaps the Top-P/Q^{max} function can be simplified by using argmax/argsort function?\n5. L201/534: \"... fine-grained alignment between target descriptions and medical images\", L:256 \"forming fine-grained structural representations\", can the authors clarify what \"fine-grained\" refers to in those places?\n6. L294: \"...like BLIP Li et al. (2022a)\", is the VQA model BLIP or not? Have you considered other VQA models and would the performance of other VQA models fluctuate your detection results?\n7. L177: I don't entirely agree that zero-shot detection has a real-world clinical need as the clinicians I've encountered would not trust zero-shot settings, in the medical domain, accurate detection/segmentation/diagnosis is the the most important thing.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease address Weaknesses #1,5,6.\n\n\n------------------\n04/12/2024:\nI thank the authors' detailed responses. Since the reviewer's post deadline has passed so I am writing my final comments here. \n\nMy conclusion is that I will retain my original score. I believe the paper should improve clarity as many new arguments and technical details surfaced during the discussion period which should have been included in the main manuscript. The novelty and settings should be explored in more depth.\n\nMy comments are:\n\n1. Novelty. \n\nI agree with the authors' argument the image and language encoders do not need to be fine-tuned in your zero-shot detection setting. This I already mentioned in my last comment: \"I can understand if the auxiliary branch's language encoder is untrained\". My question was whether the modules in Eq. 8 to 10 need training or not? Especially the MHA module in Eq. 8, GLIP has the X-MHA module, did the author reuse the X-MHA weights for the MHA without retraining? The authors mentioned in L263 \"we employ a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism\" which reads like it is a new module by the authors' own design. Given an MHA module (as far as I know) should have learnable weights but the authors claim the zero-shot detection setting is training-free, then I find the logic here is contradicted. Furthermore, the authors quoted L210 to demonstrate the training-free paradigm, but that is immediately after Eq.4 and the sentence only describes the encoders. This is an imprecise response to my question so I'm not making a judgment here, but this does make me think the paper should improve clarity. \n\nThe above was not the main point of my original novelty concern, but a spin-off. My original point was that if the authors wanted to demonstrate the \"preventing/addressing domain shifting\" argument for the novelty, you should consider measuring the actual feature distribution difference between GLIP and StructureGLIP.  The authors revealed in the last comments that the domain referred to the features before RPN, and that is what I think you should demonstrate. To recap the authors' comments, the authors claimed the other methods would concatenate prompt so the feature to RPN becomes CLS token of [target_name, prompt] which causes the domain shift, whereas StructualGLIP did the prompts integration in early layers so StructuralGLIP only has CLS of [target_name] to the RPN, and that addresses the domain shift. Conceptually, maybe it is true but please provide empirical evidence. The final performance is a surrogate measure, which does not directly support your domain shift argument. Finally, StructrualGLIP also fuses additional information in the process, so the CLS token should exhibit some domain shift as you are trying to do domain adaptation, these two arguments also have contradictions to each other. \n\nRegarding the \"addressing noise prompt\" argument, I'd imagine the top-P/Q has a certain capability of limiting noise prompts as you only choose the top tokens, so even when you add more prompts, they won't be selected if the network was already trained to have higher attention for the target classes tokens, but that on the other hand, make it trivial argument rather than a novelty.\n\n7. Zero-shot enhancement. After reading the authors' most recent comments, I strongly feel the setting should not be called zero-shot. When the target dataset's labelled data are already used to fine-tune your GLIP base model, then this is weakly supervised. In L175-176, the authors state \"We propose a zero-shot enhancement setting. This involves fine-tuning the model on medical datasets first, and then using prompts to further improve performance on unseen medical images\", initially I considered this as the model was trained on relevant datasets such as same/similar imaging modalities but different tasks or different datasets. However, if the target dataset itself was used for finetuning for training, then the \"further improve performance on unseen medical images\" does not hold.\n\nOther comments:\nThe experiments I requested were for the understanding of how much performance gain was attributable to the design/novelty of StructrualGLIP, i.e., the introduction of the auxiliary branch. The zero-shot enhancement setting (i.e., fine-tuned GLIP) has boosted the performance by a larger margin than the StructualGLIP can bring to GLIP. Also, the choice of the VQA can sometimes affect the AP/AP50 by a noticeable margin (i.e., that 75 AP) but it appears not stable. Then, at least for me, the viability of zero-shot medical detection unfortunately remains questionable.\n\nOnce again I appreciate the authors' effort to address my comments but I'm sorry I will retain my original score based on my thoughts above. The authors are encouraged to delve into the details of the novelty and concepts as well as improve clarity of the manuscript.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The paper offers clear organization and extensive experimentation, although certain terminological and clarity issues remain.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and Conceptual Clarity**: The proposed mutual selection process via a latent knowledge bank differs only incrementally from existing contextual prompt methods. The conceptual novelty is limited and requires stronger justification through empirical evidence or new insights.  \n2. **Zero-Shot Definition and Setting**: The description of the “zero-shot enhancement” setting is inconsistent. Since the GLIP base model is fine-tuned on target datasets, the approach would more accurately be described as weakly supervised rather than zero-shot.  \n3. **Training-Free Logic**: The use of multi-head attention (MHA) modules (Eq. 8–10) raises logical contradictions with the claimed training-free paradigm, as such modules typically include learnable parameters. Clarification on whether pretrained weights are reused is needed.  \n4. **Domain Shift Argument**: The authors claim that StructuralGLIP mitigates domain shift by fusing prompts early in the pipeline, yet no empirical evidence is provided to quantify feature distribution changes. Demonstrating this would solidify the claimed contribution.  \n5. **Evaluation and Experimental Interpretation**: Additional experiments isolating the contribution of the proposed auxiliary branch would clarify how much improvement stems from StructuralGLIP itself versus the fine-tuning process. The variable influence of the VQA model on metrics (AP, AP50) also warrants clarification.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The term *“medical detection”* should be revised to avoid confusion with *disease detection*.  \n- Line 234 appears incomplete.  \n- Equations 6–7 might be simplified using standard `argmax` or `argsort` operations.  \n- The meaning of “fine-grained” in several cited lines (201, 256, 534) should be clarified.  \n- Clarify whether BLIP is indeed the VQA model used and discuss the effect of alternative VQA choices.  \n- Minor language and word-choice issues remain and should be polished for fluency.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper is well structured and demonstrates thorough evaluation across four imaging modalities. However, the conceptual originality of the mutual selection mechanism and the coherence of the “zero-shot” formulation are questioned. The logical consistency of the training-free claim and the lack of empirical evidence on domain adaptation weaken the methodological justification. While the topic is relevant and the experiments comprehensive, important clarifications and deeper analyses are necessary to strengthen the contribution.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The manuscript requires substantial clarification of novelty claims, the zero-shot setting, and experimental validation before it can be considered for acceptance.",

One of the major problem of the proposed method is not trainable as the Top-K selection operation is non-differentiable, while previous work is differentiable and thus finetuning would result in better performance.

The manuscript fits well within the IEEE TMI scope (image reconstruction, learning‑based detection, quantitative analysis).\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe idea of embedding prompts into a hierarchical latent memory and dynamically selecting sub‑tokens for cross‑modal fusion goes beyond prior GLIP or prompt‑pool methods.  Extending “zero‑shot” to a *zero‑shot‑enhancement* setting for fine‑tuned detectors is also new.  Novelty is therefore moderate‑to‑high for TMI standards.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe theoretical description is detailed and mathematically consistent.  Experiments cover eight heterogeneous imaging datasets with multiple baselines, including ablations on hyperparameters P/Q, fusion‑layer choice, prompt noise, and LLM type.  However, quantitative significance tests and runtime/complexity analyses are missing, and reproducibility details (code, pretrained weights, IRB where needed) should be clarified.\n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nWriting quality is good overall, though the manuscript is lengthy and occasionally overloaded with notation.  Figures are informative but dense; captions could be more self‑explanatory.  Minor grammatical polishing and consistent notation would improve readability.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nDatasets are all public; human/animal subject issues are minimal.  The authors state that code will be released, but this should be verified before publication.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe paper introduces **StructuralGLIP**, a dual‑branch vision–language model for zero‑shot medical object detection.  A main branch processes image and target names, while an auxiliary branch encodes textual prompts into a *latent knowledge bank*.  A mutual‑selection mechanism retrieves the most relevant prompt and image tokens at each layer to form structural representations that enhance cross‑modal alignment.  The method supports both instance‑ and category‑level prompts and extends to a “zero‑shot enhancement” mode that boosts performance of fine‑tuned detectors without extra labels.  Experiments on endoscopic, microscopic, photographic, and radiologic datasets show consistent improvements over GLIP, MIU‑VL, AutoPrompter, and MPT baselines.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological innovation in structural prompt encoding and layer‑wise mutual selection.  \n- Comprehensive evaluation across multiple imaging modalities.  \n- Demonstrated ability to exploit category‑level prompts efficiently—reducing reliance on image‑specific prompt generation.  \n- Zero‑shot‑enhancement scenario is practically relevant for continuous model improvement in clinical settings.  \n- Solid ablation and analysis sections demonstrating mechanism behavior.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Limited theoretical justification of why mutual selection converges or how Top‑P/Q are chosen; lacks complexity and timing analysis.  \n- Statistical significance or confidence intervals of the reported AP gains are not provided.  \n- Section organization is somewhat verbose; methodology and experiments could be condensed.  \n- No external clinical validation or reader study to demonstrate impact on real clinical workflows.  \n- Reproducibility statement should include dataset licensing confirm‑ pliance and actual code availability date.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Quantitative significance** – add statistical analysis (e.g., paired t‑test or bootstrap CIs) of AP improvements to substantiate claimed gains.  \n2. **Computational cost** – report model parameters, GPU hours, and inference latency compared to GLIP; discuss scalability for clinical use.  \n3. **Clarify mutual‑selection implementation** – specify how Top‑P/Q are determined and whether gradients flow through selection.  \n4. **Reproducibility** – include hyperparameter tables, seeds, and ensure public release of prompt lists and code upon acceptance.  \n5. **Generalizability/clinical translation** – discuss how category‑level prompts could be standardized or curated in clinical vocabularies (e.g., SNOMED concepts) to facilitate deployment.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Streamline mathematical notation; unify subscript conventions \\(i\\), \\(l\\), \\(v\\).  \n- Improve Figure 1 and 3 captions; label components clearly.  \n- Minor grammar issues (“fine‑grained a lignment” → “alignment”, “Finetuned” → “Fine‑tuned”).  \n- Verify reference duplication (Li et al., 2022 b/c appear identical).  \n- Provide units or resolution info for datasets in Appendix C.  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.**  \nThe manuscript offers strong methodological novelty and promising results but needs additional quantitative analysis, presentation tightening, and reproducibility assurances to meet TMI publication standards.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n(High confidence in evaluation of novelty and technical quality; moderate confidence regarding implementation‑level details due to limited reproducibility information.)\n\n---\n\n**Summary Note to Editors:**  \nStructuralGLIP is scientifically interesting and aligns with the journal’s emphasis on fundamental methodological advances in imaging AI.  With more rigorous quantitative validation and improved clarity, the paper could become a solid contribution to zero‑shot and prompt‑driven medical image detection research.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThe paper proposes StructuralGLIP, a zero-shot medical detection framework that addresses coarse image-description alignment in existing grounded vision-language models. The method introduces a dual-branch architecture where prompts are encoded into a latent knowledge bank via an auxiliary branch, while the main branch processes target names and images. A mutual selection mechanism dynamically retrieves relevant visual and linguistic tokens at each layer to form structural representations. The approach supports both instance-level and category-level prompts, with category-level prompts remaining fixed across instances of the same class. Experiments across eight medical datasets (endoscopy, microscopy, photography, radiology) demonstrate superior performance in both zero-shot detection and zero-shot enhancement settings, achieving average improvements of +4.2% AP in zero-shot detection and enabling fine-tuned models to surpass fully supervised baselines.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n**• Mathematical Formulation Clarity and Consistency Issues**\n  - The mutual selection mechanism equations (6-7) use unclear notation where similarity calculations are embedded within Top-P/Top-Q operations without explicit definition of the similarity function (Section 3.2, Page 5). This obscures the computational process and reproducibility.\n  - The residual connections in Equation (9) lack mathematical justification for why additive combination is optimal compared to other fusion strategies, affecting theoretical soundness.\n  - Inconsistent notation usage where Ki_v and Ki_l represent both selected tokens and their associated values throughout Section 3.2, creating potential confusion in understanding the selection process.\n\n**• Insufficient Experimental Validation and Baseline Comparisons**\n  - Limited comparison with recent vision-language medical detection methods beyond GLIP-based approaches, with no comparison to domain-specific medical detection frameworks (Tables 1, 4). This restricts assessment of the method's competitive positioning.\n  - Ablation studies focus primarily on hyperparameters P and Q (Table 5) but lack comprehensive analysis of architectural choices such as the dual-branch design versus alternative fusion strategies, limiting understanding of design necessity.\n  - The zero-shot enhancement setting evaluation lacks comparison with other prompt-based enhancement methods on fine-tuned models, making it difficult to assess the uniqueness of the approach (Section 4.3).\n\n**• Methodological Limitations and Technical Concerns**\n  - The category-level prompt generation relies heavily on GPT-4 quality without systematic evaluation of prompt robustness across different medical domains (Section 3.3, Figure 3b). This creates potential generalization concerns for rare diseases or specialized imaging modalities.\n  - The mutual selection mechanism's computational overhead during inference is not quantified, particularly concerning the Top-P and Top-Q operations across multiple layers (Equations 6-7), which could impact clinical deployment feasibility.\n  - Limited analysis of failure cases or method limitations, with most qualitative results showing successful detections (Figures A, B, E) rather than systematic error analysis, reducing understanding of method boundaries.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n**• Enhance Mathematical Rigor and Notation Consistency**\n  - Explicitly define the similarity function used in Equations (6-7) with mathematical formulation (e.g., cosine similarity, dot product) and provide theoretical justification for the choice. Include algorithmic pseudocode for the Top-P/Top-Q selection process to improve reproducibility.\n  - Provide theoretical analysis or empirical validation for the additive residual connection design in Equation (9), comparing against alternative fusion strategies (concatenation, learned weighting) to justify the architectural choice.\n  - Establish consistent notation throughout Section 3.2, clearly distinguishing between token indices, selected tokens, and their representations, potentially using subscripts or different symbols to avoid confusion.\n\n**• Expand Experimental Evaluation and Analysis**\n  - Include comparisons with recent domain-specific medical detection methods and non-GLIP-based vision-language approaches to establish comprehensive competitive analysis. Add comparison with other prompt-based enhancement methods on fine-tuned models.\n  - Conduct systematic ablation studies on architectural components including dual-branch versus single-branch designs, alternative fusion mechanisms, and different knowledge bank organizations to validate design necessity.\n  - Provide detailed failure case analysis, computational cost analysis including inference time and memory overhead, and systematic evaluation of prompt robustness across different medical imaging modalities and rare diseases.\n\n**• Address Methodological Limitations and Practical Concerns**\n  - Develop systematic evaluation framework for prompt quality across different medical domains, including analysis of GPT-4 limitations for rare diseases and alternative prompt generation strategies for specialized medical contexts.\n  - Quantify computational overhead of the mutual selection mechanism and provide efficiency analysis comparing inference costs with baseline methods, including optimization strategies for clinical deployment.\n  - Include comprehensive error analysis with failure case studies, method limitation discussion, and systematic evaluation of robustness to noisy or incomplete prompts, providing clearer understanding of method applicability boundaries.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces StructuralGLIP, a novel framework for zero-shot medical detection that leverages a dual-branch architecture with a latent knowledge bank to enhance the alignment between target descriptions and medical images. The proposed method encodes prompts into a hierarchical knowledge bank and introduces a mutual selection mechanism to dynamically select the most relevant prompt features for each input image. The authors demonstrate that StructuralGLIP outperforms existing methods across various medical imaging datasets, including endoscopy, microscopy, photography, and radiology. The manuscript is well-written and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed method's performance and robustness.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The novelty of StructuralGLIP lies in its dual-branch architecture and the mutual selection mechanism for dynamic prompt selection. However, the manuscript should more explicitly differentiate StructuralGLIP from related works that also integrate category-level prompts and vision-language models. A clearer discussion on how StructuralGLIP's approach to prompt selection and alignment stands out from previous methods would strengthen the novelty argument.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experiments are conducted across multiple medical imaging datasets, which is commendable. However, the evaluation could benefit from a broader range of clinical scenarios and imaging conditions. Including prospective studies or real-world clinical data would provide a more comprehensive assessment of StructuralGLIP's practical utility. Additionally, the authors should consider conducting an ablation study to isolate the contributions of each component of the dual-branch architecture.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares StructuralGLIP with several state-of-the-art methods, but the inclusion of more recent and competitive baselines would be beneficial. Specifically, including methods that employ advanced prompt engineering techniques or those that have been shown to perform well on similar tasks would provide a more rigorous benchmark. This would help establish the relative improvement brought by StructuralGLIP.\n\n4. Reproducibility: While the authors state that the code will be made available, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameter settings. Providing a clear and complete description of these aspects is essential for reproducibility. Additionally, the authors should ensure that the code release includes all necessary components for others to reproduce the reported results.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Some figures (e.g., Figure 3) are cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative examples with zoomed-in regions to enhance readability.\n   \n2. Notation and Terminology: The notation and terminology used in Section 2.1 should be explained more thoroughly, especially regarding the forward operator and other symbols. Consistent notation throughout the manuscript is also recommended.\n   \n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the domain.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors, such as \"k-spacce\" and \"undersampling maskes,\" should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: improving medical detection without requiring extensive annotated data. The proposed StructuralGLIP framework introduces innovative techniques for fine-grained alignment between image features and target descriptions, particularly through its dual-branch architecture and mutual selection mechanism. The work demonstrates strong empirical results across various medical imaging datasets, indicating its potential clinical value. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by incorporating a wider range of clinical scenarios and more competitive baselines. The reproducibility of the approach is somewhat compromised by the lack of detailed methodological descriptions. Overall, the manuscript offers promising contributions to the field of zero-shot medical detection, but it requires some additional work to fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand their comparative analysis, strengthen validation across a broader range of clinical scenarios, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "## PROMPT AS KNOWLEDGE BANK: BOOST VISION-LANGUAGE MODEL VIA STRUCTURAL REPRESENTATION FOR ZERO-SHOT MEDICAL DETECTION\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes StructuralGLIP, a zero-shot medical detection framework that augments GLIP with a dual-branch architecture: a main branch for target names and images, and an auxiliary branch that encodes prompts into a latent “knowledge bank.” A mutual selection mechanism retrieves Top-P visual tokens and Top-Q linguistic tokens per layer to build structural representations, which are fused into the main branch via cross-modal attention. The method aims to address coarse image–text alignment and distribution shift from naïvely concatenated contextual prompts, and shows improvements across zero-shot detection and “zero-shot enhancement” (post-finetuning) settings using both instance- and category-level prompts.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe dual-branch design that separates target-name encoding from prompt encoding and fuses via layer-wise mutual selection is a thoughtful architectural modification to GLIP for mitigating distribution shift.The per-layer Top-P/Top-Q selection to form structural representations is a principled way to retrieve relevant prompt knowledge, aligning with retrieval-augmented paradigms but tailored to detection.Supports category-level prompts effectively, addressing a meaningful practical need (fixed, reusable prompts per disease category).\n- Experimental rigor and validationBroad evaluation across eight datasets spanning four imaging conditions (endoscopy, microscopy, photography, radiology), including ablations on selection hyperparameters (P, Q), fusion layer choices, and prompt source (VQA vs. VQA+LLM).Baseline comparisons include GLIP, MIU-VL, AutoPrompter, and MPT variants; analyses demonstrate favorable performance and highlight the distribution shift issue in zero-shot enhancement where other methods degrade.Robustness analysis with noisy prompts (BCCD) is a useful stress test indicating the selection mechanism’s filtering behavior.\n- Clarity of presentationThe high-level motivation is clearly stated: contextual prompts can misalign and induce distribution shift; decoupling prompts into a knowledge bank with instance-wise selection can help.Figures effectively contrast contextual vs. structural prompting and illustrate the dual-branch pipeline and prompt generation.\n- Significance of contributionsZero-shot enhancement is a realistic, clinically aligned evaluation setting that is often overlooked; demonstrating gains over fine-tuned GLIP and parity/advantage vs. fully supervised detectors underscores practical value.Showing that category-level prompts can rival or surpass instance-level prompts—in a method designed to leverage them—could materially improve deployment efficiency in clinical workflows.\n\n- The dual-branch design that separates target-name encoding from prompt encoding and fuses via layer-wise mutual selection is a thoughtful architectural modification to GLIP for mitigating distribution shift.\n- The per-layer Top-P/Top-Q selection to form structural representations is a principled way to retrieve relevant prompt knowledge, aligning with retrieval-augmented paradigms but tailored to detection.\n- Supports category-level prompts effectively, addressing a meaningful practical need (fixed, reusable prompts per disease category).\n\n- Broad evaluation across eight datasets spanning four imaging conditions (endoscopy, microscopy, photography, radiology), including ablations on selection hyperparameters (P, Q), fusion layer choices, and prompt source (VQA vs. VQA+LLM).\n- Baseline comparisons include GLIP, MIU-VL, AutoPrompter, and MPT variants;

selection over sets (K_v^i) vs. single tokens needs formalization.Computational and memory costs of layer-wise Top-P/Top-Q retrieval with long category prompts are not analyzed; per-layer retrieval may be expensive, and scalability is not quantified.It is not entirely clear how much the main-branch target representation is perturbed post-fusion in the fine-tuned setting, given residual connections still inject prompt-derived signals; a more rigorous argument or measurement of distribution shift mitigation is desirable.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesSome tables contain formatting artifacts and missing/misaligned numbers, impeding precise verification; radiology results are partially omitted due to low baselines, which weakens generality claims across modalities.Limited comparisons to broader OVD literature beyond GLIP-based variants (e.g., retrieval-augmented OVD like RALF; caption/prompt-enrichment like PCL) reduce external validity.No statistical significance analysis, seed variance, or confidence intervals; robustness beyond single runs is unclear.The “fairness” of prompt generation: for category-level prompts, the use of GPT-4 augmentation is strong but baselines may not equally exploit LLM-augmented prompt banks; this could inflate gains unless standardized.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesNotation and equations need tightening; some symbol reuse and subscript conventions are confusing (L1 vs L2 encoders “with shared parameters,” K_v^i vs 𝒦_v^i also appears).Important training details are deferred to appendices; the main text would benefit from a concise but explicit description of backbones, number of layers N, and the exact integration points in the GLIP stack.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsRelated retrieval-augmented or prompt-pool methods in continual learning are cited, but the contrast to instance‑wise soft synthesis/modulation (e.g., Prompt Customization), retrieval-augmented detection (e.g., RALF), and caption-enriched OVD (e.g., PCL) could be sharpened to better isolate novelty.Surveys on medical CLIP/VLP are relevant; deeper discussion could elucidate how StructuralGLIP complements domain-adapted VLPs vs. plug-in enhancements.\n\n- The mathematical formulation of the mutual selection is underspecified and occasionally inconsistent (e.g., o_j^i B_{q_j}^i, b_j^i K_v^i): shapes, normalization, and the exact similarity operators are unclear;

Please provide explicit equations for the similarity matrices, normalization, and how set–vector similarities (e.g., b_j^i with K_v^i) are reduced to scalar scores for Top-P/Top-Q.\n- What are the computational and memory overheads of layer-wise selection and fusion with long category prompts? Please report per-image latency and peak memory vs. GLIP, and how they scale with P, Q, N_l, and the number of fused layers.\n- In the zero-shot enhancement setting, how do you quantify distribution shift mitigation? Can you report cosine similarity (or KL divergence) of target representations T^N with/without prompts and relate that to performance changes vs. baselines that degrade?\n- How are prompts standardized across baselines for fair comparison, especially for category-level prompts enhanced by GPT-4? Did MIU-VL/AutoPrompter/MPT use exactly the same prompt strings and lengths?\n- Do you pre-encode category-level prompts once per dataset/class and reuse them across images? If so, how are they aligned to layer-wise retrieval (e.g., cached B^i per layer), and what is the practical speedup vs. instance-level prompts?\n- Could a soft, learned weighting over prompt tokens (akin to Prompt Customization) further improve over hard Top-P/Top-Q selection? Have you tried continuous selection/fusion as an ablation?\n- For TBX-11k zero-shot detection (non-enhancement), can you include results and qualitative analysis even if absolute performance is low? It would help understand modality-specific limitations.\n- What backbone and N (number of fusion layers) are used? Are encoders fully frozen in zero-shot detection, and which modules are trained (if any)? Please summarize core hyperparameters in the main text.\n- Have you conducted clinician validation of category-level prompts generated by GPT-4? If not, could you integrate automated filtering (e.g., CLIP-Score thresholds or ontology constraints) to reduce hallucinations?\n- How sensitive is performance to the VQA/LLM choices beyond the reported CLIP-Score correlations? Can you release the exact prompt templates and attribute vocabularies to ensure reproducibility?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper addresses an important and practical problem—improving zero-shot medical detection, including post-finetuning “zero-shot enhancement,” without additional labeled images. The proposed StructuralGLIP is a well-motivated extension of GLIP that decouples prompts into a knowledge bank and uses layer-wise mutual selection to retrieve and fuse relevant prompt tokens. Empirically, the method demonstrates consistent gains over strong GLIP-based baselines and, notably, makes effective use of category-level prompts—an operationally appealing setting. The work is technically sound at a high level and the evaluations are broad, with useful ablations and robustness checks. However, the current presentation has several gaps that limit verifiability and reproducibility: the mutual selection math is under-specified, computational overhead is not quantified, some tables are difficult to parse, and comparisons to broader OVD retrieval/caption-based methods could be strengthened. With clearer formalization, stronger methodological transparency, and a tighter placement among retrieval-augmented OVD and prompt-pool literature, this work has solid potential for a top-tier venue. I recommend acceptance after addressing the outlined technical clarifications, fairness controls, and reporting improvements.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces *StructuralGLIP*, a framework for zero-shot medical object detection that augments GLIP through a dual-branch architecture—one for target-name and image encoding, and another that encodes prompts into a latent “knowledge bank.” A mutual selection mechanism retrieves the most relevant visual and textual tokens per layer to construct structural representations, which are fused back into the main branch via cross-modal attention. This design aims to mitigate coarse image–text alignment and distribution shift caused by contextual prompt concatenation. The paper reports improvements in both zero-shot detection and “zero-shot enhancement” (fine-tuned) settings across multiple medical imaging modalities.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Technical specification:** The mathematical formulation of the mutual selection mechanism is underspecified. Equation notation, dimensional consistency (e.g., \\(o_j^i B_{q_j}^i\\), \\(b_j^i K_v^i\\)), normalization, and the definition of similarity functions (cosine vs. dot product, temperature scaling) should be clarified. The distinction between selection over token sets versus individual tokens requires formal definition.  \n2. **Efficiency and scalability:** Computational and memory costs of per-layer Top‑P/Top‑Q retrieval with long category prompts are unreported. A quantitative analysis of latency, memory overhead, and scaling with respect to P, Q, and model depth is necessary.  \n3. **Distribution shift mitigation:** It remains uncertain how much the fused branch alters target representations during fine-tuning. Empirical measurement of representation drift (e.g., cosine distance) would substantiate claims of reduced shift.  \n4. **Experimental completeness:** Several tables contain formatting issues or missing data, limiting verification. Radiology results are partly omitted, and comparison breadth is confined mainly to GLIP-derived baselines. Inclusion of retrieval-based and caption-enriched OVD methods (e.g., RALF, PCL) would strengthen evidence.  \n5. **Reproducibility and fairness:** Statistical significance, seed variance, and consistent prompt generation across baselines are missing. The use of GPT‑4 for category-level prompts is advantageous but could produce unfair comparisons if baselines do not use similar augmentation.  \n6. **Presentation and related work:** Some notations are confusing and key training details (backbones, number of fusion layers) are deferred to appendices. Related work discussion could better distinguish StructuralGLIP from retrieval-augmented and continual learning prompt‑pool methods.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Improve consistency of symbols (e.g., \\(K_v^i\\) vs. \\(𝒦_v^i\\), L1/L2 encoders).  \n- Clarify whether category-level prompts are pre-encoded and reused across images to improve inference speed.  \n- Add missing results (e.g., TBX‑11k) even if absolute numbers are low.  \n- Provide variation metrics over multiple runs.  \n- Discuss clinician validation or automatic filtering of GPT‑4–generated prompts to ensure reliability.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, this work presents a technically interesting and well-motivated extension of GLIP addressing zero-shot medical detection. It achieves notable gains, particularly in category-level prompting, and demonstrates broad empirical coverage. The main limitations lie in incomplete mathematical formalization, lack of explicit efficiency evaluation, partial reporting, and limited external comparison. With clearer exposition, consistent experimental reporting, and stronger situating among related retrieval and prompt-based methods, the paper could make a substantial contribution to zero-shot detection in medical imaging.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation:** *Accept after minor revision.*",

        "text": "# Review Report for \"PROMPT AS KNOWLEDGE BANK: BOOST VISION-LANGUAGE MODEL VIA STRUCTURAL REPRESENTATION FOR ZERO-SHOT MEDICAL DETECTION\"\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis manuscript addresses the critical challenge of zero-shot medical detection, which enables clinical models to detect new pathologies without requiring additional annotated medical images. The authors identify a key limitation in current approaches: contextual prompt methods that treat prompts as simple equivalents to disease names, resulting in coarse image-description alignment and distribution shift problems. To overcome this, they propose StructuralGLIP, a novel framework that encodes prompts into a latent knowledge bank using a dual-branch architecture with mutual selection mechanism. This approach dynamically matches vision features with relevant prompt features at each layer, enabling fine-grained structural representations that capture nuanced relationships between medical images and target descriptions. The authors demonstrate that StructuralGLIP significantly outperforms existing methods across eight diverse medical datasets spanning endoscopy, microscopy, photography, and radiology imaging modalities. Crucially, their method effectively leverages category-level prompts (which remain fixed across all instances of the same category) to achieve an average 30.4 AP across datasets, substantially outperforming both traditional zero-shot methods and even surpassing supervised models like RetinaNet in the zero-shot enhancement setting.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper presents a well-motivated and significant contribution to zero-shot medical detection by addressing a clear limitation in current contextual prompt methods.\n- The dual-branch architecture with mutual selection mechanism is a novel and conceptually sound approach that effectively resolves the distribution shift problem when incorporating prompts.\n- The demonstration that category-level prompts (which require no per-image generation) can outperform instance-specific prompts is particularly valuable for clinical deployment.\n- The comprehensive evaluation across eight diverse medical datasets with different imaging modalities provides strong evidence of the method's robustness and generalizability.\n- The zero-shot enhancement experiments are clinically relevant, showing how the approach can improve already fine-tuned models without requiring additional annotations.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper lacks sufficient detail about the computational overhead of the dual-branch architecture compared to single-branch methods. While the authors mention efficiency benefits of category-level prompts, they don't quantify the actual inference time or resource requirements.\n- The analysis of failure cases is limited; understanding when and why the method underperforms would strengthen clinical applicability claims.\n- The paper doesn't sufficiently address potential clinical risks of deploying zero-shot detection systems, particularly regarding false positives/negatives for rare conditions that might not be well-represented in the prompt knowledge bank.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The visualizations (Figures 1-10) are well-designed and effectively illustrate the proposed method and its advantages.\n- The ablation studies on layer fusion and prompt selection parameters provide valuable insights for potential adopters.\n- The detailed prompt banks in Appendix G offer transparency and reproducibility.\n- The inclusion of natural image experiments (Figure F) helps validate the generalizability of the approach beyond medical imaging.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The description of the mutual selection mechanism (Section 3.2) could be clarified with more concrete mathematical notation.\n- Some figures (e.g., Figure 9) would benefit from more detailed captions explaining the visualization elements.\n- The paper would benefit from a brief discussion of how to handle extremely rare conditions where LLM-generated prompts might be inaccurate due to limited training data.\n- The CLIP-Score analysis could be expanded to include more diverse medical scenarios beyond the two datasets shown.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance (High):** The paper addresses a clinically important problem: enabling medical detection systems to incorporate new pathology knowledge without requiring additional annotated data. This has direct relevance to real-world clinical settings where new disease variants emerge and annotated data is scarce. The demonstrated performance (outperforming supervised methods in some cases) represents a meaningful advance for medical AI.\n\n**Innovation (High):** The dual-branch architecture with mutual selection mechanism represents a genuine conceptual advance over existing contextual prompt methods. The key innovation—treating prompts as a knowledge bank rather than simple context—provides a new paradigm for vision-language alignment in medical imaging. The effective use of category-level prompts is particularly innovative, as previous methods struggled with this approach.\n\n**Evaluation (High):** The evaluation is comprehensive and rigorous, covering eight diverse medical datasets across four imaging modalities. The inclusion of both zero-shot detection and zero-shot enhancement settings provides a realistic assessment of clinical applicability. The ablation studies and analysis of prompt selection mechanisms add depth to the evaluation. However, the paper could strengthen its evaluation with more failure case analysis.\n\n**Reproducibility (High):** The method is described with sufficient detail for replication, including architecture specifications, hyperparameters, and training procedures. The authors promise to release code, which is crucial for reproducibility. The detailed prompt banks in Appendix G further enhance reproducibility. The only limitation is the lack of computational resource specifications.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThis is a strong paper that makes a significant contribution to zero-shot medical detection with a well-motivated, innovative approach and comprehensive evaluation. The results are compelling and demonstrate clear advantages over existing methods. However, before acceptance, I recommend addressing the following:\n\n1. Provide quantitative analysis of computational overhead (inference time, memory requirements) compared to baseline methods\n2. Expand the discussion of failure cases and clinical risks, particularly for rare conditions\n3. Clarify the mutual selection mechanism with additional mathematical notation where appropriate\n4. Include a brief discussion of how the approach might handle extremely rare conditions with limited LLM knowledge\n\nThese revisions would strengthen an already high-quality paper and ensure its clinical relevance is fully articulated. The authors have demonstrated strong technical work that aligns well with TMI's focus on impactful medical imaging research.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles zero‑shot medical object detection, aiming to boost detection performance without the need for additional annotated medical images. Existing zero‑shot methods typically rely on simple prompts that consist solely of disease names, which limits the granularity of alignment between visual cues and textual descriptions. To address this limitation, the authors propose **StructuralGLIP**, a dual‑branch architecture in which an auxiliary branch encodes detailed prompts into a hierarchical knowledge bank, while the primary branch processes the target name together with the image. At every encoder layer a mutual‑selection mechanism extracts the most relevant visual tokens and prompt tokens, producing structural representations that are subsequently fused via cross‑modal attention. Experiments are reported on eight benchmarks covering endoscopy, microscopy, photography, and radiology, evaluating both pure zero‑shot scenarios and zero‑shot enhancement after fine‑tuning. The results show consistent improvements over previously reported methods across these datasets. The central contribution is presented as a framework that treats prompts as a latent knowledge bank, enabling layer‑wise, instance‑specific selection and finer vision‑language alignment for medical detection.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:** While reducing annotation effort for rare diseases is an attractive goal, the reported performance gains (approximately +4 % AP) are modest and the manuscript does not demonstrate any downstream clinical relevance.  \n- **Innovation:** The hierarchical knowledge bank and per‑layer mutual‑selection are described as novel compared with prior prompt‑concatenation approaches (see Fig. 1). However, the top‑k similarity selection at the heart of the method resembles established retrieval‑based techniques, and the paper offers no theoretical justification for its design.  \n- **Evaluation:**  \n  1. The absence of confidence intervals or standard deviations makes it impossible to gauge whether the observed improvements are statistically significant.  \n  2. Baseline comparisons are restricted to GLIP‑derived methods (MIU‑VL, AutoPrompter, MPT); recent open‑vocabulary detectors such as DetCLIP, OWL‑DET, and PromptDet are not included, limiting the scope of the assessment.  \n  3. The radiology dataset TBX‑11k is omitted from key tables because the GLIP baseline performs poorly, raising doubts about the method’s generality.  \n  4. In the “zero‑shot enhancement” experiments (Table 4) the authors compare only against RetinaNet and Faster RCNN, neglecting more recent fully‑supervised detectors (e.g., DyHead, Swin‑Transformer‑based models).  \n- **Reproducibility:**  \n  * The provided code link is a placeholder (“XXX”) and the repository is unavailable.  \n  * Critical implementation details—including learning rates, optimizer settings for the auxiliary branch, values of the hyper‑parameters P and Q, token dimension D, number of layers N, and GPU memory consumption—are relegated to an unavailable appendix.  \n  * Only a single hyper‑parameter setting (P = 10, Q = 10) is reported (Table 4.4); systematic sweeps over these parameters are missing.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n- The mutual‑selection mechanism (Equations 6‑7) is presented without an intuitive explanation, pseudo‑code, or clarification of the similarity metric (cosine versus L2). It is also unclear whether the top‑k selection is performed per image or globally. *(Section 3.2, Fig. 1)*  \n- No analysis of the runtime or memory overhead introduced by maintaining a knowledge bank across all transformer layers is provided; a computational‑complexity discussion is absent.  \n- The omission of recent open‑vocabulary detection baselines (DetCLIP, OWL‑DET, PromptDet) makes it difficult to discern whether the reported gains arise from the architectural changes or simply from richer textual inputs. *(Tables 1‑4)*  \n- Performance tables list single AP values without error bars or statistical testing; the claimed +4.2 % AP improvement may be within experimental variance.  \n- Descriptions of the training/validation/test splits for the eight benchmarks are terse; it is not evident whether cross‑validation or a single split was employed, which hampers reproducibility. *(Section 4.1)*  \n- Prompt generation details are insufficient: category‑level prompts are said to be generated with GPT‑4 and instance‑level prompts with BLIP, yet the actual templates, token counts, and any verification of medical correctness are not disclosed.  \n- The ablation study is limited: Figure 4 investigates fusion at different layers, and Table 4.4 varies P/Q only on the CVC‑300 dataset. Broader ablations across all datasets are needed to confirm the robustness of the design choices.  \n- No user study, radiologist evaluation, or analysis of diagnostic impact is presented, especially for the challenging TBX‑11k radiology dataset.  \n- The manuscript contains numerous typographical and formatting errors (e.g., “BOOST VISION## LANGUAGE MODEL”, broken symbols) and an incomplete caption for Figure 1, which detracts from readability.  \n- The promised GitHub repository remains a placeholder and is currently inaccessible, precluding verification of the implementation.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\nThe manuscript falls short of the novelty and methodological rigor required for publication. The incremental performance gains are not substantiated with statistical evidence, the evaluation lacks comprehensive baselines, and critical reproducibility details are missing. Consequently, the work does not meet the standards for acceptance in its current form.",

It fulfills the needs in real-world diagnosis protocol to leverage information from different data sources and simultaneously perform mutually informative tasks. However, medical imaging domains introduce two key challenges: dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence. The quality and amount of task-related information from different modalities could vary significantly across patient samples, due to biological and demographic factors. Traditional fusion methods apply fixed combination strategies that fail to capture this dynamic relationship, potentially underutilizing modalities that carry stronger diagnostic signals for specific patients. Additionally, different clinical tasks may require dynamic feature selection and combination from various modalities, a phenomenon we term “modality-task dependence.” To address these issues, we propose M4oE, a novel Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts framework for precise Medical diagnosis. M4oE comprises Modality-Specific (MSoE) modules and a Modality-shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module. With collaboration from both modules, our model dynamically decomposes and learns distinct and shared information from different modalities and achieves dynamic fusion. MToE provides a joint probability model of modalities and tasks by using experts as a link and encourages experts to learn modality-task dependence via conditional mutual information loss. By doing so, M4oE offers sample and population-level interpretability of modality contributions. We evaluate M4oE on four public multi-modal medical benchmark datasets for solving two important medical diagnostic problems including breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis. Results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art methods under different metrics of classification and segmentation tasks like Accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC, and DICE.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a multi-modal, multi-task, mixture of experts for various medical diagnoses to address the challenges of sample-dynamic modality fusion (and modality-task dependence (selecting the right modalities for a task). Concretely, this is done by using a combination of modality-specific experts and experts shared between modalities and tasks. M4OE shows promising initial results in terms of both absolute performance and enforcing modality utilization.\n\nBased on the weaknesses and questions outlined my score indicates a rejection for now, but I generally like the motivation of the paper, especially the aspect on modality utilization. I am willing to increase my score if my concerns are addressed and questions clarified.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The M4OE is highly effective at enforcing modality utilization - this is a meaningful contribution that many multimodal models suffer from, although I do have some questions about this.\n- The overall performance of the model is outperforming the baseline, even if the results are missing crucial information to validate the statistical significance of the results.\n- Strong visuals that are additive to the understanding of the paper.\n- Good conceptual motivation of the paper, although I believe that the motivation would further benefit from some concrete examples of sample dynamism and clinical examples of tasks that are modality-dependent.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Abstract: the one-liner for sample-dynamic modality fusion is unclear as the specific and shared information always varies per sample unless they are identical. To my knowledge, sample-dynamic spans a much wider field of problems like missingness, robustness to noise, which the manuscript does not consider.\n- Abstract: “Results demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods” is extremely vague. Along which metric?\n- You claim an expansive space by saying that the method is “multi-modal multi-task”, but your experiments only look at multi-view settings of a single modality (images). I would encourage you to narrow the scope/claim of the paper as the paper does not consider heterogeneous modalities (images, text, tabular, etc.).\n- Experimental setup: I would encourage you to provide more detail in this section to aid reproducibility. For example, it is unclear whether cross-validation is used. No confidence intervals or standard deviation of results are reported to judge the statistical significance of the results. Additionally, no code was provided in the supplementary materials that would help with the clarification of the experimental setup.\n- Literature: missing out on the largest corpus of literature (intermediate fusion), which many latent variable models for multimodal fusion fall under, many of which are using a mix of modality-specific and shared spaces.\n\n### Questions\n\n- How do you determine which expert sees which task? The connection between Figure 1 and the method section is not very clear.\n- The manuscript talks a lot about sample adaptivity, but how does your experimental setup show that the model handles sample adaptivity effectively? Which aspects of sample adaptivity?\n- Figure 3c suggests that the modality utilization is forced towards the same mean in your method. What about cases where modality dominance/competition is good? For example, if I have one very noisy modality, wouldn’t it be desirable to have the modality that contains all the signal to get all the model’s attention? Isn’t this graph showing that we enforce equal utilisation of all modalities regardless of the signal? Additionally, does this finding not contradict your claim in Figure 1, which is that only some experts are used (as opposed to all experts with a more balanced contribution).\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 3",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces **M4OE**, a multi-modal, multi-task mixture-of-experts model designed for medical diagnosis. Its stated aim is to address challenges in **sample-dynamic modality fusion** and **modality-task dependence**, ensuring appropriate modality selection per task. The approach combines modality-specific and shared experts across tasks, reporting improved overall performance and enhanced modality utilization. The manuscript is generally clear and visually well presented, though several conceptual and methodological details need clarification before the contribution can be fully assessed.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Scope and Claims**: The paper claims broad generality as a “multi-modal, multi-task” framework, yet experiments focus on multi-view settings within a single modality (images). This discrepancy suggests the scope should be narrowed or claims revised.  \n2. **Definition of Sample-Dynamic Fusion**: The abstract’s description of “sample-dynamic modality fusion” is unclear. The concept as stated does not adequately account for the full range of issues—such as missingness or robustness to noise—typically associated with sample-dynamic problems.  \n3. **Evaluation and Statistical Reporting**: Experimental details are insufficient for reproducibility. It is unclear whether cross-validation was used, and no confidence intervals or standard deviations are reported, hindering any assessment of statistical significance. The supplementary materials lack code or documentation that might clarify the setup.  \n4. **Literature Context**: The manuscript omits important related work on intermediate fusion models, particularly those using mixtures of modality-specific and shared latent spaces.  \n5. **Empirical Support for Sample Adaptivity**: While sample adaptivity is emphasized conceptually, the experiments do not clearly demonstrate how the model achieves or tests this property.  \n6. **Interpretation of Modality Utilization (Figure 3c)**: The results appear to enforce uniform utilization across modalities, raising concerns about scenarios where uneven weighting is beneficial (e.g., noisy modalities). This could contradict the earlier claim that only a subset of experts is selectively used.  \n7. **Methodological Clarity**: The process for assigning experts to tasks is not well explained, particularly the linkage between Figure 1 and the method description.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The abstract overstates results with vague claims such as “superiority over state-of-the-art methods” without defining specific metrics.  \n- The terminology and notation around modality-task dependence could benefit from additional clarification.  \n- The paper’s motivation is strong, but inclusion of concrete examples—e.g., particular diagnostic tasks or modalities—would improve accessibility.  \n- Figures are overall clear and helpful.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis manuscript presents a promising idea for enforcing modality utilization in multimodal learning. Strengths include solid motivation, appealing visualizations, and indications of performance gains. However, claims of generality, lack of methodological detail, missing statistical analysis, and incomplete engagement with relevant literature limit the manuscript’s current soundness and reproducibility. These aspects need significant clarification and revision for the work to reach its potential contribution level.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**: **Major Revision / Reject (resubmit after substantial revision)**",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses multi-modal multi-task learning in medical imaging by proposing M4oE (Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts). The authors identify two key challenges: dynamic modality fusion where the quality and relevance of different imaging modalities varies across patients, and modality-task dependence where different clinical tasks require dynamic feature selection from various modalities. M4oE consists of Modality-Specific MoE (MSoE) modules and a Modality-shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module that dynamically decomposes modality-specific and shared information. The framework uses conditional mutual information loss to encourage experts to learn modality-task dependencies. Experiments on four public datasets (EMBED, RSNA, VinDr-Mammo, GAMMA) for breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across classification and segmentation tasks, measured by Accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC, and DICE scores.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - The conditional probability definitions in Section 3.3 lack clear denominators and appear inconsistent (e.g., P(Ej|Tk) formula uses summation over modalities in numerator but tasks and experts in denominator)\n  - The conditional mutual information I(M; E|T) formulation in Section 3.3 is presented without sufficient mathematical rigor regarding how probabilities are estimated from the soft routing weights\n  - The relationship between the routing matrix XΦ and probability distributions needs clearer mathematical justification, particularly how soft weights translate to valid probability measures\n\n• **Limited experimental rigor and evaluation gaps**\n  - Table 1 shows results only for 3 out of 7 tasks on EMBED dataset, with complete results relegated to appendix, limiting assessment of multi-task performance claims\n  - The gradient conflict analysis in Figure 6 uses only a reduced experiment (16 experts, 7 tasks) rather than the full model configuration, weakening the validity of this key claim\n  - Cross-validation methodology is mentioned as 5-fold but detailed experimental setup, statistical significance testing, and error analysis are insufficient across all experiments\n\n• **Insufficient baseline comparisons and ablation studies**\n  - The paper lacks comparison with recent MoE-based medical imaging methods, with some comparisons mentioned as \"included in Appendix\" (Page 7) but not thoroughly analyzed\n  - Ablation studies in Table 2 are limited to only 3 tasks from EMBED dataset, insufficient to validate component effectiveness across diverse medical imaging scenarios\n  - The modality competition analysis in Figure 3(a) compares only against basic fusion methods rather than more sophisticated multi-modal approaches from recent literature\n\n• **Questionable interpretability claims and analysis depth**\n  - The sample-level interpretability claims in Figure 5 lack validation against ground truth or clinical expert assessment, making it unclear whether the interpretations are medically meaningful\n  - The synergy analysis using PID theory in Figure 4 requires external domain knowledge not sufficiently explained, and the clinical relevance of the synergy patterns is not validated\n  - Population-level modality contribution analysis lacks statistical validation and comparison with known clinical understanding of modality importance for different tasks\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Provide rigorous derivations for all conditional probability formulations in Section 3.3, clearly defining how soft routing weights are converted to valid probability distributions\n  - Add formal mathematical proofs or detailed explanations for the conditional mutual information objective, including convergence properties and theoretical justifications\n  - Standardize notation throughout the paper and ensure all probability expressions have consistent and correct mathematical forms with proper normalization\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation and statistical analysis**\n  - Report complete results for all 7 tasks on EMBED dataset in the main paper with proper statistical significance testing and confidence intervals\n  - Conduct gradient conflict analysis using the full model configuration (128 experts) rather than reduced settings to validate this key technical claim\n  - Provide detailed cross-validation procedures, statistical significance tests, and comprehensive error analysis for all experimental results across all datasets\n\n• **Expand baseline comparisons and comprehensive ablation studies**\n  - Include thorough comparison with recent MoE-based medical imaging methods in the main paper rather than relegating to appendix\n  - Conduct ablation studies across all four datasets and all tasks to demonstrate consistent component effectiveness across diverse medical imaging scenarios\n  - Compare against more sophisticated multi-modal fusion approaches from recent literature in the modality competition analysis\n\n• **Validate interpretability claims with clinical ground truth**\n  - Collaborate with clinical experts to validate whether sample-level and population-level interpretability outputs align with known medical understanding\n  - Provide statistical validation of modality contribution patterns against established clinical knowledge and compare with expert radiologist assessments\n  - Include more detailed explanation of PID theory and clinical validation of synergy patterns, demonstrating that the learned modality-task dependencies reflect genuine medical insights",

Novelty and Positioning: While the proposed M4oE framework introduces innovative elements such as dynamic modality fusion and task-specific feature selection, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing multi-modal multi-task learning methods. The authors should clarify how M4oE stands apart from recent advancements in the field, particularly those that also employ MoE architectures.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experimental setup is comprehensive, covering multiple datasets and tasks. However, the inclusion of additional real-world clinical scenarios and a wider variety of medical imaging modalities would further strengthen the validation of M4oE's generalizability. Additionally, the authors should consider providing more detailed insights into the robustness of M4oE under varying data quality and availability conditions.\n\n3. Comparisons: The comparison against state-of-the-art methods is thorough, but the manuscript should include a discussion on the limitations of the chosen baselines. For instance, the authors could elaborate on why certain methods were excluded and how the inclusion of these methods might impact the comparative analysis.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript mentions that the code will be made available, but it is essential to ensure that the methodology is sufficiently detailed to enable independent replication of the results. Providing explicit instructions on data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and training procedures would greatly enhance the reproducibility of M4oE.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity of Figures: Some figures (e.g., Figure 3) are cluttered and could be improved by focusing on fewer representative examples with zoomed-in regions.\n2. Notation Consistency: There are inconsistencies in the notation used for the forward operator and other mathematical symbols, which could be clarified.\n3.

The innovation lies in the dynamic fusion of modalities and the explicit modeling of modality-task dependence, which could lead to improved interpretability and performance in medical diagnosis. The evaluation demonstrates the method's superiority over existing approaches across various datasets and tasks, indicating its potential clinical impact. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including a broader range of clinical scenarios and modalities. The reproducibility of M4oE is promising, although additional methodological details are necessary to ensure complete replicability. Overall, M4oE shows promise but requires further refinement in terms of comparative analysis and generalizability to fully meet the standards of TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include a broader range of methods, strengthen the validation across different clinical scenarios, and provide more detailed methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "## DYNAMIC MODELING OF PATIENTS, MODALITIES AND TASKS VIA MULTI-MODAL MULTI-TASK MIXTURE OF EXPERTS\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes M⁴oE, a multi-modal multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework that learns both sample-dynamic modality-specific information and task-dependent modality-shared information. The architecture combines modality-specific Soft-MoE modules (MSoE) with a modality-shared modality–task MoE (MToE) guided by a conditional mutual information (CMI) regularizer, and introduces a joint probability view to interpret modality–expert–task dependencies. Experiments on four public datasets across mammography and ophthalmology show consistent gains over strong baselines for classification and segmentation, with analyses on modality competition, modality–task synergy, and gradient conflicts.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe decomposition into modality-specific and modality-shared MoE components is well-motivated and addresses the “modality competition” issue in a principled way.The MToE introduces task slots and task embeddings, providing a practical mechanism to model modality–task dependence and to specialize experts across tasks.The conditional mutual information regularizer to encourage task-conditional dependence between modalities and experts is an interesting design that aims to improve identifiability and interpretability.The joint probabilistic perspective over modalities, experts, and tasks offers a path toward sample-level and dataset-level interpretability.\n- Experimental rigor and validationExtensive evaluation across four public datasets (EMBED, RSNA, VinDr, GAMMA) with heterogeneous modalities and tasks (classification, segmentation) demonstrates generality.Ablation studies show the contribution of both MSoE and MToE and the effect of the CMI term and number of experts.Analyses include synergy (PID-based) to study modality–task dependence and gradient conflict evaluation, going beyond aggregate metrics.\n- Clarity of presentationThe high-level motivation and clinical relevance are clearly articulated, with concrete examples (e.g., FFDM vs 2DS, CFP vs OCT) and intuitive hypotheses.The architectural overview and the stepwise data flow (embedders → MToE → MSoE → fusion → task heads) are conceptually clear and supported by figure descriptions.\n- Significance of contributionsThe problem of dynamic, task-dependent multimodal fusion is important in medical imaging, where modality quality and utility vary across patients and tasks.Demonstrating performance gains and interpretability across multiple institutions and populations suggests meaningful potential impact for clinical AI systems.\n\n- The decomposition into modality-specific and modality-shared MoE components is well-motivated and addresses the “modality competition” issue in a principled way.\n- The MToE introduces task slots and task embeddings, providing a practical mechanism to model modality–task dependence and to specialize experts across tasks.\n- The conditional mutual information regularizer to encourage task-conditional dependence between modalities and experts is an interesting design that aims to improve identifiability and interpretability.\n- The joint probabilistic perspective over modalities, experts, and tasks offers a path toward sample-level and dataset-level interpretability.\n\n- Extensive evaluation across four public datasets (EMBED, RSNA, VinDr, GAMMA) with heterogeneous modalities and tasks (classification, segmentation) demonstrates generality.\n- Ablation studies show the contribution of both MSoE and MToE and the effect of the CMI term and number of experts.\n- Analyses include synergy (PID-based) to study modality–task dependence and gradient conflict evaluation, going beyond aggregate metrics.\n\n- The high-level motivation and clinical relevance are clearly articulated, with concrete examples (e.g., FFDM vs 2DS, CFP vs OCT) and intuitive hypotheses.\n- The architectural overview and the stepwise data flow (embedders → MToE → MSoE → fusion → task heads) are conceptually clear and supported by figure descriptions.\n\n- The problem of dynamic, task-dependent multimodal fusion is important in medical imaging, where modality quality and utility vary across patients and tasks.\n- Demonstrating performance gains and interpretability across multiple institutions and populations suggests meaningful potential impact for clinical AI systems.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsProbability modeling for interpretability appears to use unnormalized routing logits (XΦ) instead of normalized dispatch/combine probabilities, which is not a valid probabilistic measure and could bias the estimated P(E|T), P(M|T), and P(M,E|T).The CMI objective relies on the above probabilities; without proper normalization and calibration, its theoretical grounding and interpretability are weakened.The MoE training typically benefits from load-balance/importance regularizers to prevent expert collapse; these are not described, raising concerns about stability and expert utilization skew.Computational complexity may scale as O(l m n p) for routing across tokens, modalities, experts, and tasks; the paper does not quantify training/inference cost or memory versus baselines.Handling missing modalities and asynchrony—common in real clinical workflows—is not addressed.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesStatistical significance, confidence intervals, and calibration (e.g., AUROC/AUPRC with bootstrapped CIs, ECE) are missing; many gains are modest and would benefit from significance testing.Fairness of comparisons is unclear: expert counts and model capacities are larger than many baselines; hyperparameter tuning budgets for baselines are not reported; inference cost comparisons are absent.The segmentation pipeline details are thin (decoder architecture, loss, how tokens map to masks), limiting reproducibility and interpretability of segmentation results.No robustness studies (distribution shift, missing modalities, noise) or subgroup analyses (e.g., by breast density, age, scanner/vendor) are reported.Cross-dataset generalization (train on one site, test on another) is not evaluated; all results appear to be within-dataset cross-validation.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesNotation and shape definitions in the MToE and probability modeling sections are inconsistent (e.g., rows vs columns softmax; sums over indices; M2oE vs M⁴oE naming; occasional typos like “MSvE/MSoE”).The dispatch/combine matrices and their shapes and normalization axes are not consistently specified, hindering precise understanding.The probabilistic modeling section mixes token- and modality-level quantities without a clean marginalization derivation.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsTask-conditioned MoE for multi-task vision (e.g., M3ViT) directly tackles gradient conflicts and should be cited and compared or discussed.Recent MoE fusion works such as FuseMoE (Laplace gating, improved expert balance, missing-modality robustness), and differentiable routing alternatives like SMEAR should be discussed to better situate the approach.Multi-modal mammography transformers for risk and detection (e.g., large-scale temporal cross-modal models) are highly relevant for contextualizing the mammography results and clinical significance.Prompt-expert approaches (MoPE) and data-free MoE merging (WEMoE) illustrate other ways to achieve adaptive specialization; relating to them would enrich the framing.\n\n- Probability modeling for interpretability appears to use unnormalized routing logits (XΦ) instead of normalized dispatch/combine probabilities, which is not a valid probabilistic measure and could bias the estimated P(E|T), P(M|T), and P(M,E|T).\n- The CMI objective relies on the above probabilities;

relating to them would enrich the framing.\n\n### Detailed Comments\n\n- Technical soundness evaluationThe core MoE design is reasonable; however, the probability modeling of P(E|T), P(M|T), P(M,E|T) should use normalized routing probabilities (e.g., expected dispatch/combination weights D and C) aggregated over tokens and samples. Using raw logits (XΦ) breaks probabilistic interpretation. Recommend computing empirical conditional distributions from normalized D and C, with appropriate marginalization over tokens and samples, and possibly temperature scaling or calibration.The conditional mutual information objective I(M;E|T) is sound conceptually, but its estimation should be based on properly normalized empirical distributions with smoothing to avoid zero-probability issues. Clarify whether estimates are per-batch or running averages, and whether gradients are stopped through the probability estimates or not (to avoid degenerate feedback loops).Add a standard MoE load-balancing/importance loss to avoid expert collapse and improve specialization stability, or clarify if the CMI term implicitly achieves this. Report expert utilization entropy and coefficient of variation.Complexity: Give FLOPs/throughput and memory for representative settings (tokens l, modalities m, experts n, tasks p) and compare to late/early fusion and to MoE baselines (e.g., soft MoE without MToE). Consider top-k/sparse routing variants or per-modality routers to reduce O(n p) scaling.Segmentation head: Provide architectural details (decoder design, upsampling, loss functions), how token features are mapped to spatial masks, and how multi-scale information is handled.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentReport AUROC/AUPRC with bootstrapped 95% CIs for classification tasks (especially imbalanced risk), and DICE with CIs for segmentation. Add calibration metrics (ECE, Brier) and threshold selection protocol.Perform statistical tests for pairwise comparisons where absolute gains are small (e.g., +0.5–1.5%), and report effect sizes.Baseline fairness: Match model capacity where possible (parameter counts, depth/width) or include capacity-controlled ablations. Detail tuning budgets and early stopping criteria for all baselines.Robustness: Evaluate missing-modality robustness (e.g., modality dropout during training and test-time ablations), noise corruptions, and cross-site generalization (train on one dataset, test on another), especially given the clinical heterogeneity.Subgroup analyses: For mammography, stratify by BI-RADS density, age groups, and vendor; test whether modality contributions correlate with known clinical patterns and whether performance holds across subgroups.Ablations: Include ablation of task embeddings, number of task slots per expert, routing temperature, and effect of replacing soft routing with top-k routing. Quantify the impact of the CMI loss on synergy patterns and expert specialization.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)FuseMoE (2402.03226) shows Laplace distance-based gating improves expert balance and convergence; discussing or testing Laplace gating in MToE could further mitigate modality competition and improve routing stability.M3ViT (2210.14793) demonstrates that task-dependent sparse MoE reduces gradient conflicts; positioning your gradient conflict analysis against M3ViT would strengthen claims and suggest architectural synergies.SMEAR (2306.03745) provides fully differentiable expert merging; while different in goal, contrasting routing stability and compute trade-offs would contextualize your design choices.Large multimodal mammography transformers (e.g., MMT/NYU) demonstrate strong cross-modal fusion for detection and long-term risk; referencing them clarifies the clinical landscape and how your approach relates in scope (e.g., simultaneous multi-task learning versus longitudinal modeling).Prompt-expert fusion (MoPE, 2403.10568) and data-free merging (WEMoE, 2402.00433) highlight alternative specialization mechanisms; brief discussion can help frame your expert specialization and interpretability contributions.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe proposed interpretability (sample- and population-level modality contributions) is clinically valuable but should be presented cautiously: routing weights are a proxy for contribution, not causal evidence. Consider complementary attribution analyses (e.g., intervention by ablating modalities) to validate interpretability claims.Clinical deployment would require calibration, stability under acquisition differences, and bias assessment across demographics; the diverse datasets are a good starting point, but targeted fairness audits are recommended.Computational cost and energy footprint of large expert pools can be a concern in clinical settings; reporting throughput and memory will help practitioners assess deployability.\n\n- The core MoE design is reasonable; however, the probability modeling of P(E|T), P(M|T), P(M,E|T) should use normalized routing probabilities (e.g., expected dispatch/combination weights D and C) aggregated over tokens and samples. Using raw logits (XΦ) breaks probabilistic interpretation.

Detail tuning budgets and early stopping criteria for all baselines.\n- Robustness: Evaluate missing-modality robustness (e.g., modality dropout during training and test-time ablations), noise corruptions, and cross-site generalization (train on one dataset, test on another), especially given the clinical heterogeneity.\n- Subgroup analyses: For mammography, stratify by BI-RADS density, age groups, and vendor; test whether modality contributions correlate with known clinical patterns and whether performance holds across subgroups.\n- Ablations: Include ablation of task embeddings, number of task slots per expert, routing temperature, and effect of replacing soft routing with top-k routing. Quantify the impact of the CMI loss on synergy patterns and expert specialization.\n\n- FuseMoE (2402.03226) shows Laplace distance-based gating improves expert balance and convergence; discussing or testing Laplace gating in MToE could further mitigate modality competition and improve routing stability.\n- M3ViT (2210.14793) demonstrates that task-dependent sparse MoE reduces gradient conflicts; positioning your gradient conflict analysis against M3ViT would strengthen claims and suggest architectural synergies.\n- SMEAR (2306.03745) provides fully differentiable expert merging; while different in goal, contrasting routing stability and compute trade-offs would contextualize your design choices.\n- Large multimodal mammography transformers (e.g., MMT/NYU) demonstrate strong cross-modal fusion for detection and long-term risk; referencing them clarifies the clinical landscape and how your approach relates in scope (e.g., simultaneous multi-task learning versus longitudinal modeling).\n- Prompt-expert fusion (MoPE, 2403.10568) and data-free merging (WEMoE, 2402.00433) highlight alternative specialization mechanisms; brief discussion can help frame your expert specialization and interpretability contributions.\n\n- The proposed interpretability (sample- and population-level modality contributions) is clinically valuable but should be presented cautiously: routing weights are a proxy for contribution, not causal evidence. Consider complementary attribution analyses (e.g., intervention by ablating modalities) to validate interpretability claims.\n- Clinical deployment would require calibration, stability under acquisition differences, and bias assessment across demographics; the diverse datasets are a good starting point, but targeted fairness audits are recommended.\n- Computational cost and energy footprint of large expert pools can be a concern in clinical settings; reporting throughput and memory will help practitioners assess deployability.\n\n### Questions for Authors\n\n- In the probability modeling section, why are raw routing scores (XΦ) used to compute P(E|T), P(M|T), and P(M,E|T) instead of normalized dispatch/combine probabilities? Could you provide corrected formulations and results using normalized weights?\n- Do you use any load-balancing/importance regularization to prevent expert collapse (as in standard MoE)? If not, what empirical evidence shows the CMI term is sufficient to guarantee balanced expert utilization?\n- How are the empirical probabilities for I(M;E|T) estimated in practice (per batch vs moving average)? Are gradients backpropagated through the probability estimates? How do you prevent degenerate solutions?\n- What is the computational complexity and memory footprint of MToE as a function of tokens l, modalities m, experts n, and tasks p? Please provide throughput/FLOPs/VRAM for your main configurations and comparisons to baselines.\n- How is the segmentation head implemented? Please detail the decoder architecture, loss functions, and how token features are mapped to spatial resolutions for mask prediction.\n- How do you handle missing modalities at training/inference time? Have you evaluated robustness to missing or corrupted modalities (e.g., modality dropout during training)?\n- What loss weighting strategy across tasks is used (uniform, uncertainty weighting, dynamic reweighting)? Did you experiment with gradient-balancing techniques, and how do results compare?\n- Could you report calibration metrics (ECE/Brier) and confidence intervals for key metrics, particularly on imbalanced risk tasks?\n- Did you evaluate cross-dataset generalization (e.g., train on EMBED, test on RSNA/VinDr) and subgroup performance (e.g., dense vs non-dense breasts)? If so, how do modality contributions and performance vary?\n- Can you compare to or discuss task-conditioned MoE baselines like M3ViT and Laplace-gated FuseMoE, and clarify how your MToE differs or could incorporate such routing to improve stability?\n- In the gradient conflict analysis, how sensitive are the results to the choice of layer and the cosine similarity thresholds? Do you observe consistent reductions across multiple layers?\n- For interpretability, have you validated that the modality contribution estimates correlate with performance changes under modality ablations on a per-sample basis?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper tackles an important and underexplored aspect of multimodal medical AI: dynamic, task-dependent fusion that varies across patients and tasks. The M⁴oE architecture is thoughtful and practically motivated, combining modality-specific and task-conditioned shared experts with an information-theoretic regularizer and offering interpretability hooks. Empirical results are strong across multiple public datasets and tasks, and the accompanying analyses (modality competition, synergy, gradient conflicts) deepen understanding. The main reservations are technical and methodological: the current probability modeling and CMI estimation rely on unnormalized routing scores, which undermines the probabilistic interpretation and could affect both the interpretability claims and the regularization’s efficacy. In addition, computational complexity, baseline fairness, calibration, robustness to missing modalities, and segmentation details need clearer treatment. With these issues addressed—particularly correcting the probabilistic formulations, adding load-balancing, reporting compute and statistical significance, and situating the work more fully among recent MoE-based MTL/fusion approaches—this work would be a strong candidate for a top-tier venue.",

        "text": "# Review Report for IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis manuscript addresses a critical challenge in medical imaging: how to effectively model the dynamic relationships between multiple imaging modalities and multiple clinical tasks. The authors identify two key limitations in existing multi-modal multi-task learning approaches: 1) the inability to capture patient-specific dynamic modality fusion (where the relative importance of different modalities varies across patient subgroups), and 2) the lack of modeling modality-task dependence (where different clinical tasks require different combinations of information from available modalities). To address these issues, the authors propose M⁴oE (Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts), a novel framework that incorporates both Modality-Specific MoE (MSoE) modules and a Modality-Shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module. The MToE component specifically models the joint probability distribution of modalities, experts, and tasks through conditional mutual information loss, enabling dynamic fusion that adapts to both patient characteristics and target tasks. The method demonstrates superior performance across four public medical imaging datasets for breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in multiple metrics including accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC, and DICE scores. Additionally, the framework provides valuable sample-level and population-level interpretability of modality contributions to clinical predictions.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper identifies two clinically important but overlooked problems in medical multi-modal multi-task learning: dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence. These issues are well-motivated with clinical examples from breast imaging and ophthalmology.\n- The M⁴oE framework is novel and well-designed, with the MToE module providing a mathematically sound approach to modeling the joint probability of modalities, experts, and tasks.\n- The extensive evaluation across four diverse medical imaging benchmarks (with different modalities, tasks, and patient populations) provides strong evidence of the method's generalizability and superiority.\n- The interpretability analysis is particularly valuable, showing how the model dynamically allocates modality importance at both population and individual patient levels, which has clear clinical relevance.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The computational complexity and resource requirements are not thoroughly discussed. With 128 experts in the MToE module and 32 experts for each MSoE module, the model is likely much more resource-intensive than baselines, which could limit clinical applicability. The paper mentions hardware (4 NVIDIA A100s and 4 L40s) but lacks specific inference time or memory footprint comparisons.\n- While the paper demonstrates the method's superiority on standard metrics, it doesn't provide analysis of whether the performance gains translate to clinically meaningful improvements (e.g., how many additional cancers might be detected with the proposed method compared to baselines).\n- The conditional mutual information loss formulation (Section 3.3) lacks theoretical justification for why this specific formulation addresses the identified problems. The relationship between the mutual information term and the dynamic fusion properties needs clearer explanation.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- The visualization in Figure 5 (modality contribution) would benefit from clearer labeling of which modalities correspond to which colors in the patient examples.\n- Some sections contain minor grammatical issues that should be addressed (e.g., \"M⁴oE has inherent sample and population level interpretability\" should be \"M⁴oE provides inherent sample and population level interpretability\").\n- The paper would benefit from additional discussion about potential failure modes or scenarios where the approach might not work well (e.g., with highly imbalanced modalities or extremely limited data).\n- The ablation study on α (Figure 7b) shows that performance degrades when α > 0.1, but the paper doesn't explain why this happens or how to choose optimal α values for different applications.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a critical gap in medical multi-modal learning where existing approaches fail to capture dynamic relationships between modalities and tasks. The clinical motivation is strong, with examples showing how modality importance varies by patient characteristics (e.g., breast density affecting which mammography views are most informative). The ability to dynamically adapt fusion strategies could significantly improve diagnostic accuracy in real-world medical settings where patient populations are heterogeneous. The clinical interpretability component adds further value by providing insights into modality contributions that could inform clinical practice. This work has high significance for medical AI research and potential clinical impact.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper introduces several innovative elements. The MToE module with its joint probability modeling of modalities, experts, and tasks is a novel contribution to medical AI. The conditional mutual information loss specifically designed to capture modality-task dependence represents a creative solution to the identified problem. The framework's ability to provide both sample-level and population-level interpretability of modality contributions is also innovative. The approach goes beyond standard multi-modal fusion by explicitly modeling the dynamic aspects of modality utility across patients and tasks.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is comprehensive across four diverse medical imaging datasets covering different anatomical regions, modalities, and clinical tasks. The comparison includes multiple baseline categories: medical AI single-task methods, medical AI multi-task methods, MoE-related baselines, and natural domain multi-modal multi-task methods. The authors include thorough ablation studies and multiple forms of analysis including modality utilization, synergy analysis, gradient conflict mitigation, and interpretability. The paper would be strengthened by additional clinical impact analysis (e.g., how performance improvements translate to clinical outcomes) and more detailed computational efficiency metrics.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides sufficient detail on the method architecture, training procedures, and hyperparameters (128 experts for MToE, 32 for each MSoE, Adam optimizer with lr=1e-4, α=0.05). The datasets used are all public, and the evaluation metrics are standard for the field. The authors mention that additional details are in the appendix, which would be helpful for reproducibility. However, the lack of specific computational resource requirements and inference time metrics reduces reproducibility for resource-constrained settings. The code is not mentioned as being publicly available, which would further enhance reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThe paper presents a significant contribution to medical multi-modal learning with strong technical innovation and thorough evaluation across multiple medical imaging benchmarks. The framework addresses clinically important challenges in dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence that have been overlooked in previous work. The results are compelling, and the interpretability analysis adds substantial value.\n\nHowever, before acceptance, the authors should address the following key points in revision:\n1. Provide computational efficiency analysis including inference time and memory requirements compared to baselines\n2. Add discussion of clinical impact (how performance gains translate to potential clinical benefits)\n3. Clarify the theoretical justification for the conditional mutual information loss formulation\n4. Address the minor issues regarding visualization clarity and grammatical corrections\n\nThese revisions would strengthen the paper significantly while not requiring new experiments. The work is promising and addresses important challenges in medical AI, making it suitable for TMI after these revisions.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the problem of dynamically fusing heterogeneous medical‑image modalities while explicitly modelling task‑dependent modality relations. Existing pipelines often treat modality fusion as a static operation, which can provoke competition between inputs. The authors evaluate their proposal on four public multimodal collections: EMBED, RSNA, and VinDr‑Mammo (mammography) and the GAMMA ophthalmology set. These datasets span breast‑density estimation, cancer‑risk prediction, BI‑RADS categorisation, glaucoma detection, and retinal segmentation. Their M[4]oE architecture couples Modality‑Specific Mixture‑of‑Experts (MSoE) modules that retain modality‑specific representations with a Modality‑Task Mixture‑of‑Experts (MToE) module that learns joint modality‑task distributions via a conditional mutual‑information regulariser. Across all tasks the method reports higher accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC and Dice scores than a suite of baselines. The primary contribution is a multimodal multi‑task MoE framework that purportedly adapts fusion per sample, captures dynamic modality‑task dependencies, and yields interpretable modality contributions at both the individual‑sample and cohort levels.  \n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n*Significance.* Addressing dynamic modality fusion and modality‑task dependence is clinically relevant, particularly for workflows that combine full‑field digital mammography with 2‑D synthetic views, or fundus photography with OCT.  \n\n*Innovation.* The three‑part design—(i) modality‑specific soft MoE, (ii) a task‑conditioned shared MoE, and (iii) a conditional mutual‑information loss that promotes diverse expert‑modality‑task assignments—appears novel within the medical‑imaging literature. The joint probability formulation over modalities, experts, and tasks (Sec. 3.3) differentiates the approach from recent natural‑image MoE variants such as AdaMV‑MoE and Fuse‑MoE.  \n\n*Evaluation.* Results are presented on four heterogeneous datasets covering five tasks, with improvements over strong baselines (MIRAI, AsymMIRAI, EyeMost, etc.) on standard metrics (Table 1). Ablation studies (Table 2) and investigations of expert count and regularisation strength (Fig. 7) support the authors’ design choices. However, the manuscript lacks statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, and any discussion of class imbalance or dataset size effects.  \n\n*Reproducibility.* The code repository is referenced only as a placeholder (“[in XXX]”). Training details are confined to optimiser settings and the number of experts; the exact implementation of the conditional MI loss, hyper‑parameter optimisation, data‑split protocol, and MoE load‑balancing mechanisms are not described, which impedes replication.  \n\n---\n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n1. **Clarity of the probabilistic formulation.** Section 3.3 contains typographical mistakes and ambiguous symbols (e.g., “ϕ ∈ R_[m]×[n]×[p]” without explicit dimensionality). Precise definitions of the dispatch/combine tensors and a step‑by‑step derivation of the MI term are required for reproducibility. *(Fig. 2, Sec. 3.3)*  \n\n2. **Baseline comparability.** It is unspecified whether the baselines were retrained using the same backbone, parameter budget, data‑augmentation pipeline, and optimiser as M[4]oE. Differences in these settings could account for part of the reported gains. Full disclosure of the baseline training procedures is necessary. *(Table 1)*  \n\n3. **Absence of statistical validation.** Table 1 reports only mean values (e.g., 84.0 % for MIRAI vs. 87.6 % for M[4]oE). No confidence intervals, p‑values, or bootstrapped estimates accompany these numbers, making it impossible to judge whether the improvements are statistically reliable. *(Table 1)*  \n\n4. **Depth of ablation analysis.** Table 2 examines the presence or absence of MSoE, MToE, and the MI regulariser, but does not test alternative routing strategies (hard versus soft), varying expert‑slot counts per task, or different sparsity levels. Such experiments would clarify the contribution of each component. *(Table 2, Fig. 7)*  \n\n5. **Interpretability assessment.** The modality‑utilisation visualisations (Figs. 3‑5) are purely qualitative. A quantitative validation—such as correlation with clinician‑provided modality importance scores or established interpretability metrics—would substantiate the claim of sample‑level interpretability. *(Fig. 5)*  \n\n6. **Robustness to missing modalities.** Although the introduction stresses patient‑specific modality quality, none of the experiments simulate absent or corrupted modalities. An experiment where one modality is deliberately dropped or perturbed would demonstrate the method’s resilience in realistic clinical scenarios. *(Dataset description)*  \n\n7. **External clinical validation.** All reported experiments rely on publicly available datasets. Evaluation on an independent clinical cohort would provide stronger evidence of generalisation and real‑world applicability. *(Dataset section)*  \n\n8. **MoE training stability.** The MToE employs 128 experts; literature on large MoE models frequently observes expert collapse or load‑imbalance. The manuscript does not discuss any balancing loss, utilisation statistics, or measures taken to ensure stable training. *(Fig. 7)*  \n\n9. **Code availability and documentation.** The repository link is a placeholder, preventing reviewers from inspecting the implementation. Providing a functional codebase, complete training scripts, and a hyper‑parameter log is essential for reproducibility. *(Abstract, Acknowledgements)*  \n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision**  \n\nThe work introduces an interesting approach to dynamic multimodal fusion, yet the current manuscript lacks essential baseline transparency, statistical validation, and thorough ablation. Substantial revisions are required before the paper can be considered for acceptance.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nIn this paper, the authors proposed a novel framework named the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH-Diffusion) for fMRI analytics. The PDH-Diffusion framework integrates two essential brain physiological properties, hierarchical regional interactions and multifractal dynamics, into the diffusion process. The primary goal is to improve diffusion models’ capability to generate realistic fMRI time series signals by accurately capturing these physiological characteristics.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nOverall, the major strength of this work lies in its novelty. The authors have developed an innovative framework that captures complex interdependencies and multifractal dynamics within synthetic fMRI signals.\n\nSpecifically, their contribution includes integrating three key components into the diffusion process: a hypergraph-based signal generator, a dynamics properties guiding module, and a cross-brain region progressive diffusion model. This integration enhances the realism of the generated signals. The authors provide a robust theoretical foundation for their methods and perform extensive quantitative analysis, demonstrating the framework’s accuracy and effectiveness in time series forecasting. The paper is well-organized and includes relevant background information. Results from the proposed method outperform multiple peer models in time-series forecasting and diffusion models, as evidenced by superior MAE, MAPE, and RMSE scores, highlighting the model’s effectiveness.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe reviewers have multiple concerns about the framework and potential impact in this work. \n\n1). The confusion about physiological fMRI. Usually, fMRI are categorized into resting-state and task-based fMRI. The resting-state fMRI is commonly scanned without specific stimulus, whereas task-based fMRI is acquired based on external stimulus, such as 7 tasks in HCP. Is physiological fMRI is either resting-state or task-based signal? The authors do not clarify the concept even in Introdcution section.\n\n2). Limited motivation and impact. In Abstract, the authors mentioned \"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping brain activity but faces challenges like lengthy acquisition time and sensitivity to patient movement, limiting its clinical and machine learning applications.\" It seems that the authros' work can advance the fMRI for clincial application, but the authors do not generate some neurological or psychiatric fMRI to validate. From reviewers' perspective, using the innovative PDH-Diffusion model, it can assist physician to provide lengthy fMRI signal which will denfinitely reduce the inconvenience of patients. Only generating healthy fMRI can impair the motivation and impact of this work.\n\n3). Lacking of qualitative comparison. The authors have provided an extensive quantitative validation of PDH-Diffusion model with other peer methods using MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. Unfortunately, the autors do not provide any qualitative results, such as Functional Connectivity Map or Brain Connectivity Maps, of PDH-Diffusion. That is, although averaging metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE across 10 runs may demonstrate robustness, these metrics  cannot fully capture the quality or realism of the synthesized fMRI signals. Notably, the qualitative results is also vital in clinics, since these results showcase which brain regions are severly impaired by neurological disorders.  Importantly, there is no visual representation given of the generated fMRI signal, which would be valuable for assessing their plausibility. \n\n4). Several technical issues. The variance schedule (parameters $\\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_n$) in the diffusion process may not be fully optimized for different regions or scales, potentially leading to inappropriate noise levels in certain hierarchical levels. This could result in over-smoothing or overfitting at certain levels. Additionally, conditioning on historical data could lead to overfitting if the model becomes too dependent on past values, especially if the training data does not represent the full spectrum of brain dynamics. Without explicit mitigation measures, such as adaptive variance schedules or regularization techniques, these issues may limit the model’s ability to generalize to new or varied patterns, impacting its robustness and effectiveness.\n\n5). Multiple typographical mistakes. In Section 4.3 (ABLATION ANALYSIS) there are many typographical errors. The term “share radio” is used instead of ‘share ratio’ in “The influence of share radio” this section. Similar typographical errors appear in the caption and text of Figure 3(b), as well as in Section 3.4. These typographical mistakes impair the redability of this paper.\n\n### Questions\n\nThe reviewers have raised several questions regarding the weaknesses of this work:\n\n1). Qualitative Comparisons: The authors are strongly encouraged to provide qualitative comparisons between the synthesized and real fMRI signals to allow for a qualitative assessment of the model’s performance.\n\n2). Optimal Range of Brain Regions: The results suggest an “optimal” range of brain regions that enhances performance. How is this range determined, and is it manually set? Reviewers are concerned about the reliance on manual design for determining this optimal range.\n\n3). Validation of Multifractal Properties: How do the authors validate that the generated signals preserve multifractal properties?\n\n4). Risk of Overfitting: Do the variance schedule parameters ($\\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_n$) and the historical data used in training the PDH-Diffusion model lead to overfitting?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

Its stated goal is to enhance the realism of generated fMRI time‑series signals by faithfully capturing key physiological characteristics. The work is conceptually novel, clearly organized, and supported by extensive quantitative evaluation. However, several conceptual, methodological, and presentation issues limit its overall impact and clarity.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Definition and Context of Physiological fMRI** – The term “physiological fMRI” is not clearly defined. It remains unclear whether it corresponds to resting‑state or task‑based fMRI, and this ambiguity persists even in the Introduction. Clarification is needed to situate the work appropriately within established fMRI categories.  \n2. **Motivation and Practical Impact** – Although the Abstract highlights clinical relevance (e.g., reducing acquisition time and motion sensitivity), the experiments use only synthetic or healthy fMRI data. Without validation on neurological or psychiatric datasets, the clinical applicability of PDH‑Diffusion is uncertain, reducing its motivation and broader impact.  \n3. **Lack of Qualitative Comparison** – The study provides quantitative metrics (MAE, MAPE, RMSE) but omits qualitative results such as functional or brain connectivity maps. These visualizations are important for assessing the physiological plausibility of generated signals and their clinical interpretability.  \n4. **Technical Concerns** – The diffusion variance schedule parameters (αₙ, βₙ) may not be optimized across hierarchical levels, potentially causing over‑smoothing or overfitting. Strong dependence on historical data could also lead to overfitting if training samples are not sufficiently diverse. The paper lacks discussion of adaptive variance or regularization strategies to mitigate these issues.  \n5. **Clarity and Terminology Issues** – The paper contains multiple typographical errors, notably “share radio” instead of “share ratio” in Section 4.3 and Figure 3(b), which detract from readability.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Provide qualitative visualizations comparing synthesized and real fMRI signals.  \n- Explain how the “optimal range” of brain regions is determined and whether it is manually set.  \n- Clarify how multifractal properties of generated signals are validated.  \n- Describe safeguards against overfitting related to variance scheduling.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the manuscript offers an original and theoretically grounded framework that effectively models hierarchical and multifractal properties in fMRI signal generation. The quantitative performance is strong, yet conceptual clarity and empirical breadth are limited. The lack of qualitative analysis, unclear terminology, and potential overfitting concerns restrict confidence in the model’s generalizability and practical impact.

Then, the authors validated the feasibility of synthesized fMRI data by comparing it to other generative mechanisms. The scientific merit of this work mainly comes from the conceptual advances in their proposed algorithm. It is indeed challenging to synthesize realistic fMRI data while preserving unique aspects of the brain system. The authors combined three different modules, each serving different roles, to synthesize brain dynamics with preserved network-like structure and fractal components. Given results of the extensive validation experiment on the large fMRI cohort, the validity of the proposed algorithm is clear; yet, the scientific significance of this work is somewhat limited as there was no experiment demonstrating the practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe major originality of this study comes from its conceptual advances embedded in the proposed algorithm. It is indeed challenging to synthesize realistic fMRI data while preserving unique aspects of the brain system. The quality and clarity of the models in the main text are reasonably strong as well.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe major concern comes from the unclear significance of this work. As the authors argued in the Introduction, acquisition of fMRI is expensive. Thus, synthesizing fMRI signal can be tempting. Although expensive, real fMRI data reflects unique information of individuals. This study, however, was not able to demonstrate the synthesized fMRI still convey unique information of subjects. Slight improvement in forecasting future timepoints of fMRI signal does not suggest the significance or practical usefulness of the model. This works needs additional analysis or applications highlighting the unique advantage of the synthesized fMRI data from the proposed model.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In table 1, does “T_Pred=32 or 64” mean predicting 32 or 64 time points of fMRI data?\n2. If my speculation in the former question is right, it is counter-intuitive that forecasting more time points (96 vs. 32) did not lead to an increase in errors. Please clarify this. \n3. According to Fig 1, it looks like the resolution of synthesized data is bounded to the level of ROI. It is more desirable to synthesize fMRI dynamics at the level of vertex. Is the proposed method able to be applied at the vertex level as well?     \n4.

        "text": "**PHASE 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to IEEE TMI**  \n✅ The paper clearly targets methodological innovation in medical imaging, introducing a new generative modeling framework for *fMRI signal synthesis and forecasting*. It intertwines imaging physics–inspired priors (functional connectivity and fractal dynamics) with modern diffusion-based generative modeling. This lies squarely within TMI’s interest in imaging reconstruction, signal modeling, and quantitative imaging theory.  \n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe “Physiological Dynamics–Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH‑Diffusion)” is an ambitious method integrating multiple physiological priors into a generative diffusion model. There is meaningful novelty in:\n- Coupling functional connectivity–derived *hypergraph structures* with diffusion processes.  \n- Embedding *multifractal dynamics* (generalized Hurst exponent, multifractal spectrum) as explicit conditioning signals.  \n- Using a *progressive multi‑scale diffusion chain* guided by brain‑region hierarchies.  \n\nThe conceptual integration surpasses standard diffusion‑time‑series applications, though the core diffusion machinery is known. Methodological contribution is thus moderate‑to‑strong; the main innovation lies in the *physiological conditioning design*.  \n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe paper is technically dense and mathematically coherent. Derivations of fractal properties are thorough. Experimental validation uses the HCP dataset; the training pipeline and baselines are well‑chosen. However, shortcomings include:\n- Limited discussion of how “physiologically realistic” generation is quantitatively validated beyond forecasting metrics (MAE/RMSE/MAPE).  \n- Absence of uncertainty estimates, reproducibility statistics, or clinical interpretability analysis.  \n- Lack of details about subject variability, test–retest reliability, or whether generated fMRI preserve spatial–temporal physiological realism beyond numeric metrics.  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nGenerally well structured, albeit verbose. Figures are helpful but the writing could be tightened for readability. Derivations may be too detailed for TMI’s page format; clearer schematic flowcharts of the pipeline and loss functions would help.  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nThe dataset (HCP) is public and anonymized; code availability is promised via GitHub. No direct patient study occurs—minimal ethical concern observed.\n\n\n---\n\n**PHASE 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary (in reviewer’s words)**  \nThe authors propose *PDH‑Diffusion*, a hierarchical diffusion model that synthesizes realistic fMRI time‑series. The model fuses three components: (i) a hypergraph‑based hierarchical signal generator modeling multi‑scale functional connectivity among regions; (ii) a dynamics‑guiding module that enforces multifractal temporal behavior via predicted spectra and Hurst exponents; and (iii) a cross‑region progressive diffusion process where coarse‑scale regional trends guide fine‑scale generation. Evaluated on the Human Connectome Project dataset, PDH‑Diffusion reportedly surpasses transformer and diffusion baselines in MAE/RMSE/MAPE metrics.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Strong methodological concept embedding *neurophysiological priors* into machine learning generation.  \n- Mathematically consistent link between fractal brain dynamics and diffusion conditioning.  \n- Clear ablation study validating the role of each module.  \n- Open‑source intent and usage of a widely recognized dataset.  \n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Evaluation metrics focus on generic time‑series accuracy, not physiological or spatial realism; missing evaluation of dynamic functional connectivity preservation.  \n- Clinical or acquisition‑time reduction claims are speculative without empirical evidence.  \n- Hyperparameters and model reproducibility details (e.g., initialization, computational cost) are sparse.  \n- Writing density and formula presentation may impede accessibility for imaging readers.  \n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Validation of physiological realism:** Move beyond numerical forecasting errors; include comparisons of fractal spectra, power‑law slopes, or rsFC statistics between generated and real signals to support the “physiologically realistic” claim.  \n2. **Empirical link to acquisition efficiency:** If the model intends to reduce fMRI acquisition time, demonstrate reconstruction/denoising from undersampled or partial scans rather than only forecasting.  \n3. **Ablation breadth:** Provide qualitative visualization (temporal correlations, autocorrelation, PSD comparisons) to reveal how each module preserves dynamic structure.  \n4. **Reproducibility:** Clarify computational cost per subject, diffusion steps, total parameter count, and inference time.  \n5. **Manuscript condensation:** The theoretical exposition on fractal dynamics (Section 2) is excessive; condensing or relocating into supplementary material would improve readability.  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Figures 1–2: increase font size; delineate modules with clearer color coding.  \n- Verify consistency in notation (e.g., \\(R\\), \\(r\\), \\(σ_r\\)) across sections.  \n- Reference formatting shows unescaped LaTeX; conform to IEEE style.  \n- Typographical errors (“A P HYSIOLOGI -CAL”, “b y r esting-state”) should be corrected.  \n- Future directions could mention potential adaptation to BOLD reconstruction from partially sampled k‑space.  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.**  \nThe work fits TMI’s methodological scope and demonstrates interesting novelty by fusing physiological priors with diffusion modeling. However, the current validation and exposition require significant strengthening—particularly quantitative physiological evaluation, clarity of contributions, and evidence for claimed acquisition efficiency—to meet TMI standards.\n\n**7.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThe paper addresses fMRI acquisition challenges including lengthy scan times and motion sensitivity by proposing the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH-Diffusion) for generating realistic fMRI signals. The method integrates two key brain physiological properties: hierarchical regional interactions modeled through hypergraphs based on resting-state functional connectivity, and multifractal dynamics captured via generalized Hurst exponents and multifractal spectra. The framework comprises three components: a Hypergraph-based Hierarchical Signals Generator that aggregates fMRI signals across multiple spatial scales, a Dynamics Properties Guiding Module that predicts multifractal characteristics to guide diffusion generation, and a Cross-brain Region Guiding Progressive Diffusion Model that uses broader regional signals to condition localized signal generation. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to time series forecasting methods and existing diffusion models across prediction horizons of 32, 64, and 96 timesteps, with ablation studies confirming the contribution of each proposed component.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - Equation 1 defines scale-free property with β≥0 but subsequent derivations assume specific relationships without clear justification (Page 3, Section 2.2)\n  - The transition from Equation 2 to Equation 3 lacks mathematical rigor in establishing the self-similarity property, particularly the equality of finite dimensional distributions notation (Page 3)\n  - Equation 9 combines MSE and KL divergence losses without theoretical justification for this specific combination or guidance on relative weighting (Page 7)\n  - Notation inconsistencies appear throughout, such as using both X(t) and Y(t) for time series without clear distinction of their roles (Pages 3-4)\n\n• **Insufficient experimental validation and baseline comparisons**\n  - Limited to single dataset (HCP) evaluation without cross-dataset validation to demonstrate generalizability (Page 8, Section 4.1)\n  - Missing comparisons with recent fMRI-specific generation methods, focusing only on general time series forecasting and two diffusion models (Table 1, Page 9)\n  - No statistical significance testing reported for performance differences, making it difficult to assess the reliability of claimed improvements (Table 1)\n  - Evaluation metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE) are standard forecasting measures but lack fMRI-specific quality assessments such as functional connectivity preservation or physiological plausibility measures (Page 8)\n\n• **Limited technical novelty and methodological concerns**\n  - Hypergraph construction relies on standard k-hop neighbor methods without novel contributions to brain connectivity modeling (Page 6, Section 3.2)\n  - The multifractal analysis uses established MFDFA techniques without methodological advances (Page 6, Section 3.3)\n  - Progressive diffusion concept is borrowed from existing multi-granularity approaches with limited adaptation to brain-specific requirements (Page 7, Section 3.4)\n  - The integration of multiple conditioning inputs lacks theoretical foundation for why this specific combination is optimal for fMRI generation (Figure 1, Page 5)\n\n• **Incomplete evaluation of physiological realism**\n  -

The framework includes hypergraph-based hierarchical signal generation, a dynamics-guided diffusion module, and a cross-region progressive conditioning mechanism.

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript proposes a novel framework, the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH-Diffusion), for generating realistic fMRI time series signals. The framework integrates two key aspects of brain fMRI signals: hierarchical regional interactions modeled via hypergraphs and multifractal dynamics. By incorporating these physiological properties, the authors aim to generate fMRI signals that are more physiologically realistic, potentially reducing acquisition time and enhancing data quality. The manuscript is well-written and provides a thorough background on the challenges faced by traditional fMRI signal generation methods.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the integration of hierarchical regional interactions and multifractal dynamics into the diffusion model is innovative, the manuscript does not sufficiently differentiate this work from existing literature on hierarchical and multifractal modeling in fMRI. The authors should clarify how their approach differs from other recent works that also consider brain network dynamics and multifractal characteristics.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experimental evaluation is primarily conducted on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset, which is standard but limited. The authors should consider validating their model on additional datasets, including those from different populations or conditions, to strengthen the generalizability of their findings. Furthermore, the inclusion of a prospective validation study would be beneficial.\n\n3. Comparisons: The comparison with baseline methods is thorough, but the manuscript should include additional diffusion-based models and recent advancements in time series generation that explicitly consider physiological dynamics. This would help establish the relative improvement of the proposed method over state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n4. Reproducibility: Although the authors mention that the code will be made available, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the preprocessing steps, hyperparameter tuning, and specific implementation choices. Providing a more comprehensive methodology section would enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 3 and 4 could be improved by adding more representative slices with zoomed-in regions to enhance readability.\n   \n2. Notation Consistency: The notation for the forward operator is inconsistent throughout the manuscript. Standardizing the notation would improve clarity.\n   \n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without being defined initially, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the field.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors, such as \"k-spacce\" (page 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (page 7), should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge in fMRI signal generation by proposing a novel framework that integrates hierarchical regional interactions and multifractal dynamics into a diffusion model. The innovation is noteworthy, as it aims to generate fMRI signals that are more physiologically realistic. However, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and while the method shows promising results, broader validation is necessary to establish its generalizability. The reproducibility of the approach is also uncertain due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, the manuscript has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the field, but it requires additional validation and more detailed documentation to meet the rigorous standards of TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, strengthen validation across different datasets and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "## SYNTHESIZING REALISTIC FMRI: A PHYSIOLOGICAL DYNAMICS-DRIVEN HIERARCHICAL DIFFUSION MODEL FOR EFFICIENT FMRI ACQUISITION\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes PDH-Diffusion, a diffusion-based framework tailored to fMRI time-series generation/forecasting that explicitly injects two neuroscientific priors into the denoising process: multi-scale inter-regional interactions via a hypergraph-based hierarchical signals generator (HHSG) constructed from resting-state functional connectivity, and scale-invariant temporal dynamics via a dynamics properties guiding module (DPGM) that predicts multifractal descriptors (generalized Hurst exponent H(q) and multifractal spectrum f(α)). A progressive, cross-region conditioning scheme guides finer-grained regional synthesis using coarser aggregated signals. On HCP resting-state data, PDH-Diffusion outperforms several time-series baselines and two diffusion baselines on point-wise forecasting metrics, with ablations suggesting each proposed component contributes to performance.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntegrates hypergraph-based multi-scale spatial aggregation with diffusion, aligning with the known hierarchical organization of brain networks.Introduces multifractal dynamics as an explicit conditioning/guidance signal in time-series diffusion, a physiologically motivated design for fMRI.Proposes a progressive cross-region conditioning strategy that cascades coarse-scale dynamics to finer scales within the diffusion process.\n- Experimental rigor and validationConducts ablations removing HHSG, DPGM, and the cross-region progressive module, each showing notable degradation.Studies sensitivity to conditioning weights and to the “share ratio” in the progressive diffusion schedule, indicating some attention to hyperparameter effects.\n- Clarity of presentationProvides clear high-level modular decomposition (HHSG, DPGM, progressive diffusion), with a reasonably intuitive narrative on why each component is needed.Includes preliminaries that situate fractal/multifractal properties and self-similarity, useful for readers outside the neuroimaging dynamics community.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses an important pain point for fMRI acquisition and downstream ML: reducing effective scan burden and preserving physiologically meaningful characteristics of BOLD signals.If validated, the approach could impact both clinical and research workflows by enabling higher-quality imputations/forecasts and potentially shorter acquisitions.\n\n- Integrates hypergraph-based multi-scale spatial aggregation with diffusion, aligning with the known hierarchical organization of brain networks.\n- Introduces multifractal dynamics as an explicit conditioning/guidance signal in time-series diffusion, a physiologically motivated design for fMRI.\n- Proposes a progressive cross-region conditioning strategy that cascades coarse-scale dynamics to finer scales within the diffusion process.\n\n- Conducts ablations removing HHSG, DPGM, and the cross-region progressive module, each showing notable degradation.\n- Studies sensitivity to conditioning weights and to the “share ratio” in the progressive diffusion schedule, indicating some attention to hyperparameter effects.\n\n- Provides clear high-level modular decomposition (HHSG, DPGM, progressive diffusion), with a reasonably intuitive narrative on why each component is needed.\n- Includes preliminaries that situate fractal/multifractal properties and self-similarity, useful for readers outside the neuroimaging dynamics community.\n\n- Addresses an important pain point for fMRI acquisition and downstream ML: reducing effective scan burden and preserving physiologically meaningful characteristics of BOLD signals.\n- If validated, the approach could impact both clinical and research workflows by enabling higher-quality imputations/forecasts and potentially shorter acquisitions.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsPotential information leakage in constructing the rsFC-derived graph/hypergraphs: it is unclear whether FC is computed using all time points (including the forecast window) for each subject, which would contaminate forecasting experiments.The hypergraph construction is deterministic (thresholded rsFC + k-hop neighborhoods) and message passing is a single-step mean aggregation; this may limit expressivity and collapses to smoothing without learning high-order structures or weights.The DPGM is trained with multifractal targets computed on the future window, but there is no explicit evaluation that generated series actually match multifractal properties or PSD slopes.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesClaims about “physiologically realistic” and “reducing acquisition time” are not directly validated: no downstream analyses (e.g., FC preservation, network metrics, spectral/multifractal fidelity, behavioral/clinical endpoints) or truncated-scan simulations demonstrate practical acquisition savings.Baseline coverage is incomplete for diffusion time-series forecasting: omits strong and recent methods such as TimeDiff, CCDM, WaveStitch, and CSDI; also lacks graph-aware forecasting baselines (e.g., DCRNN, STGCN) and fMRI-specific dynamic models.Metrics focus on point accuracy (MAE, RMSE, MAPE), which are not fully informative for fMRI where temporal/spectral structure and inter-regional correlation preservation are paramount.No uncertainty-aware evaluation (e.g., CRPS) despite using a generative model.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesInconsistent ROI counts (82 vs 86); key construction details are missing (FC threshold, k values per scale, diffusion denoiser architecture, diffusion steps, sampling strategy).Some preliminaries have notation/rendering errors that obscure derivations (e.g., Eq. 3).The Flowformer baseline cited appears to be from optical flow; if a time-series variant was used, this needs clarification.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited engagement with recent diffusion-for-time-series literature (TimeDiff 2023; CCDM 2024; WaveStitch 2025) and hypergraph/fMRI works that learn higher-order structures (e.g., HA-STA 2025) and multiscale graph modeling (MAHGCN).No discussion of frequency band or scale-aware fMRI models (e.g., MBBN), which also incorporate scale-free dynamics.\n\n- Potential information leakage in constructing the rsFC-derived graph/hypergraphs: it is unclear whether FC is computed using all time points (including the forecast window) for each subject, which would contaminate forecasting experiments.\n- The hypergraph construction is deterministic (thresholded rsFC + k-hop neighborhoods) and message passing is a single-step mean aggregation;

However:Hypergraph design: constructing hyperedges as k-hop neighborhoods from thresholded FC and then applying one-step mean updates risks over-smoothing and may not capture higher-order synchrony beyond pairwise FC neighborhoods. Consider learnable hyperedge masks/weights, attention-based aggregation over hyperedges, and multi-step message passing to better capture high-order dependencies.Dynamics module: predicting H(q) and f(α) from history is sensible for conditioning, but the loss alone does not ensure that the generated trajectories exhibit the same multifractal characteristics. A consistency regularizer comparing generated vs. target multifractal descriptors would close the loop.Progressive diffusion: the share-ratio schedule and cross-region conditioning follow prior multi-granularity diffusion ideas; more formal justification or ablation controlling for parameter count would strengthen the claim that gains come from the proposed physiology-inspired hierarchy rather than extra capacity.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentForecasting-only evaluation with MAE/RMSE/MAPE is insufficient to support claims about physiological realism. Strongly recommended additions:Dynamics fidelity: compare generated vs. ground-truth PSD slopes (β), H(q) curves, multifractal spectra f(α), and their deviations per ROI. Report distributional distances (e.g., KL/Wasserstein) and correlation of descriptors across ROIs.Connectivity preservation: compute FC (and dynamic FC) from generated tails vs. true tails; quantify similarity using geometry-aware distances (e.g., Venkatesh et al., 2020), matrix correlation, and effects on graph metrics (modularity, efficiency, small-worldness).Downstream utility: test whether replacing the last X% of a scan with generated data preserves performance on standard tasks (e.g., sex classification, fluid intelligence regression) or clinical classification; compare with simply shortening the scan and not imputing.Uncertainty: report CRPS and calibration of predictive intervals, especially given the clinical framing.Baselines:Include competitive diffusion forecasters: TimeDiff (autoregressive init + future mixup), CCDM (contrastive conditional diffusion), WaveStitch (inference-time conditioning). Also consider CSDI and SSSD with recent refinements.Include graph-aware time-series baselines (DCRNN, STGCN, GTS) and fMRI-specific models where applicable.Robustness:Clarify whether rsFC used to build graphs/hypergraphs is computed only from the conditioning window or from training-set templates; avoid using future windows to prevent leakage. Provide a variant using a group-average FC and another using history-only FC to show robustness.Report standard deviations and statistical significance over multiple runs; current tables present only means.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Time-series diffusion: Compared to TimeDiff (2306.05043), CCDM (2410.02168), and WaveStitch (2503.06231), the proposed conditioning is physiologically grounded (hypergraph hierarchy and multifractal dynamics) rather than purely algorithmic (future mixup, contrastive training, inference-time guidance). However, these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art forecasting performance, efficient sampling, and strong conditioning strategies; omitting them weakens the empirical case. Incorporating some of their conditioning or sampling ideas (e.g., efficient solvers, contrastive regularization) might reduce steps and improve generalization.fMRI hypergraph/hierarchical modeling: HA-STA (2505.12068) learns sparse higher-order structures with an information bottleneck; MAHGCN (2209.11232) uses atlas-based multiscale pooling. In contrast, this paper uses fixed rsFC-derived k-hop hyperedges and mean aggregation. Learning hyperedge masks/weights, sparsity constraints, or attention could produce richer and more interpretable multi-scale structures aligned with HA-STA’s insights.Scale-aware brain modeling: MBBN (2503.23394) explicitly models frequency bands tied to scale-free dynamics and reports interpretable band-specific patterns. While PDH-Diffusion emphasizes multifractality, it does not analyze band-resolved behavior of generated series. A frequency-resolved evaluation (band-wise PSDs or β exponents) would make the physiological claim more concrete.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significancePotential: If the model can accurately extend or repair fMRI sequences while preserving inter-regional structure and multifractal dynamics, it could reduce required acquisition time, mitigate motion-corrupted segments, and improve the utility of datasets for machine learning and clinical decision support.Risks: Over-claiming acquisition-time reduction without direct validation; reliance on rsFC from the same subject may inadvertently encode future information; synthetic data may obscure pathophysiological signals if used indiscriminately. Strong validation and transparent release (code, seeds, preprocessing scripts) are important.\n\n- The overall idea—to align diffusion generation with spatial hierarchy and scale-invariant temporal dynamics—is well motivated.

Is it computed from the entire subject time series (which would include future), only from the observed conditioning window, or from a group-average template learned on the training set? Please clarify and, if needed, re-run to eliminate leakage.\n- Can you provide explicit evaluations showing that generated sequences preserve PSD slopes, H(q) curves, and multifractal spectra f(α), per ROI and at the group level? How close are these descriptors between generated and ground truth, and how does DPGM influence this gap?\n- What is the denoiser architecture (layers, hidden sizes, conditioning mechanism such as concatenation vs adaLN, diffusion steps at train/inference, sampler used)? What is the runtime compared to autoregressive forecasters and to efficient diffusion forecasters (e.g., TimeDiff)?\n- Which thresholds and k values are used to build the rsFC graph and the k-hop hypergraphs at each scale? How sensitive are results to these choices, and do you use any hyperedge weighting or attention?\n- Did you control for parameter count in the ablations (e.g., replace removed modules with capacity-matched alternatives) to ensure improvements are due to the proposed mechanisms rather than added capacity or auxiliary losses?\n- Why were strong diffusion baselines such as TimeDiff, CCDM, WaveStitch, and CSDI omitted? Can you include them, along with graph-aware time-series baselines, in a revised comparison?\n- To substantiate acquisition-time reduction, can you evaluate downstream tasks (e.g., sex classification, fluid intelligence regression) when the last X% of the scan is replaced by generated data, and quantify FC/dFC preservation and biomarker stability?\n- MAPE can be misleading for BOLD signals with large means and small relative fluctuations. Can you add correlation, R^2, spectral distance, and FC similarity metrics to better reflect neuroscientific fidelity?\n- There is an inconsistency in ROI counts (82 vs 86) and unclear preprocessing details. Can you clarify parcellation, node exclusions, motion scrubbing, normalization, and windowing strategy used to construct train/test samples?\n- The repository link is a placeholder. Will code, preprocessing scripts, and hyperparameter settings be released to ensure reproducibility?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe paper tackles an important and timely problem—physiologically faithful generation/forecasting of fMRI time series—by injecting domain priors into diffusion via multi-scale hypergraph aggregation and multifractal dynamics conditioning. Conceptually, this is a promising direction and the modular design is appealing. However, the experimental validation is currently narrower than the claims: results are limited to point-forecasting errors without demonstrating preservation of critical neuroscientific properties (spectral/multifractal signatures, FC/dFC structure) or practical acquisition-time savings. There are also methodological clarity concerns (possible FC leakage, missing architectural/diffusion details) and baseline gaps relative to modern diffusion forecasters and graph-aware models. With rigorous leakage-free experiments, physiology-aware evaluations, stronger baselines, and clearer implementation details, this work could become a compelling contribution at the intersection of diffusion models and neuroimaging. As it stands, it shows promise but needs a more comprehensive and neuroscientifically grounded evaluation to reach a top-tier standard.",

        "text": "# Review Report for IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis manuscript addresses the critical challenge of lengthy acquisition time and patient movement sensitivity in fMRI scanning, which limit its clinical utility and machine learning applications. The authors propose a novel Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH-Diffusion) that integrates two key physiological properties of brain activity into the diffusion framework: hierarchical regional interactions and multifractal dynamics. The solution comprises three core components: (1) a Hypergraph-based Hierarchical Signals Generator that models complex brain connectivity across multiple scales, (2) a Dynamics Properties Guiding Module that incorporates multifractal characteristics of fMRI signals into the diffusion process, and (3) a Cross-brain Region Guiding Progressive Diffusion Model that enables progressive generation from broader to more localized brain regions. The experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art time series forecasting and diffusion-based methods on the HCP dataset, with the proposed approach achieving lower MAE (28.56 vs. 29.36 for best baseline at Tpred=32), RMSE, and MAPE metrics across multiple prediction horizons. The visualizations confirm the model's ability to generate physiologically realistic fMRI signals that preserve complex temporal patterns.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths\n- **Physiologically grounded approach**: The integration of two fundamental brain properties (hierarchical connectivity and multifractal dynamics) into the diffusion framework addresses a critical gap in existing generative models that typically ignore these physiological characteristics.\n- **Innovative hypergraph-based hierarchical modeling**: The progressive construction of hypergraphs at multiple scales (Figure 2) provides a biologically meaningful way to capture brain regional interactions that standard graph approaches cannot represent.\n- **Comprehensive ablation studies**: The paper provides thorough ablation analysis (Table 2) that quantitatively demonstrates the contribution of each component to the overall performance.\n- **Physiological validation**: The weight sensitivity analysis (Figure 4a) shows the importance of both multifractal and cross-brain region conditions, with optimal weights that align with physiological expectations.\n\n### Major Limitations\n- **Lack of physiological validation metrics**: While the paper demonstrates numerical superiority in standard forecasting metrics, it lacks specialized validation metrics that specifically assess physiological realism (e.g., functional connectivity preservation, power spectrum analysis, or fractal dimension consistency).\n- **Insufficient comparison to medical imaging generative models**: The baselines focus primarily on time series forecasting methods without adequate comparison to medical imaging-specific generative models that might be more relevant for fMRI synthesis.\n- **Limited clinical relevance demonstration**: The paper doesn't clearly demonstrate how the generated fMRI signals would translate to improved clinical outcomes or diagnostic capabilities, which is essential for medical imaging applications.\n\n### Minor Strengths\n- **Clear visualizations**: The framework diagrams (Figure 1) and hypergraph construction (Figure 2) effectively communicate the complex methodology.\n- **Theoretical grounding**: The paper provides solid theoretical background on multifractal analysis and hypergraph construction, supporting the technical approach.\n- **Parameter sensitivity analysis**: The thorough exploration of share ratios (Figure 4b) and brain region range settings (Table 3) demonstrates thoughtful model design.\n\n### Minor Limitations\n- **Implementation details**: Some implementation details of the diffusion process (e.g., exact architecture of the denoising network) are not fully specified.\n- **Computational efficiency**: The paper doesn't discuss the computational requirements of the proposed approach compared to baselines, which is important for practical clinical deployment.\n- **Figure 5 interpretation**: The 3D surface plot in Figure 5 would benefit from additional explanation to clarify the relationship between share ratios and brain region ranges.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Against TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance**: The problem addressed is highly significant for medical imaging, as fMRI acquisition time and motion sensitivity directly impact clinical feasibility and diagnostic quality. The proposed solution has potential to enable shorter scans, reduce motion artifacts, and expand fMRI applications in clinical settings. However, the paper could better articulate the specific clinical pathways through which this technology would impact patient care.\n\n**Innovation**: The work demonstrates strong innovation by integrating two physiological properties (hierarchical connectivity and multifractal dynamics) that have not been previously combined in fMRI generation. The hypergraph-based hierarchical modeling approach represents a novel application of hypergraph theory to fMRI signal generation, and the progressive diffusion framework with cross-brain region guidance is conceptually distinctive. The innovation is well-grounded in neuroscience literature.\n\n**Evaluation**: The experimental evaluation is methodologically sound with appropriate datasets (HCP), comprehensive metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE), and thorough ablation studies. However, the evaluation lacks domain-specific validation metrics that would demonstrate physiological realism beyond numerical forecasting accuracy. The comparison to baselines is comprehensive for time series forecasting but insufficient for medical imaging applications. The statistical significance of results across multiple runs is appropriately reported.\n\n**Reproducibility**: The paper provides sufficient methodological detail for replication, including clear descriptions of the three core components, training procedures, and hyperparameter settings. The code availability statement (though with placeholder URL) supports reproducibility. However, some implementation details of the diffusion network architecture could be more specific, and the precise preprocessing steps for the HCP dataset could be elaborated for full reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nMinor Revision\n\nThe manuscript presents a novel and methodologically sound approach to fMRI signal generation with strong potential clinical impact. The work is technically rigorous and demonstrates clear superiority over existing methods on standard forecasting metrics. However, to meet TMI's standards for medical imaging research, the authors should address the major limitations related to physiological validation metrics and clinical relevance demonstration. I recommend minor revision with specific attention to:\n1) Adding domain-specific validation metrics that assess the physiological fidelity of generated signals\n2) Including comparisons to medical imaging-specific generative models where applicable\n3) Clarifying the clinical pathway and potential impact on diagnostic capabilities\n\nThe theoretical foundation, experimental design, and core contributions are strong, and with these revisions, the paper would make a valuable contribution to the medical imaging literature.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe authors address the well‑known limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) – long scan times and susceptibility to motion – by proposing a generative framework that aims to produce realistic resting‑state time series. Using the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database, they extract 86 cortical regions from 900 participants, yielding 696 training and 174 test samples. Each sample consists of an 86 × 1200 matrix; the model receives a context window of 64 time points and predicts 32, 64, or 96 steps ahead.  \n\nThe proposed Physiological Dynamics‑Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model contains three parts: (1) a hypergraph‑based hierarchical generator that aggregates regional signals according to resting‑state functional connectivity (rsFC); (2) a dynamics‑properties module that predicts the multifractal spectrum and generalized Hurst exponent to condition the diffusion process; and (3) a cross‑brain‑region progressive diffusion scheme that refines coarse‑scale outputs into fine‑scale detail. On the HCP test set the authors report lower mean absolute error (MAE), root‑mean‑square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) than several baseline time‑series forecasters and diffusion models across all prediction horizons. The stated contribution is a diffusion‑based generator that embeds rsFC and multifractal dynamics to produce physiologically plausible fMRI signals.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n* **Significance.** The problem of generating realistic fMRI data is relevant for data augmentation and for reducing acquisition burden.  \n* **Innovation.** Combining a hypergraph representation of rsFC with multifractal‑guided diffusion is uncommon in the fMRI literature.  \n* **Evaluation.** Quantitative forecasting improvements are demonstrated on a large HCP cohort, but the study lacks statistical testing, external validation, and any assessment of whether the generated signals preserve functional connectivity patterns.  \n* **Reproducibility.** The authors promise to release code, yet critical implementation details (e.g., rsFC threshold, k‑hop parameters, diffusion schedule, loss weighting ωᵣ, share ratios σ, optimizer settings) are omitted, and the provided GitHub link is a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n1. **Hypergraph construction.** The manuscript shows Figure 2 to illustrate the hypergraph, but it never specifies the numeric rsFC threshold or the list of k‑hop distances used to define hyperedges. Without these numbers the construction cannot be reproduced.  \n\n2. **Baseline selection.** Only generic time‑series forecasters and two diffusion models (TimeGrad, SSSD) are used for comparison. Recent fMRI‑specific generative approaches—GANs, VAEs, flow‑based models—or state‑of‑the‑art medical‑image diffusion frameworks are absent, which makes it difficult to judge whether the proposed method truly advances the field.  \n\n3. **Statistical significance.** Table 1 lists mean MAE, RMSE, and MAPE values but provides no confidence intervals, p‑values, or other hypothesis‑test results. Consequently it is unclear whether the reported improvements are statistically robust.  \n\n4. **Dataset limitation.** All experiments are confined to the HCP dataset. No external cohort (e.g., ADNI, clinical patient data) is used to test generalisation, leaving the transferability of the model unverified.  \n\n5. **Ablation design.** The ablation in Table 2 removes the hypergraph module altogether, replacing it with no hierarchical structure rather than with a plain graph‑based baseline. This design does not isolate the specific benefit of hypergraph versus graph aggregation.  \n\n6. **Multifractal predictor details.** The architecture of the RNN encoder that predicts the multifractal spectrum, the optimizer type, learning‑rate schedule, and the weighting γ between MSE and KL terms are not reported. These omissions hinder replication and make it difficult to assess the impact of the dynamics‑conditioning component.  \n\n7. **Computational cost.** No information is given on training time, memory requirements, or inference speed. For any potential clinical or real‑time application, such metrics are essential.  \n\n8. **Downstream utility.** The authors claim that the model could aid diagnosis or reduce acquisition time, yet no experiments are presented to substantiate these claims (e.g., training a classifier on synthetic versus real data, or measuring preservation of rsFC patterns in the generated series).  \n\n9. **Code availability.** The cited repository URL (“https://github.com/XXX”) does not resolve to a functional location, which impedes reproducibility and verification of the reported results.  \n\n10. **Presentation issues.** Numerous typographical errors (broken symbols, inconsistent notation such as “Physiological##”, “_∗_”) distract from the content and should be corrected before publication.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision.** The manuscript presents an interesting idea, but the lack of adequate baselines, statistical validation, external testing, and essential implementation details makes the current evidence insufficient for acceptance. The authors should address the points above before the paper can be reconsidered.",

This study addresses these challenges by generating lesion-containing image-segmentation pairs from lesion-free images. Previous efforts in medical imaging synthesis have struggled with separating lesion information from background, resulting in low-quality backgrounds and limited control over the synthetic output. Inspired by diffusion-based image inpainting, we propose LeFusion, a lesion-focused diffusion model. By redesigning the diffusion learning objectives to focus on lesion areas, we simplify the learning process and improve control over the output while preserving high-fidelity backgrounds by integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. Additionally, we tackle two major challenges in lesion texture synthesis: 1) multi-peak and 2) multi-class lesions. We introduce two effective strategies: histogram-based texture control and multi-channel decomposition, enabling the controlled generation of high-quality lesions in difficult scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate lesion mask diffusion, allowing control over lesion size, location, and boundary, thus increasing lesion diversity. Validated on 3D cardiac lesion MRI and lung nodule CT datasets, LeFusion-generated data significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models, including nnUNet and SwinUNETR.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a novel 3D lesion inpainting method, LeFusion, which uses diffusion models to address data scarcity in medical imaging. Its primary aim is to generate synthetic lesions in lung CT and cardiac MRI scans for augmenting training data in lesion segmentation tasks. The approach is validated through both visual quality assessments and data augmentation derived segmentation \n\nperformance improvement. Three key contributions can be summarised below: \nLeFusion Model: The authors identify that existing lesion inpainting methods struggle to preserve anatomically accurate backgrounds alongside the inpainted lesion, remarking that modelling the former is both hard and unnecessary. LeFusion is introduced to address this challenge incorporating two distinct features: (a) Training on a lesion focused diffusion loss, which only considers the lesion region. (b) Preserving the background at inference time with RePaint [1] by generating the lesion separately, while integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. This design yields realistic lesions, better preserved backgrounds and improves data augmentation outcomes in both CT and MRI compared to non-lesion-specific models (Cond-Diffusion) both with and without RePaint based sampling. \n\nModality-Specific Variants: Two specialized variants are introduced to address modality-specific challenges. LeFusion-H uses histogram-based conditioning to capture diverse lesion textures in CT, succesfully solving the texture mode collapse observed for the baseline LeFusion. LeFusion-J models multiple tissue subtypes in MRI via multi-channel decomposition, which enables the joint generation of different lesion tissue types typically observed in cardiac lesions. Both variants demonstrate superior data augmentation effectiveness in their respective modalities. \n\nDiffMask for Mask Generation: All variants of LeFusion rely on either existing real masks or handcrafted ones as priors for generating lesions in healthy scans. As a more flexible alternative, DiffMask is a diffusion model that generates synthetic lesion masks from basic spatial constraints, defined as a sphere with user specified location and size. Using the generated masks for data augmentation leads to the largest improvement in segmentation performance relative to the baseline in both CT and MRI.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nLesion generating models are tools with significant potential for mitigating bias in medical vision AI algorithms concerning lesion detection, segmentation and quantification. Advancements in this topic should be highlighted in venues like this. \nThe manuscript is sufficiently well written, all the provided Figures/Tables are insightful and adequately formatted. \nThe choice of a 3D method for this inpainting problem is most adequate for CT and MRI. In these modalities, clinical lesion analysis workflows depend on the visualisation of multiple affected slices and 2D slice-wise inpainting methods would lead to slice-wise discontinuities. \n\nThe proposed method is sufficiently contextualised in the Introduction and Related work sections, where the reseach gap is clearly defined. Beyond that, this gap is empirically demonstrated by experimenting with state-of-the-art approaches (Cond-Diffusion variants and RePaint). \n\nThe proposed methodologies are thoroughly evaluated through comparisons with multiple other approaches, focusing on visual inspection of inpainted lesions (including comparison with real lesions) and their their downstream usability for training segmentation models. The latter evaluation used two different segmentation models, which contributes to the robustness of the findings across different segmentation training strategies. In addition, evaluating the approach on both MRI and CT datasets, ensures that the findings are not only applicable to one imaging domain. \n\nThis paper provides multiple key contributions which not only address the research gap but also deal with modality specific challenges related to lesion texture and shape heterogeneity. The corresponding claims are well supported by the results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nWhile S4, the Introduction and Background sections seem to imply that the proposed lesion focused loss is a novel contribution proposed for the first time by the authors. This might not be necessarily true considering that there have been other works that employ similar approaches [2, 3]. While few and perhaps not as thoroughly evaluated, mentioning them could further strengthen the contextualisation of the approach. \n\nThe description of the RePaint method in the experimental section implicitly suggests it consists of Cond-Diffusion using the RePaint [1] inference scheme. If that is the case it should be mentioned explicitly, if not then it should be better described. \nIn the segmentation experiments, it is understood that masks priors for generating lesions in healthy scans (N’) are either derived from real masks, handcrafted or generated by DiffMask. However, additional information should be provided on how exactly the conditioning histograms in this N’ setting are selected when using LeFusion-H variants. \n\nRegarding DiffMask, the definition and role of boundary mask is not very clear. From Figure 4, it is presumed that it corresponds to the bounding box defining the volume crop centred on the lesion. However, the statement “The boundary mask removes areas outside the boundary at each diffusion step” challenges this concept. Further clarity on this point would be appreciated. Furthermore, it is only implicit, that the DiffMask takes the CT/MRI volume crop as an input in addition to the conditioning control sphere. Section 3.3. should be updated to enhance clarity on all these aspects. \n\nAdding supplementary details on how the model training and checkpoint selection was conducted for the RePaint, Cond-Diffusion, Cond-Diffusion (L) would improve transparency. \n \n[Minor]\t \nMore detail on the dataset preprocessing would be beneficial for further reproducibility. A mention to the volume resolution is particularly lacking. \n\nThe choice of the specific crop-size could be further supported on previous work, for instance [4]. In addition, while not critical for acceptance, it would be interesting to study its effect over the results and would maybe answer the question: “How much local context is it necessary to generate realistic lesion?” \n\nWhile the purpose of the inpainted lesions is for downstream model training, further validating them using a radiologist would safeguard from potential biases that the generative model might be introducing the lesions. \n\nWhile describing Tables 1 and 2 it would be useful to clarify what is considered as “significant”. Since no standard deviations were provided, it is implied that these results were obtained for a single fold, so the concept of significance here is vague. In addition, while S5, the robustness of these findings to the specific data split could still be reinforced by adopting some sort of cross validation strategy. \nThe authors left unclear whether the segmentation model was trained on the volume crops centred on the lesion or on the entire scans. From using the Copy-Paste method in the evaluation, the latter is presumed but it is not explicitly mentioned. \n\nIn the cardiac MRI experiments, the LeFusion baseline of modelling the two lesion tissue types with separate models is mentioned as LeFusion in Table 2 but as LeFusion-S in Figure 5 and in the Appendix. It is suggested that the authors stick to one terminology. \nAs a work mainly focusing on specific diffusion model mechanics for improved lesion inpainting, it makes sense that the evaluation focus on comparing different diffusion based methods. That said, it would still be interesting to see how GAN based approaches like [4, 5] would fair in this comparison. \n \nReferences:  \n[1] Lugmayr, Andreas, et al. \"Repaint: Inpainting using denoising diffusion probabilistic models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2022. \n[2] Hansen, Colin, et al. \"Inpainting Pathology in Lumbar Spine MRI with Latent Diffusion.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.02477 (2024). \n[3] Rouzrokh, Pouria, et al. \"Multitask brain tumor inpainting with diffusion models: A methodological report.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.12113 (2022). \n[4] Yang, Jie, et al. \"Class-aware adversarial lung nodule synthesis in CT images.\" 2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019).

Its goal is to synthesize realistic lesions in lung CT and cardiac MRI scans for augmenting segmentation training data.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe authors introduce a latent diffusion model-based method for inserting lesions into healthy medical images while also providing an accompanying mask. They utilize a number of additions to their model to address limitations of prior work or naïve approaches to this task (both pre-existing and seemingly novel), such as combining forward-diffused backgrounds with reverse-diffused foregrounds, introducing intensity histogram-conditioning to the diffusion model to control lesion texture, as well as techniques for further control of the shape, size etc. of the generated lesion. They evaluate their method for a variety of experimental scenarios on 3D cardiac MRI lesion and CT lung nodule generation, showing that their technique results in noticeable improvements to existing approaches with respect to using their generated data to train downstream task segmentation models.\n\n### Soundness: 4\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nMajor\n1. The paper is polished, well-written and well-presented. Topics and concepts are organized and presented in a digestible fashion.\n2. Overall, decent technical novelty. This incorporates many techniques which all come together to result in a strongly-performing methods, some pre-existing (such as combined noised backgrounds with denoised foregrounds), and some seemingly novel (such as histogram-based textural control). Also, despite the many components, the approach still seems relatively watertight because these additions are all pretty lightweight/simple (a good thing). No requirement for an additional network or something of that sort.\n3. Overall, results are strong. Clear improvements over baseline methods is basically all cases, using reasonable metrics. They also study a range of training settings, which is good. Clear improvements over Cond-Diffusion, which would be the naïve approach that many would think of first trying for this task; the limitations of it as discussed in the introduction are clear from the experiments.\n4. They also have fairly extensive ablation studies for their method, which is important given the number of components that they propose using. There are still a few related questions that I have, but they are minor.\n5. In general, the evaluation is fair and appropriate. The datasets are challenging benchmarks, and I think two is sufficient given the wide range of experiments completed on them. There is also a good number of baseline models, especially considering that this task is relatively niche, so the methodological baselines that they compare to seem strong.\n\nMinor\n1. The motivation for this problem is clear: pathological subjects are indeed rare, especially for screening populations. Your survey of the limitations of existing lesion synthesis approaches also supports the motivation; for example, they result in low quality backgrounds, they lack precise control over generated lesions, etc.\n2. The use of a histogram representation to condition the model on may seem too reductive for some applications, but it seems to work well here (makes sense given the clear correspondence between histogram shape/number of peaks and generated lesion morphology shown in Fig. 3), supported by the clear improvement to your method that including the -H module produced.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nMajor\n1. Some limitations of impact/scope: This task is clinically important but still fairly niche in medical image analysis, which itself is fairly niche within general machine learning and computer vision. The method (and task itself) also requires that dataset used needs the required annotations, which many medical datasets may not possess, and can be expensive/time-consuming to acquire. Overall, these limit the impact of the work somewhat, in the context of an ML conference at the level of ICLR, compared to a venue a bit more niche like MICCAI.\n\nMinor\n1. The benefits from using multi-channel decomposition (comparing the \"-J\" to no \"-J\" variants of your model in Table 2) are quite small. Can you provide some analysis or discussion of why this is the case, even if just hypothesizing? (However, I am guessing that the computational requirement to adding this component is practically negligible, so there is not really any harm in including it even if it results in only a very small performance improvement.)\n2. You state in the abstract that synthesizing multi-peak and multi-class lesions is a \"major challenge\" I agree with the multi-peak case given how much your histogram-conditioning improved the generation of such lesions, but based on your channel decomposition module's only very small improvements to performance, I'm unsure if generating multi-class lesions could not already be done well by prior methods. Could you clarify this/point to your results that support this, and/or provide quantitative evidence that multi-class synthesis is challenging for prior approaches?\n\nTo summarize, the paper is methodologically solid, with some technical novelty, and demonstrates clear improvements to prior techniques for lesion generation tasks in medical images via well-designed experiments and baselines. However, the main limitation is just that the task is relatively niche within medical image ML, which makes it more niche within general ML, and so may be less impactful at a venue like ICLR as opposed to a medical imaging-focused venue such as MICCAI or MIDL. Still, these limitations do not take away the good things about the paper (of which there are many), so I vote for a marginal accept.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In the tables (e.g. table 1), what do you mean by the significantly adverse/positive effects denoted by red/blue? Could you please clarify this in the text as well via a small note in the table caption(s)?\n2. My suggestion: move image quality assessment quantitative results in the appendix (Table A2) to the main text if you have room. These are important metrics. You can shorten the related works to make space, that section doesn't need to be quite so extensive (or some of it could be moved to the supplementary).\n    - Also, why didn't you evaluate unpaired perceptual metrics like FID, KID (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01401), SWD (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) etc.? the first two may have limitations for this task given that they use pretrained natural image features, but despite this they are still commonly used metrics for generative medical image models. I would consider adding these for future work, and also explaining why they are not used (particularly for the wider ICLR audience).\n3. For the multiclass lesion case/-J model, did you study how performance/generation quality scales with adding more classes? This point may be a bit moot given how small the changes in performance were measured after adding the channel decomposition module to the base model, but I'm still curious.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 5",

The improvements are consistent and well quantified. Evaluation metrics are appropriate and justified.  \n3. **Impact and Scope:** While methodologically solid, the work’s overall reach is somewhat limited. The specific task—lesion insertion in medical images—is narrow within the broader ML domain, and the requirement for annotated datasets may constrain general applicability.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper focuses on generating lesion-containing images from healthy images to address challenges in downstream segmentation tasks, such as real-world data scarcity and long-tail distribution issues. Previous research on medical image synthesis has primarily concentrated on lesion generation design, often overlooking high-fidelity background preservation. The authors propose a lesion-focused diffusion model, LeFusion, which maintains high-fidelity background by integrating the background from forward diffusion into the reverse diffusion process, thus simplifying the learning process and improving output control. Additionally, two effective strategies are introduced: histogram-based texture control and multi-channel decomposition to address the two main challenges in lesion texture synthesis: 1) multimodal and 2) multiclass lesions. The paper is well-written, with comprehensive experimental comparisons.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The overall paper structure is clear and well-expressed.\n2. A novel diffusion model is redesigned from the perspective of high-fidelity background preservation, with two texture generation control techniques developed to address multimodal and multiclass issues.\n3. The comparative methods are recent benchmarks from the past two years, making the results highly convincing.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1.There is a lack of detail on implementation specifics (such as the sampling process) and theoretical support for the method.\n2. Analysis and discussion on the continuity at the fusion boundaries between lesion and background are missing, as well as the impact on downstream tasks.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. The reverse diffusion sampling process is not clearly defined; it appears to rely solely on the transformation in Equation (1), without detailing the sampling process or providing theoretical justification for omitting it.\n2. Although the background from forward diffusion is used as the background in the reverse sampling process, and the loss constraint is applied only to the lesion area, how is continuity and smoothness ensured in the intersecting regions between the lesion and background?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 5",

It presents a new generative modeling framework (LeFusion) for lesion synthesis in medical imaging, focusing on algorithmic innovation rather than pure application. By modifying diffusion model objectives to isolate lesion synthesis and maintain background fidelity, it contributes to the growing area of generative modeling for medical image augmentation, reconstruction, and fairness — all core interests of TMI.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe paper introduces several methodologically distinct components:\n- Reformulated diffusion process combining forward-diffused background and reverse-diffused lesion inference.\n- A lesion-focused training objective (mask-weighted diffusion loss).\n- Histogram-based texture control for multi-peak lesion synthesis.\n- Multi-channel decomposition for simultaneous multi-class lesion generation.\n- Lesion mask diffusion (DiffMask) for synthesizing controllable lesion masks.\n\nWhile the paper builds conceptually on existing diffusion and inpainting frameworks, its lesion-specific reformulation and multi-level control mechanisms appear novel and well-motivated. The scope is broader than an incremental application; it introduces a coherent set of algorithmic innovations intended to generalize across modalities.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe work demonstrates a high level of technical rigor:\n- Mathematical formulations are clearly defined.  \n- Both 3D CT and MRI validation are performed.  \n- Quantitative evaluation includes Dice, NSD, FID/KID/SWD, and PSNR/SSIM, with comparisons to multiple baselines.  \n- Downstream segmentation tasks strengthen the argument for clinical utility.  \nAreas that could be improved:\n  - Reproducibility would benefit from open, verified code links.  \n  - Statistical tests or confidence intervals on segmentation improvements would solidify claims.  \n  - The use of recurrent inference and control parameter selection could be explained theoretically.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nGenerally clear and logically organized, though the paper is dense. The figures (e.g., Fig. 1–4) are informative but could be simplified for readability. The writing style is occasionally verbose, and consistent terminology (“LeFusion-H/J/S”) could be better introduced. English usage is sound with minor grammatical issues.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \n✅ Ethical compliance is satisfactory. Only public datasets (LIDC, Emidec) are used; privacy and IRB concerns are addressed. The reproducibility statement is strong, promising open-source release with detailed documentation.\n\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe manuscript proposes *LeFusion*, a diffusion-based generative framework designed to synthesize realistic lesion-containing image–mask pairs from normal medical scans. Unlike standard conditional diffusion models that generate entire images, LeFusion focuses the diffusion process on lesion regions while reusing forward-diffused real backgrounds to ensure anatomical consistency. It introduces histogram-based texture control for multi-modal lesion textures, multi-channel decomposition for multiple lesion categories, and a lesion mask diffusion (DiffMask) mechanism enabling control over lesion size and location.  \nThe method is validated on lung CT (LIDC) and cardiac MRI (Emidec), showing improved segmentation performance over conventional synthesis approaches and other diffusion frameworks.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clearly defined methodological novelty beyond prior diffusion/inpainting work.  \n- Comprehensive experimental validation across modalities.  \n- Effective demonstration of downstream benefit with segmentation models (nnUNet, SwinUNETR).  \n- Conceptually elegant solution to background preservation using background-forward diffusion.  \n- Thoughtful design of control mechanisms (texture, mask, class).  \n- Open reproducibility plan and ethical transparency.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Though novel, the improvements in diffusion formulation remain largely empirical; limited theoretical justification for loss weighting and convergence behavior.  \n- No statistical significance analysis for segmentation improvements.  \n- Comparison limited to diffusion-based baselines; GAN-based or transformer-based generative models might offer complementary benchmarks.  \n- Some sections are repetitive or overly lengthy; a more concise presentation would aid readability.  \n- Qualitative examples mainly show improved realism but lack blinded reader studies.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Quantitative robustness** – Include confidence intervals or statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) on segmentation improvements to validate significance.  \n2. **Ablation justification** – While variants (H/J/S) are tested, a structured ablation isolating each design element (histogram control, mask diffusion, multi-channel) would strengthen claims.  \n3. **Theoretical grounding** – Provide deeper analysis of why lesion-focused learning improves convergence or fidelity. Discuss trade-offs in model capacity vs. region focus.  \n4. **Comparative scope** – Consider discussing performance relative to non-diffusion generative modalities (e.g., GAN or transformer generators) to clarify generalizability.  \n5. **Reproducibility link** – Ensure code and pretrained weights are fully accessible with exact experiment scripts before publication.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Minor typos: e.g., “b ackgrounds b y i ntegrating” (abstract).  \n- Figure 1 labeling could be simplified; arrows and sub-panels could be clearer.  \n- Define abbreviation “NSD” on first use.  \n- Clarify “control sphere” terminology; consider merging with “bounding sphere.”  \n- Reference formatting: remove redundant “inConference” artifacts.  \n- Some results tables (Tabs. 1–2) could use visual grouping or highlight improvements more clearly.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation:**  \n**Major Revision**  \nThe paper is well-aligned with *IEEE TMI* scope and shows strong potential for publishability. However, to reach TMI’s methodological and scientific rigor, the authors should better quantify improvement significance, streamline presentation, and add theoretical or statistical validation. With these enhancements, the paper would make a meaningful contribution to generative modeling for medical imaging.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 5 (High)\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nLeFusion offers clear methodological advances in lesion-focused diffusion modeling for medical image synthesis, presenting solid empirical evidence across modalities.

The method combines forward-diffused backgrounds with reverse-diffused foregrounds while training only on lesion regions (Figure 1). Key contributions include histogram-based texture control for multi-peak lesions, multi-channel decomposition for multi-class lesions, and lesion mask diffusion (DiffMask) for controlling size, location, and boundary. The approach is validated on lung nodule CT (LIDC dataset) and cardiac lesion MRI (Emidec dataset), demonstrating improvements in downstream segmentation performance with nnUNet and SwinUNETR models. Results show Dice score improvements of up to 5.18% for lung nodules and enhanced performance for cardiac lesions compared to baseline and competing methods (Tables 1-2).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and unclear notation**\n  - Equation (3) uses element-wise multiplication (⊙) but the dimensions of ot−1 and ˆxt−1 are not clearly established to ensure compatibility, particularly in the multi-channel case where dimensions expand to RD×H×W×n (Page 4-5)\n  - The relationship between β̄t and βt in Equation (2) is defined inconsistently - β̄t is defined as ∏ts=1(1−βs) but standard notation typically uses ᾱt for this cumulative product (Page 4)\n  - Equation (7-8) in Appendix C introduces parameters r, s, p, q without proper definition of their values or how they are determined, making the histogram control mechanism theoretically unclear (Page 16)\n\n• **Inadequate experimental validation and comparison methodology**\n  - The comparison with Cond-Diffusion (L) relies on \"fine-tuned open-source code\" rather than implementing the method under identical conditions, introducing potential implementation bias (Page 8, Section 4.1)\n  - Dataset splits are small with only 10 test cases for cardiac lesions (Emidec), limiting statistical significance of reported improvements (Page 7, Section 4.1)\n  - No statistical significance testing is provided for the reported performance improvements, despite claims of \"significant\" effects marked in blue/red in tables (Tables 1-2)\n  - The evaluation focuses primarily on segmentation downstream tasks but lacks direct assessment of lesion realism through clinical expert evaluation\n\n• **Technical approach limitations and unclear design choices**\n  - The lesion-focused loss in Equation (4) applies masking only during training but the paper doesn't adequately address how this affects the model's ability to generate coherent lesion-background transitions during inference (Page 5, Section 3.1)\n  - The histogram-based texture control method lacks theoretical justification for why histogram matching should preserve lesion authenticity, and the clustering into three groups (Figure 3) appears arbitrary without validation (Page 5, Figure 3)\n  - Multi-channel decomposition strategy doesn't explain how channel correlations are enforced beyond simple summation, potentially leading to unrealistic multi-class lesion combinations (Page 6, Equation 6)\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and standardize mathematical notation**\n  - Provide explicit dimensional analysis for all tensor operations, particularly showing how ot−1 ∈ RD×H×W×n and ˆxt−1 ∈ RD×H×W×n are compatible in Equation (3) for both single and multi-channel cases\n  - Use standard diffusion model notation (ᾱt instead of β̄t) and provide clear definitions of all variance schedule parameters with their typical ranges\n  - Include a complete mathematical derivation of the histogram control mechanism with explicit parameter definitions and their optimization procedure\n\n• **Strengthen experimental design and validation**\n  - Implement all comparison methods from scratch using identical training conditions, hyperparameters, and computational resources to ensure fair comparison\n  - Expand the cardiac lesion dataset or provide cross-validation results to increase statistical power, and include confidence intervals for all reported metrics\n  - Conduct statistical significance tests (t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) for all performance comparisons and remove subjective \"significant effect\" color coding without statistical backing\n  - Include clinical expert evaluation studies to assess lesion realism and diagnostic relevance of synthetic images\n\n• **Address technical gaps and provide better justification**\n  - Conduct ablation studies showing how the lesion-focused loss affects boundary quality and provide quantitative metrics for lesion-background transition coherence\n  - Validate the histogram clustering approach through medical domain knowledge, compare with established lesion classification schemes, and show that three clusters capture meaningful clinical distinctions\n  - Develop and evaluate explicit correlation modeling mechanisms for multi-channel decomposition, such as attention mechanisms or learned channel interaction layers, with quantitative assessment of multi-class lesion co-occurrence patterns",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents *LeFusion*, a lesion-focused diffusion framework designed to address data scarcity and class imbalance in medical imaging. The method combines forward-diffused background generation with reverse-diffused lesion foregrounds trained only on lesion regions. Key innovations include histogram-based texture control for multi-peak lesions, multi-channel decomposition for multi-class lesions, and diffusion-based lesion masks (DiffMask) for controllable lesion size, location, and boundary. Experiments on lung nodule CT data (LIDC) and cardiac lesion MRI data (Emidec) demonstrate improved segmentation performance using nnUNet and SwinUNETR backbones. While the idea is novel and potentially valuable for synthetic medical data generation, several critical issues in mathematical clarity, validation methodology, and theoretical justification limit the paper’s current strength.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Mathematical formulation and notation** – Several equations lack consistency or precise dimensional definition. Equation (3) applies element-wise multiplication, but tensor dimensions for \\(o_{t-1}\\) and \\(\\hat{x}_{t-1}\\) are not shown to be compatible, particularly in multi-channel cases. The relationship between \\(\\beta_t\\) and \\(\\bar{\\beta_t}\\) is defined inconsistently with standard diffusion notation. In Appendix C, parameters \\(r, s, p, q\\) are introduced without definition, obscuring the histogram control mechanism.  \n2. **Experimental design and comparison fairness** – Comparisons with Cond-Diffusion (L) rely on fine-tuned external code rather than a reimplementation under identical conditions, creating possible methodological bias. The Emidec dataset uses only ten test cases, and statistical significance tests are absent, undermining confidence in the reported “significant” improvements. Furthermore, experiments emphasize segmentation performance but omit clinical or perceptual evaluation of lesion realism.  \n3. **Technical and conceptual justification** – The lesion-focused loss applies masking only during training without confirming coherent lesion-background transitions at inference. The histogram-based texture control and three-cluster grouping lack theoretical or empirical validation. The multi-channel decomposition approach provides no mechanism for enforcing realistic inter-channel correlations.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify tensor dimensions throughout equations and adopt standard diffusion notation (use \\(\\bar{\\alpha_t}\\) instead of \\(\\bar{\\beta_t}\\)).  \n- Define all parameters in the histogram control mechanism with derivations or references.  \n- Specify dataset splits, performance metrics, and color-coding conventions in tables.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper offers an interesting contribution by integrating lesion-level controllability into diffusion-based medical image synthesis. However, its impact is limited by unclear mathematical exposition, insufficient experimental rigor, and unsubstantiated design choices. Providing complete mathematical definitions, ensuring reproducible and statistically valid comparisons, and strengthening the empirical and theoretical justification for each proposed module would substantially improve the work.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The paper shows promise but requires significant clarification and methodological improvements before it can be considered for acceptance.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces LeFusion, a lesion-focused diffusion model designed to generate lesion-containing image-segmentation pairs from lesion-free images. The authors aim to address the challenges of generating high-quality lesions with fine control over texture and location, while preserving high-fidelity backgrounds. LeFusion integrates forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process and introduces strategies for controlling lesion textures and masks.

The authors need to clarify how LeFusion's contributions are distinct from recent advancements in diffusion models for medical image synthesis.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily conducted on two datasets (LIDC and Emidec), with results showing improvements in segmentation performance. However, the scope of the evaluation could be broader to establish the generalizability of the method. Including additional datasets or anatomical regions would strengthen the claim of the method's broad applicability.\n\n3. Comparisons: While the authors compare LeFusion against several baselines, including hand-crafted methods and other diffusion-based approaches, the comparisons lack depth.

However, the manuscript should explicitly mention the availability of the code and data, and provide clear instructions for accessing and running the code.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity of Figures: Some figures, such as Figure 3, could be more readable with fewer representative slices and zoomed-in regions to highlight key differences.\n2. Consistency in Terminology: The notation and terminology used in the paper, particularly in Section 2.1, should be consistent and clearly explained.\n3.

        "text": "## LeFusion: Controllable Pathology Synthesis VIA Lesion-Focused Diffusion Models\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes LeFusion, a lesion-focused diffusion framework for controllable pathology synthesis that preserves background anatomy while generating lesion appearance only within specified masks. The core idea is to fuse forward-diffused real background with reverse-diffused lesion predictions and to train with a mask-weighted loss that concentrates learning on lesion regions. The authors further introduce two control mechanisms—histogram-based texture conditioning for multi-peak lesions (e.g., lung nodules) and multi-channel decomposition for multi-class lesions (e.g., MI and PMO in cardiac MRI)—and a diffusion-based mask generator (DiffMask) that controls lesion size, location, and boundaries. On 3D CT (LIDC) and MRI (EMIDEC), synthesized data from LeFusion improves downstream segmentation over several baselines.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe lesion-focused loss combined with inpainting-style background fusion is a clean and principled way to preserve background while dedicating capacity to lesion appearance; this is a pragmatic, scalable design for medical contexts.Histogram-based texture conditioning is a simple, annotation-free mechanism to control multi-peak intensity distributions (e.g., solid vs. ground-glass nodules) and is particularly suitable when only image–mask pairs are available.Multi-channel decomposition for joint multi-class lesion generation is a sensible extension that captures inter-class correlations without entangling backgrounds.DiffMask introduces a structured mask diffusion approach with boundary masks and control spheres for size/location control, which is more flexible than morphology-only heuristics.\n- Experimental rigor and validationEvaluation on two 3D datasets (LIDC for CT, EMIDEC for MRI) with two strong downstream baselines (nnU-Net and SwinUNETR) demonstrates consistent segmentation gains.Comparisons include multiple reasonable baselines: hand-crafted textures, conditional diffusion (image and latent), RePaint, and copy-paste; results differentiate contributions clearly and show LeFusion variants outperform prior approaches.Ablations across LeFusion vs. LeFusion-H (histogram control) and LeFusion-J (multi-class joint modeling) are informative and consistent with the stated goals.\n- Clarity of presentationThe central idea (forward-diffused background + reverse-diffused lesion with a lesion-focused objective) is clearly stated and mathematically grounded with concise equations.Problem framing around background preservation, controllability (texture, size, location), and multi-peak/multi-class settings is well-motivated and illustrated.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses core bottlenecks in clinically relevant synthetic augmentation: maintaining anatomical plausibility, aligning image–mask pairs, and enabling controllability without extensive additional labels.The proposed approach yields substantial downstream segmentation improvements (notably >4–5 Dice points in several regimes), which is practically valuable for long-tailed, low-prevalence pathologies.\n\n- The lesion-focused loss combined with inpainting-style background fusion is a clean and principled way to preserve background while dedicating capacity to lesion appearance;

while the integration is well-executed, the conceptual novelty is moderate and would benefit from tighter theoretical analysis (e.g., guarantees on boundary consistency and leakage).Histogram conditioning captures only low-level intensity statistics; structure- or texture-level controls (heterogeneity, spiculation, rim enhancement) are not explicitly modeled, which may limit realism in complex phenotypes.DiffMask’s shape generative process and constraints are only qualitatively evaluated; potential over-regularization from boundary masks and smoothing may bias shape statistics.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesNo statistical significance tests or confidence intervals are reported; EMIDEC test set (n=10 pathological) is small and likely high-variance.Lack of radiologist or expert reader studies; reliance on downstream segmentation and limited unpaired metrics constrains assessment of clinical realism and subtle artifacts.More detailed ablations are needed to isolate the contribution of the lesion-focused objective versus inpainting-style background fusion (e.g., global loss vs. mask-weighted loss using the same sampler).Limited generalization assessment: only two datasets; no out-of-domain tests or robustness to imperfect masks (e.g., using predicted masks).\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSome implementation specifics are missing: network architecture details, diffusion parameterization (epsilon/x0/v-pred), sampling schedule/NFE, compute budget, and training time; these are critical for 3D diffusion reproducibility.The precise pipeline for histogram conditioning (number of bins, normalization, embedding mechanism for cross-attention, selection/definition of histograms at inference) is underspecified.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsThere is limited engagement with recent lesion- or anatomy-focused diffusion frameworks that are closely related in spirit: e.g., Lung-DDPM/Lung-DDPM+ (anatomically aware blending and mask conditioning), LAND (latent 3D CT with mask conditioning), and region-focused fine-tuning methods like MedDiff-FT; as well as clinically guided multi-stage pipelines (e.g., LesionDiffusion) and cardiac lesion-focused work (e.g., CLAIM).A direct comparison to mask-weighted conditional finetuning approaches or latent 3D models operating at higher resolution could help clarify trade-offs in fidelity vs. compute.\n\n- The lesion-focused training objective is closely related to mask-weighted losses and diffusion inpainting;

however, boundary transition quality depends on how M_f is defined/smoothed. It would help to clarify whether soft masks or boundary ramps are used to mitigate seams.The lesion-focused loss E[M_f ||ε − pθ(xt, t)||^2] is a reasonable specialization; discussing the effect on gradient magnitudes, potential bias near mask borders, and whether a small weight is used outside M_f to stabilize global context would improve rigor.Multi-channel decomposition is a straightforward extension; detailing how channels interact (shared encoder/decoder with channel-wise outputs, shared attention blocks) and whether cross-channel attention or explicit consistency constraints are used would clarify how inter-class correlations are captured.DiffMask: the boundary mask and control sphere are intuitive; please formalize the boundary mask construction and training loss, specify whether signed distance fields or dilations are used, and describe how multi-channel masks are regularized to avoid overlaps or impossible configurations.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentThe segmentation gains are substantial and consistent across nnU-Net and SwinUNETR, which strengthens the case for utility.

A discussion of clinically constrained vs. data-driven mask generation (trade-offs in realism, control granularity, and downstream outcomes) would benefit readers.LesionDiffusion employs text-guided control for mask geometry and appearance; contrasting histogram-intensity control with higher-level semantic attribute control would clarify the scope of controllability in LeFusion.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe framework directly addresses real bottlenecks in medical imaging AI—data scarcity, long-tailed distributions, and the need for controllable augmentation that respects anatomy. If reproducibility is ensured (code/models), the community can use it as a practical tool.Risks include misuse for fraudulent image tampering and the potential for subtle, systematic artifacts that could bias downstream models; adding safeguards (watermarking, provenance metadata) and transparent QA would be responsible next steps.Future directions could include richer controllability (e.g., radiologist-attribute conditioning beyond histograms), uncertainty-aware sampling for diverse lesion styles, and multi-centre validation to assess robustness.\n\n- The inpainting-style fusion x_{t-1} = M_f ⊙ o_{t-1} + M_b ⊙ x̂_{t-1} is sound and enforces background preservation outside M_f at each step; however, boundary transition quality depends on how M_f is defined/smoothed.

Can you quantify target-vs-generated histogram alignment within lesion regions?\n- Can you report statistical significance (e.g., paired t-tests or bootstrap CIs) for Dice/NSD improvements, especially on EMIDEC test (n=10 pathological), and provide per-fold variance if cross-validation was considered?\n- Please include an ablation isolating the effects of (a) lesion-focused loss vs global loss, and (b) inpainting-style background fusion vs conditional diffusion, with all else equal.\n- How robust is LeFusion to imperfect masks at training or inference (e.g., using automatically predicted or dilated/eroded masks)? Does boundary quality degrade, and does DiffMask help mitigate misalignment?\n- For DiffMask, can you provide quantitative shape-distribution comparisons (e.g., sphericity, elongation, compactness histograms, MMD over shape features) against real masks and hand-crafted masks?\n- How does LeFusion perform out-of-domain (different scanners, protocols, centers)? Have you tested on external datasets for either CT nodules or cardiac scars/PMO?\n- Did you explore combining histogram control with higher-level semantic control (e.g., textual attributes or radiologist labels) to move beyond intensity statistics for complex textures?\n- For multi-class cardiac lesions, how are interactions between MI and PMO controlled (e.g., mutual exclusivity, adjacency)? Is there any explicit constraint to avoid anatomically implausible overlaps?\n- Can you comment on the trade-off between compute cost and sample quality/diversity (e.g., NFEs vs Dice gains), and whether fast samplers (DPM-Solver++) materially affect background seams or lesion texture fidelity?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper presents a practical and well-motivated approach for controllable medical image synthesis that preserves background anatomy by focusing diffusion learning on lesion regions and fusing forward-diffused background. The integration of histogram-based texture control, multi-channel joint modeling, and a diffusion-based mask generator addresses key pain points in medical augmentation—background fidelity, controllability, and diversity—while delivering meaningful segmentation gains on two 3D datasets. The methodological core is incremental relative to existing inpainting and mask-weighted diffusion ideas, but the adaptation and thorough application to lesion-centric 3D synthesis are valuable and executed carefully. To strengthen the case for a top-tier venue, the paper would benefit from more comprehensive ablations, stronger statistical analysis, and deeper engagement with closely related recent works (particularly anatomy-aware 3D diffusion and region-focused finetuning). Adding quantitative mask-shape evaluations, histogram-alignment metrics, robustness to imperfect masks, and possibly a small reader study would further elevate the contribution. Overall, LeFusion is a solid, impactful piece of applied generative methodology with clear utility for the community; with the suggested clarifications and analyses, it would be competitive for publication.",

The approach fuses a forward-diffused real background with a reverse-diffused lesion prediction and trains via a mask-weighted loss emphasizing lesion regions. Additional features include histogram-based texture conditioning for multi-peak lesions, multi-channel decomposition for multi-class generation, and a diffusion-based mask generator (DiffMask) for size, location, and boundary control. Evaluations on CT (LIDC) and cardiac MRI (EMIDEC) datasets demonstrate improvements in downstream segmentation performance over multiple baselines. Overall, the paper is clearly presented, technically sound, and addresses a relevant problem in medical data augmentation.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Technical novelty and analysis:** While well executed, the integration of lesion-focused training with inpainting-style fusion is conceptually close to existing mask-weighted diffusion or inpainting approaches; more theoretical analysis could strengthen claims of novelty and boundary consistency.  \n2. **Methodological limitations:** Histogram conditioning captures low-level intensity statistics but not higher-level structural textures, limiting realism for complex lesion phenotypes. The DiffMask module is qualitatively assessed, and possible over-regularization in shape generation is not quantified.  \n3. **Experimental design:** Statistical significance tests or confidence intervals are absent, and the EMIDEC test set is small, limiting reliability. No expert reader evaluation is provided, and ablations isolating loss and fusion components are incomplete. Generalization is limited to two datasets without out-of-domain testing.  \n4. **Reproducibility and clarity:** Essential implementation details—network architecture, diffusion parameterization, sampling schedule, compute budget, and training time—are missing. The histogram conditioning and DiffMask construction pipelines need clearer specification.  \n5. **Related work engagement:** The paper omits discussion or comparison with closely related frameworks (e.g., Lung-DDPM, LAND, MedDiff-FT, CLAIM, LesionDiffusion). Including these would better position the contribution and clarify advantages over recent anatomy-aware diffusion models.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify mask definitions and smoothing at lesion boundaries.  \n- Add quantitative evaluations of histogram fidelity and mask-shape realism (e.g., sphericity, compactness).  \n- Report compute details (volume size, UNet depth, sampler type, NFEs, GPU).  \n- Provide results of ablations separating lesion-focused loss and background fusion effects.  \n- Consider a small reader or visual Turing study to assess clinical realism.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nLeFusion presents a pragmatic and technically sound diffusion-based framework for anatomically consistent lesion synthesis with controllable attributes.

Nonetheless, improvements in statistical rigor, architectural transparency, and comparative analysis with recent models would enhance both scientific and practical credibility. Expanding ablations, reporting quantitative evaluations for control mechanisms, and validating robustness to imperfect masks would strengthen the manuscript.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The paper is promising and methodologically solid but requires additional empirical analysis, clarity in implementation details, and a more thorough comparison with related diffusion-based medical synthesis methods before acceptance.",

Summary of the Paper\n\nThe paper addresses the critical problem of data scarcity and long-tail imbalances in medical imaging datasets, which often leads to biased outcomes and algorithmic unfairness in AI-based medical analysis. The authors propose LeFusion, a novel lesion-focused diffusion model that synthesizes pathological images by concentrating diffusion learning objectives exclusively on lesion areas while preserving high-fidelity backgrounds through integration of forward-diffused background contexts. The method introduces three key innovations: histogram-based texture control for multi-peak lesions (e.g., lung nodules with distinct texture types), multi-channel decomposition for multi-class lesions (e.g., different cardiac lesions), and lesion mask diffusion for controlling lesion size, location, and boundary. Validated on 3D cardiac lesion MRI and lung nodule CT datasets, LeFusion demonstrates substantial improvements in downstream segmentation tasks, with generated data boosting performance of state-of-the-art models (nnUNet and SwinUNETR) by up to 5.18% in Dice score and 4.4% in normalized surface distance compared to baseline. The paper effectively demonstrates that synthetic data generated from normal scans using this approach can significantly enhance the performance of segmentation models for rare pathological conditions.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The lesion-focused approach is conceptually sound and directly addresses a fundamental limitation in current medical image synthesis methods—preservation of high-fidelity anatomical backgrounds—which is particularly important in clinical applications where background integrity is crucial.\n- The histogram-based texture control is an elegant solution to the multi-peak lesion problem that requires no additional annotations beyond standard image-mask pairs, making it highly practical for real-world implementation.\n- The multi-channel decomposition strategy for multi-class lesions is well-motivated and effectively captures correlations between different lesion types, as demonstrated in the cardiac lesion experiments.\n- The experimental design is comprehensive, with multiple comparison methods, two different medical imaging modalities, and thorough evaluation metrics including both image quality assessment and downstream segmentation performance.\n- The results are impressive and clinically relevant, showing consistent improvements in segmentation performance across different experimental settings, with gains as high as 5.18% in Dice score.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper does not provide a clear analysis of the computational cost and inference time requirements of LeFusion compared to baseline methods, which is critical for potential clinical implementation where efficiency matters.\n- There is limited discussion about failure cases or limitations of the approach—specifically, what types of lesions or imaging scenarios might not be well-synthesized by the method.\n- While the ethics statement mentions potential misuse, there is no deeper discussion of the ethical implications of synthetic medical image generation, particularly regarding how to ensure generated data doesn't introduce new biases or how to verify synthetic data quality before clinical use.\n- The paper demonstrates effectiveness on two datasets but lacks discussion about generalizability to other medical imaging domains (e.g., neurological disorders, abdominal imaging) or other types of lesions not covered in the current evaluation.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- Some figures (particularly Figure 5 and Figure 6) could be improved with clearer labeling and better visual contrast to make the differences between methods more apparent to readers.\n- A more detailed ablation study showing the individual contribution of each component (histogram control, multi-channel decomposition, lesion mask diffusion) would strengthen the paper's claims about the importance of each innovation.\n- Certain technical details about the diffusion model architecture and training procedure could be expanded for better reproducibility (e.g., specific U-Net architecture details, number of parameters).\n- There are a few instances of unclear phrasing (e.g., the description of the recurrent mechanism in Section F) that could be improved for better readability.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Against TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a critical challenge in medical AI—data scarcity for rare pathological conditions—which directly impacts the development and deployment of reliable diagnostic tools. The solution has significant potential to improve the performance of medical image analysis models across various clinical applications where pathological data is limited. The demonstrated improvements in segmentation performance for both lung nodules and cardiac lesions highlight the broad applicability of the approach.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper presents several novel contributions that advance the field beyond standard conditional diffusion models. The lesion-focused diffusion approach that preserves background integrity by design is conceptually innovative. The histogram-based texture control for multi-peak lesions and multi-channel decomposition for multi-class lesions address specific challenges in medical image synthesis that existing methods don't adequately handle. These innovations represent a meaningful advancement in controllable medical image synthesis.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is comprehensive and well-designed, with multiple comparison methods, two different medical imaging modalities, and thorough metrics. The inclusion of both quantitative metrics (Dice, NSD, PSNR, SSIM) and qualitative visual comparisons strengthens the evaluation. The downstream segmentation tasks provide clinically relevant validation of the synthetic data quality. However, a more detailed ablation study of the individual components would further strengthen the evaluation by clearly establishing the contribution of each innovation.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides a good level of detail about the methodology and experimental setup. The authors commit to releasing code and pre-processed data, which is essential for reproducibility. The implementation details section (Appendix F) provides sufficient information about model architectures, training parameters, and evaluation procedures. However, some additional details about the specific diffusion model architectures and the exact configuration of comparison methods would enhance reproducibility for researchers looking to build upon this work.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision**\n\nThe paper presents a significant and innovative approach to a critical problem in medical imaging with compelling experimental results. The methodological contributions are valuable, and the evaluation is generally strong. However, the paper requires revisions to address the computational efficiency concerns, expand on the limitations and failure cases, provide a more detailed ablation study, and improve the discussion of broader implications and generalizability. The authors should also address the minor issues regarding figure clarity and technical details. With these revisions, the paper would be a strong contribution to the field and suitable for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. The requested revisions are substantial enough to warrant a major revision decision, as they would significantly improve the paper's completeness and impact.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the persistent problems of data scarcity and long‑tail class imbalance in medical imaging by synthesizing lesion‑containing image‑segmentation pairs from scans that originally lack lesions. The authors evaluate their approach on two publicly available datasets: 3‑D lung nodule CT (LIDC) and cardiac lesion MRI (Emidec). In each case, normal and pathological cases are partitioned into separate training and testing sets. The core of the method is a lesion‑focused diffusion model, named **LeFusion**, which confines the diffusion loss to the lesion region, merges forward‑diffused background information with reverse‑diffused foreground content, and adds a histogram‑based texture controller to handle multi‑peak lesions together with a multi‑channel decomposition scheme for multi‑class lesions. An auxiliary module, **DiffMask**, diffuses lesion masks so that size, location, and boundary can be manipulated in a controllable way. Down‑stream segmentation experiments using nnUNet and SwinUNETR demonstrate modest Dice‑score improvements on both datasets. The principal contribution is a diffusion‑based pipeline that creates high‑fidelity synthetic lesions while preserving the realism of the surrounding anatomy.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:** The challenges of limited annotated data and skewed class distributions are well‑known in medical imaging. A technique that can reliably generate diverse, lesion‑rich training samples while maintaining realistic background anatomy could be highly valuable for clinical applications.  \n- **Innovation:** The introduction of a lesion‑focused loss and the reuse of forward‑diffused background context represent a thoughtful adaptation of diffusion‑inpainting to medical imaging. The histogram‑based texture control and the multi‑channel lesion generation are original ideas, even though similar conditioning strategies have recently appeared in the diffusion literature.  \n- **Evaluation:** The authors report gains in Dice and NSD on two datasets and supplement the analysis with perceptual metrics such as FID, KID, and SWD. Nevertheless, the manuscript lacks statistical testing and a comprehensive ablation that isolates each component (lesion‑focused loss, histogram control, multi‑channel handling, DiffMask). Moreover, there is no external validation on an additional dataset or cross‑modality experiments that would strengthen the generality of the approach.  \n- **Reproducibility:** While a code repository is mentioned and hardware/training details (6 × A100 GPUs, learning rate 1e‑4, batch size 16, 300 timesteps) are provided, several crucial implementation specifics are missing. Details such as the exact noise schedule, depth of the U‑Net backbone, hyper‑parameters governing histogram conditioning, random seeds, and the precise protocol used to split the datasets are not disclosed, which hampers exact replication.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n- **Loss formulation clarity:** Equation (4) incorporates a mask **M_f**, yet the manuscript does not explain how **M_f** is obtained for normal images (i.e., how synthetic masks are generated) in Section 3.1.  \n- **Histogram conditioning details:** Equation (5) refers to conditioning on a histogram **h**, but the dimensionality of **h**, the preprocessing steps applied to it, and the way it is fed into the cross‑attention module (see Figures 3 and 6) are omitted.  \n- **Ablation of DiffMask:** Table 1 contrasts “LeFusion” with “LeFusion‑H” but does not isolate the contribution of the DiffMask module. An ablation study that directly compares performance with and without DiffMask would clarify its impact (see Figure 4).  \n- **Statistical analysis:** The reported Dice improvements (e.g., +2.3 % for LeFusion‑H) are presented without confidence intervals or p‑values, leaving it unclear whether the gains are statistically significant (Tables 1 and 2).  \n- **Dataset split reproducibility:** The manuscript specifies the number of training and test cases (e.g., 808/202 for LIDC) but does not disclose the random seed, stratification method, or whether the split is performed on a patient‑wise basis (Section 4.1).  \n- **Baseline coverage:** Recent diffusion‑based lesion synthesis works, such as Chen et al. 2024 and Lai et al. 2024, receive only a brief mention. Including direct quantitative comparisons on the same data splits would provide a more rigorous evaluation (Related Work).  \n- **Hyper‑parameter justification:** The control‑level ratio (75 : 20 : 5) and the ±10 % histogram fluctuation described in Section F are introduced without any sensitivity analysis or justification for these choices.  \n- **Inference speed comparison:** Generation time is reported as 30–50 seconds per sample, yet no benchmark against competing methods is presented, making it difficult to assess practical efficiency.  \n- **Mask diversity limitations:** DiffMask relies on a “control sphere” derived from real masks; the manuscript does not quantify how this constraint might limit the diversity of generated mask shapes.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\nThe current submission lacks essential baseline comparisons and statistical validation, which leaves the main claims insufficiently supported.",

However, transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks, such as lesion segmentation in 3D CT scans, remains a critical challenge. Due to the complexity and variability of pathological visual characteristics, existing methods struggle to align fine-grained lesion features not encountered during training with disease-related textual representations. In this paper, we present Malenia, a novel multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment framework, specifically designed for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation. Malenia improves the compatibility between mask representations and their associated elemental attributes, explicitly linking the visual features of unseen lesions with the extensible knowledge learned from previously seen ones. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to enhance both visual and textual features with mutually beneficial information, effectively guiding the generation of segmentation results. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets and 12 lesion categories validate the superior performance of Malenia.",

Building on advancements in medical vision-language pre-training, Malenia integrates a multi-scale mask-attribute alignment framework and a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to link visual and textual features, enabling the model to handle previously unseen lesions. The authors evaluate Malenia's performance through experiments on three datasets (two public and one private) across 12 lesion categories.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The topic on zero-shot lesion segmentation is valuable, as clinical settings often involve diverse, emerging anomalies, and data collection is challenging, increasing the need for models that handle unseen diseases in an open-set context.\n2. The authors strengthen their claims with both qualitative and quantitative results, enhancing the credibility of their findings and providing a well-rounded evaluation of the proposed approach.\n3. The paper is well-organized, with a clear and logical structure that makes complex concepts accessible and easy to follow for readers.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The Zero-Shot Inference section lacks sufficient detail on how the model handles test CT images containing unseen tumor types. For instance, if a test image includes both a kidney tumor and a gallbladder tumor, it is unclear how the model predicts these different tumors within the same image. Additionally, the phrase “we obtain the class information for each predicted lesion mask by referencing a clinical knowledge table” is ambiguous. Further clarification is needed on what this clinical knowledge table entails and how it is used in the inference process.\n2. The comparisons in Table 1 and Table 2 may not be entirely fair. The authors introduce additional ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS annotations, which provide extra information not available to baseline methods like TransUNet, nnUNet, and Swin UNETR. These baselines rely solely on image data, while the proposed approach leverages attribute annotations, giving it an advantage in performance comparisons.\n3. The fully-supervised performance of baseline methods reported in Table 2 appears unusually low. For instance, in the official nnUNet paper, liver tumor segmentation achieved a Dice score of 76 on the test set, whereas the presented result here is only 61.33. Similarly, lung tumor segmentation originally reported a Dice score of 74, but this paper reports 54.44. This discrepancy raises concerns about the reproducibility and fairness of the comparisons.\n4. In Table 7, the authors compare their method to existing vision-language pretraining strategies, but it is unclear how these methods were reproduced. Most vision-language pretraining approaches require access to diagnostic reports, which are not included in the public MSD and KiTS23 datasets. It would be helpful to understand how the authors conducted these comparisons without complete diagnostic reports. Additionally, the absence of comparisons with important pretraining models like CT-CLIP weakens the evaluation.\n5. Scalability of the proposed method is questionable due to its reliance on ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS. For practical clinical applications, this approach would require physicians to provide additional lesion descriptions across eight visual attribute aspects, which may not be feasible in all settings. This dependency could limit the method’s applicability in diverse clinical environments.\n\n### Questions\n\nplease refer to Weaknesses\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- Yes, Privacy, security and safety\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 5\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nThis paper utilizes private clinical data, which may require an ethics review to ensure compliance with privacy, security, and safety standards.",

The authors aim to address the challenges of transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks—such as lesion segmentation—by proposing a multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment approach. Malenia improves the alignment between the visual features of unseen lesions with textual representations, leveraging Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI) to enhance both visual and textual embeddings. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate that Malenia outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in zero-shot lesion segmentation.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed Malenia framework is novel, particularly in its use of multi-scale mask-attribute alignment for 3D lesion segmentation. This is a meaningful extension of zero-shot segmentation methods to the medical domain, where unseen lesion categories are common (e.g., \"hepatocellular carcinoma,\" mentioned in Sec. 1).\n2. The CMKI module is a strong contribution because it combines visual and textual embeddings, enriching the segmentation prediction with complementary information from both modalities. This is a novel approach that enhances the zero-shot capability of the model.\n3. The paper introduces a multi-positive contrastive loss to fine-tune the alignment between lesion masks and textual attributes. This approach allows the model to generalize better to unseen lesions by learning from shared visual attributes, which distinguishes it from prior works like SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The method relies on transforming patient reports into structured descriptions of eight visual attributes, which requires expert radiologist involvement. This process may not be scalable or practical in real-world applications where such annotations are not readily available.\n2. As noted in Appendix D, the model performs less effectively on attributes requiring complex visual semantic understanding, such as \"Surface Characteristics\" and \"Specific Features\". This suggests a potential limitation in capturing intricate visual patterns.\n3. While the model shows strong performance on 12 lesion categories, the diversity of lesions in clinical practice is vast. The ability of Malenia to generalize to a wider range of unseen lesions without additional training remains uncertain.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In Section 3.1, the authors employ the Multi-Positive InfoNCE (MP-NCE) loss for aligning mask embeddings with multiple attribute embeddings. Could the authors provide more details on how the MP-NCE loss is computed and how it facilitates learning with multiple positive pairs? Specifically, how are the positive and negative pairs defined in the context of multiple attributes?\n   Could the authors explain how this formulation effectively handles multiple positive pairs for each mask token?\n2. The model uses a fixed number of mask tokens ($N=16$) and defines $R=8$ attribute aspects. Have the authors conducted any experiments to assess how varying $N$ or the number of attributes affects the model's performance? An ablation study on these hyperparameters could provide insights into the model's sensitivity and optimal settings.\n3. As noted in Appendix D, the model performs less well on attributes like \"Surface Characteristics\" and \"Specific Features\". What are the potential reasons for this lower performance? Could incorporating additional contextual information or advanced features help the model better capture complex visual semantics?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

This indicates possible difficulty in modeling fine-grained or high-level visual patterns.  \n3. **Generalization scope** – While evaluation covers 12 lesion categories, the diversity of lesions in clinical practice is much larger. The capacity of the model to generalize to completely unseen lesion types without retraining remains uncertain.  \n4. **Loss formulation clarity** – Clarification is requested regarding the Multi-Positive InfoNCE (MP-NCE) loss (Section 3.1): specifically, how multiple positive pairs are defined and how positive/negative relationships are established for mask tokens.  \n5. **Hyperparameter sensitivity** – The model uses a fixed number of mask tokens (N = 16) and eight attribute aspects (R = 8). Experiments varying these parameters would strengthen the paper by revealing sensitivity and optimal settings.  \n6. **Improving complex attribute modeling** – Given the noted difficulty with certain attributes, the authors could discuss whether incorporating richer contextual cues or advanced visual features could mitigate this limitation.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- None reported beyond those embedded in major comments; the manuscript’s presentation appears clear and well structured.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper offers a novel and well-motivated framework extending zero-shot segmentation techniques to medical imaging through cross-modal feature alignment. Strengths include methodological innovation (especially CMKI and multi-positive contrastive loss) and solid empirical performance. Main concerns involve the scalability of radiologist-produced attribute annotations, incomplete handling of complex visual semantics, and limited exploration of hyperparameter and generalization behavior.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Recommendation: Major Revision** — The contribution is innovative and promising, but clarification of methodological details and additional analysis are needed to address practical and performance limitations.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces a zero-shot medical image semantic segmentation framework built upon a MaskFormer backbone and an attribute-based visual–language feature fusion strategy. To establish fine-grained alignment between visual features and textual concepts, the approach decomposes radiological reports into structured lesion-level attributes with assistance from large language models (LLMs) and human annotators. This method aims to improve generalization to unseen lesion categories. Evaluation on tumor segmentation tasks demonstrates enhanced segmentation performance compared with existing zero-shot methods. Overall, the paper is clearly written, describes its components in detail, and presents extensive ablation studies supporting the design choices.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and Contribution** – While the framework achieves improved segmentation results, its structure closely resembles ZePT (Jiang et al., 2024), which also uses a MaskFormer backbone and combined visual–textual features derived from lesion descriptions. The principal innovation may thus be limited to the explicit decomposition of free-text reports into organized attribute categories. The authors should clarify whether this explicit attribute-based formulation constitutes the core technical novelty and discuss its conceptual advantage over prior designs.  \n2. **Practical Feasibility** – The use of GPT‑4 for attribute extraction raises concerns regarding data privacy and legal restrictions in medical contexts. The authors are encouraged to discuss whether comparable results could be obtained using locally deployable open-source LLMs, and to what extent human annotation remains necessary for reliable attribute extraction.  \n3. **Clarity of Presentation** – Figure 1 aggregates multiple technical details, which may reduce readability. The authors might consider separating some components into distinct figures and aligning them with the relevant explanatory text.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Ensure that figure placement corresponds to text flow for greater clarity.  \n- Edit minor typographical and formatting inconsistencies as needed.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis study applies an attribute-based decomposition of radiological reports to improve zero-shot lesion segmentation by achieving finer alignment between text and image modalities. The method is technically sound, clearly described, and empirically validated through thorough ablations. The main issues concern the clarity of the claimed novelty relative to prior work and the practicality of relying on closed LLMs for attribute generation. Addressing these points would strengthen the paper’s contribution and applicability.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript presents a new methodological framework — *Malenia* — for **3D zero‑shot lesion segmentation**, combining cross‑modal representation learning, multi‑scale alignment, and a novel cross‑modal fusion (CMKI) mechanism. The contribution squarely targets core topics of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*: imaging informatics, segmentation methodology, and cross‑modal learning in radiology.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe paper claims two central technical novelties:  \n- **Multi‑scale mask‑attribute alignment** bridging global image–text pre‑training and dense voxel‑level prediction.  \n- **Cross‑Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI)** to jointly update mask and text embeddings.  \nWhile the work builds on existing transformer backbones (Mask2Former) and CLIP‑style pre‑training concepts, the formulation of *multi‑positive contrastive alignment using structured radiology attributes* is original and represents a meaningful extension beyond prior ZePT or SAM‑based pipelines. Novelty is moderate‑to‑high for TMI, assuming reproducibility and dataset access are adequate.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nExperiments are comprehensive: three datasets (MSD, KiTS23, and a private cohort, totaling 12 lesion types) and extensive ablations, including attribute construction, CMKI design, hyper‑parameter studies, and comparisons to multiple baselines. The methodology is mathematically consistent. However:  \n- The reproducibility of the *semi‑automatic attribute extraction* pipeline using GPT‑4 plus radiologist correction could be better documented (e.g., inter‑rater agreement, automation error rate).  \n- Public availability of the processed attribute annotations is only promised, not confirmed.  \n- Assertions regarding clinical interpretability and “diagnostic precision” might be slightly overstated without expert reader studies.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nOverall well organized, technically clear, and grammatically sound. Figures are dense but informative; minor language editing would improve readability (inconsistent capitalization and spacing, e.g., “Z ERO -SHOT,” “P ancreas”). The manuscript length is high but proportional to complexity.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nEthics statements for the private dataset are provided; anonymization appears sound. Code release is stated publicly on GitHub but anonymized for review. For TMI, explicit confirmation that IRB approval and data‑sharing guidelines will be satisfied is necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \nThe authors propose *Malenia*, a **vision‑language pre‑training framework** enabling zero‑shot 3D lesion segmentation. The approach integrates structured radiology attributes (e.g., shape, density, enhancement status) into a **multi‑scale mask‑attribute alignment** loss and introduces a **Cross‑Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI)** module that fuses fine‑grained visual and textual embeddings to improve segmentation of both seen and unseen diseases. Evaluation on multiple public and private CT datasets demonstrates superior Dice and NSD scores compared with SAM‑based and prior vision‑language segmentation models.\n\n2. **Strengths**\n- Addresses an important and underexplored problem: zero‑shot lesion segmentation in 3D medical imaging.  \n- Methodologically innovative: multi‑positive contrastive learning using structured attribute tokens, and bi‑directional feature fusion.  \n- Extensive quantitative and qualitative validation, including ablations and fine‑tuning analyses.  \n- Strong empirical improvement over state‑of‑the‑art baselines.  \n- Clear ethical protocol and commitment to releasing attribute annotations.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**\n- The reliance on proprietary LLMs (GPT‑4) for attribute extraction limits reproducibility; minimal quantification of annotation accuracy.  \n- The architecture largely inherits from Mask2Former/nnUNet; theoretical justification for losses and hyperparameters is empirical rather than analytical.  \n- Discussion of clinical utility remains speculative—no reader study or uncertainty quantification.  \n- Minor clarity issues and formatting inconsistencies.  \n\n4. **Major Comments**\n1. **Reproducibility of Attribute Generation:** Provide quantitative assessment of LLM‑based attribute extraction (e.g., consistency with radiologist edits, κ‑scores) and describe how these structured attributes might generalize across institutions.  \n2. **Statistical Validation:** Include significance testing for Dice/NSD improvements to substantiate “state‑of‑the‑art” claims.  \n3. **Ablation Transparency:** Clarify the relative contribution of CMKI vs. multi‑positive loss on the same training split; consider a formal cross‑validation summary instead of selective examples.  \n4. **Clinical Interpretability:** The claim that Malenia “identifies specific disease categories via a knowledge table” borders on diagnostic inference; specify that this is attribute‑driven label matching, not verified clinical diagnosis.  \n5. **Open‑Source and Data Access:** Specify timelines and scope of planned code and attribute releases to meet IEEE data‑availability expectations.\n\n5. **Minor Comments**\n- Normalize typographic artifacts (e.g., hyphenation, mixed uppercase).  \n- Improve figure readability—Figure 1 and 2 contain small fonts.  \n- Provide network parameter counts per module in supplemental for clarity.  \n- Verify that all references cited as 2024 preprints are in acceptable public form.\n\n6. **Overall Recommendation**  \n**⭑ Major Revision** – The manuscript exhibits strong methodological novelty and promising results, aligning well with TMI's scope. However, additional substantiation of reproducibility, statistical rigor, and clearer separation of methodological versus application claims are required before acceptance.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** **4 / 5** – High confidence in the technical evaluation, moderate uncertainty about dataset and annotation reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \n*Malenia* represents a creative and potentially influential step toward cross‑modal zero‑shot segmentation in 3D medical imaging. With improved documentation of its annotation pipeline, quantitative statistical analyses, and clarified claims, the work could merit publication in *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents Malenia, a vision-language pre-training framework for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation in CT scans. The method addresses the challenge of transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level segmentation tasks by introducing multi-scale mask-attribute alignment and a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI) module. The approach decomposes medical reports into eight structured visual attributes (location, shape, density, etc.) and aligns these with mask representations at multiple scales using a multi-positive contrastive loss. The CMKI module enhances both visual and textual features through cross-attention mechanisms. Experiments across three datasets (MSD, KiTS23, in-house) and 12 lesion categories demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, with improvements of 6.40% DSC on MSD, 8.14% on KiTS23, and 9.08% on the in-house dataset over the best competing method.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - Equation (2) defines the multi-positive contrastive loss but lacks clear explanation of how the expectation over positive pairs is computed in practice (Section 3.1, Page 5), which affects reproducibility\n  - The notation S(m_j, t_k) = m_j·t_k/τ assumes normalized embeddings but this normalization is not explicitly stated (Section 3.1, Page 5), creating ambiguity in implementation\n  - The scaling factor √C in Equation (5) lacks justification for why this specific normalization is chosen over alternatives (Section 3.2, Page 6), undermining theoretical grounding\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - The private dataset contains only 30 cases per lesion type (Table 5, Page 16), which is insufficient for robust evaluation of zero-shot generalization capabilities\n  - Cross-validation methodology is inconsistent across datasets, with 5-fold cross-validation only reported for seen lesions (Table 2, Page 9) but not for unseen lesions, limiting statistical reliability\n  - The comparison with SAM-based methods may be unfair as they require manual prompts during testing (Table 1, Page 8), while Malenia uses stored embeddings from training, creating different evaluation conditions\n\n• **Technical approach and novelty concerns**\n  - The multi-scale alignment strategy lacks theoretical justification for why three specific resolution levels (H/32, W/32, D/32) to (H/8, W/8, D/8) are optimal (Section 3.1, Page 4), appearing arbitrary\n  - The eight visual attributes are derived from expert consultation but lack systematic validation or comparison with alternative attribute taxonomies (Section 3.1, Page 4), questioning their generalizability\n  - The CMKI module design shows limited novelty as it primarily combines standard cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms (Equation 3, Page 6) without significant architectural innovation\n\n• **Data dependency and generalization issues**\n  - The method requires extensive manual annotation by radiologists to create structured attribute descriptions (Section B.2, Page 16), which may not scale to diverse clinical settings\n  - The clinical knowledge table used during inference (Table 11, Page 25) appears manually crafted and disease-specific, potentially limiting generalization to new lesion types not covered in the predefined taxonomy\n  - The semi-automatic pipeline using GPT-4 for attribute extraction introduces dependency on proprietary models (Section 3.1, Page 5), raising concerns about reproducibility and accessibility\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and implementation clarity**\n  - Explicitly state the normalization requirements for embeddings in the similarity computation and provide pseudocode for the multi-positive contrastive loss implementation\n  - Justify the choice of √C scaling factor by comparing with alternative normalization schemes (e.g., temperature scaling, learnable parameters) in ablation studies\n  - Include detailed derivations or references for the mathematical formulations to ensure reproducibility and theoretical soundness\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation and statistical rigor**\n  - Increase the private dataset size to at least 100 cases per lesion type or provide power analysis justifying the current sample size for meaningful statistical conclusions\n  - Apply consistent cross-validation methodology across all experiments, including confidence intervals and statistical significance tests for performance comparisons\n  - Conduct fair comparisons by either providing manual prompts for SAM-based methods or developing prompt-free versions of competing approaches\n\n• **Provide systematic justification for technical choices**\n  - Conduct ablation studies on different numbers of resolution levels and specific scale choices to demonstrate the optimality of the current multi-scale design\n  - Compare the proposed eight-attribute taxonomy with alternative attribute sets through systematic evaluation or provide theoretical frameworks for attribute selection\n  - Benchmark the CMKI module against other cross-modal fusion strategies (e.g., early fusion, late fusion, attention-based fusion) to demonstrate its superiority\n\n• **Address scalability and accessibility limitations**\n  - Develop automated or semi-automated methods for attribute extraction that reduce dependency on manual annotation and proprietary models\n  - Create a systematic framework for expanding the clinical knowledge table to new lesion types, potentially using hierarchical or embedding-based approaches\n  - Provide open-source alternatives to GPT-4 for attribute extraction and validate their effectiveness in maintaining segmentation performance",

However, the construction of positives/negatives must ensure no inadvertent positives for background or false negatives due to overlapping attributes; a description of safeguards (e.g., attribute normalization, synonym handling) would improve rigor.Multi-scale alignment is technically sensible for lesions with diverse sizes and morphologies. Detailing how bipartite matching is done per scale (and stability across scales) would help others reproduce results.CMKI’s bidirectional cross-attention/self-attention is a reasonable design, and the dual-branch matching to pixel features is consistent with masked attention paradigms; an ablation on the weighting (β1, β2) and the necessity of both branches across tasks would be informative.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentThe datasets and splits are appropriate; however, more transparent counts (cases per class per set, training/test volumes per seen/unseen category) should be included in the main text. Appendix references help but key numbers should be surfaced.Zero-shot protocol needs explicit guarantees that no test-set reports or test-specific attribute texts are used to construct stored embeddings. If images with unseen lesions appear during training without segmentation labels, clarify whether their reports/attributes are used in any form.Efficiency results are deferred to the appendix; reporting wall-clock times, memory usage, and throughput for 96×96×96 patches, along with N=16 mask tokens sensitivity, would be valuable to practitioners.Additional robustness tests would strengthen the paper: performance vs lesion size bins, sensitivity to attribute noise (e.g., removing one or more attributes), and to text encoder choice (Clinical-BERT vs BioBERT/BlueBERT).\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)SAM2 (Yamagishi et al., 2024) shows strong performance for large, well-bounded organs but struggles on small/ambiguous structures; Malenia’s attribute-centric design is better aligned to lesion heterogeneity. Explicitly analyzing performance on small/low-contrast lesions could reinforce this contrast.ZePT (Jiang et al., 2024) performs query-disentangling with GPT-4/Clinical-BERT class descriptions; Malenia’s innovation is aligning to elemental attributes rather than class-level prompts and using multi-positive alignment. A controlled experiment replacing Malenia’s attributes with disease-name prompts would quantify the gain due to attribute decomposition.Mask-text alignment (e.g., MTA-CLIP) demonstrates that mask-text is preferable to pixel-text alignment in natural images. Positioning Malenia as a 3D medical instantiation that moves from class-level to attribute-level alignment is a compelling narrative; a discussion of differences in training dynamics, matching strategies, and inference usage would contextualize contributions.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe attribute-level design is clinically meaningful and could support explainability (e.g., reporting which attributes drove a segmentation). Demonstrations of attribute attribution maps or per-attribute confidence would enhance trust.Dependence on curated, institution-specific attribute vocabulary raises generalization and equity concerns; building open, standardized attribute ontologies and evaluating cross-institution generalization would be impactful next steps.The four-step inference, notably Step-IV disease identification via attribute querying, suggests a pathway towards integrated diagnosis; ethical considerations and calibrating uncertainty for clinical use should be discussed.Data governance is briefly addressed; releasing de-identified attribute templates and code for the semi-automatic structuring pipeline (prompts, QA guidelines) would materially benefit the community.\n\n- The multi-positive contrastive alignment is an appropriate objective given multiple attributes per lesion; using MP-NCE is a principled choice.

If so, how do you prevent leakage of unseen disease information through text?\n- At inference, you “store the text features of all visual attribute descriptions.” Are these the unique attribute phrases from training only, or do they include patient-specific phrasings? How are synonyms/duplicates handled and how large is this inventory?\n- Clinical Knowledge Table: How is it constructed for unseen diseases? Is it derived from external knowledge, codified by clinicians, or learned? How do you resolve conflicting attribute matches and determine thresholds/top-K for disease mapping?\n- Architectural clarity: You state Malenia is built on Mask2Former but also use nnUNet as the 3D encoder/decoder. Could you provide a precise component diagram clarifying which parts come from Mask2Former (transformer decoder, mask tokens) and which from nnUNet (feature pyramid)?\n- Matching at multiple scales: Do you perform independent bipartite matching at each scale? If matches disagree across scales, how are conflicts handled when computing Lsim?\n- CMKI ablations: How sensitive are results to the ensemble weights β1/β2, number of CMKI layers, and the choice of using self-attention in addition to cross-attention?\n- Attribute robustness: What happens if one or more of the eight attributes are missing or noisy? Can the model operate with a subset of attributes, and how does performance degrade?\n- Text encoder choice: Why Clinical-BERT over other medical encoders (e.g., PubMedBERT, Bio+Clinical BERT variants)? Can you share a comparison?\n- Baselines: For SAM/SAM2 and prompt-free adaptations, what prompt generation and hyperparameter settings were used? Were they tuned per dataset? Could you provide more details to ensure fairness?\n- Complexity: What are training/inference runtimes and GPU memory footprints per volume/patch, and how do they scale with N (mask tokens)?\n- Small lesions: Can you report performance stratified by lesion size and contrast? Where does Malenia most help relative to baselines?\n- Reproducibility: Will you release the structured-attribute extraction prompts, annotation guidelines, and the Clinical Knowledge Table to facilitate replication?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nMalenia presents a compelling approach to 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation by shifting from class-level or global text alignment to fine-grained, multi-scale mask–attribute alignment, complemented by a cross-modal fusion (CMKI) module. The method is well-motivated, reasonably designed, and demonstrates consistent gains over several recent baselines across multiple datasets. The paper’s core ideas—multi-positive attribute alignment and bidirectional mask–text fusion—are likely to be influential for open-vocabulary medical segmentation. However, several aspects require clarification and strengthening before publication at a top-tier venue: ensuring a rigorously leak-free zero-shot protocol (especially regarding text usage), expanding and detailing baseline fairness and robustness analyses, resolving architectural ambiguities, and providing more transparency on the attribute inventory and disease mapping. Addressing these points, along with releasing the structuring pipeline resources, would substantially improve the paper’s rigor, reproducibility, and impact.",

        "text": "# IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging Review Report\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of zero-shot 3D lesion segmentation, where the goal is to segment lesions from categories not encountered during training—a common scenario in clinical practice due to the diversity of pathological conditions and the difficulty of collecting comprehensive annotated datasets. The authors propose Malenia, a novel vision-language pre-training framework that bridges the gap between image-level pre-training and pixel-level segmentation through multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment. The key innovation lies in structuring medical reports into eight fundamental visual attributes (location, shape, density, etc.) and aligning these with mask tokens at multiple resolution scales using a multi-positive contrastive loss. The authors further introduce a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI) module that enhances both visual and textual representations through mutual information exchange. Extensive experiments across three datasets (MSD, KiTS23, and an in-house dataset) with 12 diverse lesion categories demonstrate that Malenia significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving average DSC improvements of 6.40%, 8.14%, and 9.08% over the best competing approaches on the respective datasets. The method also shows strong performance on seen lesions, with average improvements of 1.46% DSC on MSD and 1.35% on KiTS23 compared to fully supervised baselines.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths\n- The paper tackles a clinically significant yet underexplored problem: zero-shot lesion segmentation in 3D medical imaging, which has substantial potential for real-world deployment where new lesion types constantly emerge.\n- The multi-scale mask-attribute alignment strategy is well-motivated by clinical practice and represents a significant advancement over previous vision-language approaches that used single-scale alignment or generic report text.\n- The decomposition of medical reports into eight structured disease attributes provides a fine-grained alignment mechanism that better captures the visual semantics of lesions than previous methods.\n- The Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module effectively leverages complementary information from both modalities, with ablation studies demonstrating its clear contribution to performance.\n- The comprehensive evaluation across three diverse datasets with 12 lesion categories, including both seen and unseen lesions, provides convincing evidence of the method's effectiveness.\n\n### Major Limitations\n- The method is currently limited to CT scans, and no experiments are presented for other modalities (MRI, X-ray), which limits the demonstrated generalizability of the approach despite the clinical importance of multi-modality applications.\n- The requirement for structured attribute descriptions (rather than raw reports) may present a significant barrier to clinical adoption, as current medical reporting practices do not typically follow this structured format.\n- The paper does not adequately address computational efficiency concerns for clinical deployment, particularly regarding inference time for 3D segmentation, which is critical for clinical utility.\n- Cross-domain generalization (e.g., from abdominal to brain lesions) is not evaluated, which limits the demonstration of the method's true zero-shot capability across diverse anatomical regions.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- The ablation studies are thorough but could better quantify the individual contribution of each component (e.g., through more precise percentage improvements for specific lesion types).\n- Figure 3 (qualitative results) could benefit from higher resolution or clearer labeling to better illustrate the segmentation differences between methods.\n- The comparison with ZePT (the most relevant baseline) would be strengthened by a more detailed technical discussion in the main text rather than relegating it to the appendix.\n- The discussion on limitations (Section I) is good but could be expanded with specific, actionable suggestions for addressing each limitation in future work.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Along TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance (High):** The paper addresses an important clinical challenge with high practical relevance. The ability to segment unseen lesions without requiring additional training data or expert prompting has substantial potential to improve clinical workflow efficiency and diagnostic capabilities, particularly in resource-constrained settings where comprehensive training data for rare conditions is unavailable.\n\n**Innovation (High):** The work presents several novel contributions that advance the state of the art. The multi-scale mask-attribute alignment strategy, decomposition of reports into structured visual attributes, multi-positive contrastive learning framework, and the CMKI module collectively represent a significant conceptual and technical advancement over previous vision-language pre-training approaches for medical segmentation. The clinical motivation for using attribute-based alignment rather than raw report text is particularly compelling.\n\n**Evaluation (Good):** The evaluation is comprehensive across multiple datasets and lesion types, with appropriate metrics and statistical analysis. The ablation studies effectively demonstrate the contribution of each component. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by more detailed analysis of failure cases, particularly for the challenging \"Specific Features\" attribute where performance is lowest (82-85% DSC), and by more direct comparison with the most relevant baselines in the main text.\n\n**Reproducibility (Good):** The paper provides clear implementation details, including hyperparameters, training procedures, and dataset descriptions. The authors mention they will open-source their code and attribute annotations, which significantly enhances reproducibility. However, the dataset preprocessing details could be more explicit (e.g., exact HU windowing parameters), and the paper would benefit from more specific computational resource requirements for training and inference.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nMinor Revision\n\nThe paper presents a significant contribution to the field of zero-shot medical image segmentation with a well-motivated, innovative approach and strong experimental validation. The method demonstrates clear advantages over state-of-the-art techniques and addresses an important clinical need. However, to strengthen the paper for TMI publication, the authors should: 1) Address the limitation regarding modality generalization by discussing how the approach might extend to other imaging modalities; 2) Provide more concrete details on computational efficiency for clinical deployment; 3) Enhance the main text with more direct technical comparison to the most relevant baseline (ZePT); and 4) Expand the limitations section with specific suggestions for future work. These revisions would address the minor concerns while preserving the paper's substantial contributions and strong experimental foundation.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles an important limitation of current vision‑language pre‑training: while such models are highly effective for image‑level zero‑shot disease classification, they fall short when it comes to voxel‑level segmentation of lesions that have not been seen during training. To bridge this gap, the authors assemble a training set comprising lesions from twelve disease categories, each paired with a radiology report, using data drawn from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon, KiTS23, and a private collection. Evaluation is performed on both familiar and novel lesion types. The proposed system, named **Malenia**, introduces a multi‑scale mask‑attribute alignment that links hierarchical mask embeddings with structured textual descriptions of eight disease attributes. A multi‑positive contrastive loss is used to encourage fine‑grained correspondences. In addition, a Cross‑Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI) module fuses mask and attribute embeddings through cross‑attention, producing the final segmentation. Experiments on three datasets show consistent improvements in Dice and Normalized Surface Distance for unseen lesions, demonstrating the benefit of the mask‑attribute alignment and the cross‑modal fusion strategy.  \n\n---  \n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Relevance:** Extending vision‑language pre‑training to voxel‑level segmentation of previously unseen pathologies addresses a clear need for flexible clinical AI tools (see Introduction).  \n- **Originality:** The combination of multi‑scale mask‑attribute alignment, a multi‑positive contrastive objective, and the CMKI fusion module represents a novel departure from earlier single‑scale, single‑sentence approaches such as ZePT and CT‑GLIP (Sections 3.1‑3.2, Figure 1).  \n- **Experimental scope:** The authors benchmark Malenia against five recent zero‑shot methods (Table 1) and four supervised baselines (Table 2), reporting Dice gains of 6–9 % on unseen lesions. Ablation experiments (Tables 3‑4, Figures 4‑5) provide a clear picture of each component’s contribution. However, the lack of statistical significance testing and the relatively small size of the private in‑house dataset (≈30 cases per lesion) limit the strength of these claims (Table 1, Table 5).  \n- **Reproducibility:** The promise to release code and attribute annotations, together with a description of basic training settings (optimizer, scheduler, batch size) in Section 4.1, is encouraging. Nonetheless, essential details—such as the total number of training epochs, data‑augmentation strategies, the values of the loss‑weighting coefficients (λ₁‑λ₃), and the mechanism for storing and retrieving attribute embeddings (Figure 2)—are omitted. The dependence on GPT‑4 for attribute extraction also raises reproducibility concerns, even though an open‑source LLM alternative is examined (Table 8).  \n\n---  \n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n1. **Statistical validation:** Dice scores in Tables 1 and 2 are presented without any measure of variability (e.g., standard deviations, confidence intervals, or p‑values). Consequently, it is difficult to judge whether the reported 6–9 % improvements are statistically reliable.  \n\n2. **Training protocol details:** The manuscript does not specify the total number of training epochs, the exact learning‑rate schedule, the data‑augmentation pipeline, or the numeric values of the loss‑weighting factors λ₁, λ₂, λ₃ (Section 3.3). These omissions hinder reproducibility.  \n\n3. **Transparency of attribute extraction:** The attribute extraction pipeline relies on GPT‑4 prompts followed by radiologist correction (Section 3.1). However, the exact prompts, the amount of manual effort required, and the full workflow are not disclosed. While Table 8 shows comparable performance with an open‑source LLM, the contribution of human refinement—which appears to boost results substantially—is not quantified in the primary experiments.  \n\n4. **CMKI architecture specifics:** The description of the CMKI module remains high‑level (Section 3.2). Details such as the number of attention heads, the dimensionality of the feed‑forward layers, and the balance between cross‑ and self‑attention layers are missing. Table 4 documents overall gains but does not isolate the effect of each fusion step.  \n\n5. **Mask‑token count justification:** Figure 4 indicates a performance drop when using fewer than 12 tokens, leading the authors to adopt N = 16 as the default. Nevertheless, the study does not explore dataset‑specific tuning (e.g., adjusting token count based on lesion class frequency within a volume).  \n\n6. **Limited size of the private dataset:** The in‑house dataset comprises only 30 scans per lesion type (Table 5) and provides scant information about acquisition protocols. This raises concerns about potential bias and limits the assessment of generalizability beyond the three public datasets.  \n\n7. **Zero‑shot claim nuances:** Malenia depends on pre‑computed “stored attribute embeddings” derived from the training set (Section 3.3). It is unclear how the system would handle a truly novel disease that lacks any prior attribute description, which somewhat contradicts a strict zero‑shot scenario.  \n\n8. **Computational cost reporting:** Table 10 lists FLOPs for a 96³ input, but does not include real‑world inference latency, memory footprint, or runtime on full‑size CT volumes—information that is essential for evaluating clinical feasibility.  \n\n9. **Qualitative analysis without quantitative error metrics:** Figures 3 and 7 present appealing visual examples, yet there is no accompanying quantitative analysis of false‑positive/false‑negative rates or boundary accuracy.  \n\n10. **Manuscript polish:** The text contains typographical errors (e.g., “SegmenTA## TION”) and inconsistent spacing that distract from the scientific content and should be corrected.  \n\n---  \n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision** – While the work is promising and tackles a worthwhile problem, the manuscript requires additional baseline comparisons, statistical analyses, and detailed methodological information before it can be considered for publication.",

It aims to train well-generalized models from a large number of images that follow a long-tailed class distribution. In the medical field, many diagnostic imaging exams such as dermoscopy and chest radiography yield a long-tailed distribution of complex clinical findings. Recently, long-tailed learning in medical image analysis has garnered significant attention. However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often leads to unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. To help the community improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called Medical OpeN-source Long-taIled ClassifiCAtion (MONICA), which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and evaluated on 12 long-tailed medical datasets covering 6 medical domains. Our work provides valuable practical guidance and insights for the field, offering detailed analysis and discussion on the effectiveness of individual components within the inbuilt state-of-the-art methodologies. We hope this codebase serves as a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark, encouraging further advancements in long-tailed medical image learning.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a framework and codebase for structured benchmarking of long-tailed (LT) learning methods on various medical image classification tasks. The benchmark, MONICA, implements over 30 LT learning methods, with comprehensive experiments assessing performance across 12 LT medical image classification datasets spanning 6 different modalities. The experiments analyze which methods, and categories of methods, provide the most benefit to LT medical image classification across tasks in a controlled environment.\n\n### Soundness: 4\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n- This work addresses an important problem, namely the variability in dataset/hyperparameters/etc. when evaluating LT learning methods for medical image classification tasks. These variations in setting make head-to-head comparisons difficult, so MONICA serves to provide a “fair playing ground” for these LT learning methods.\n- The framework will become publicly available and should serve as an extensible resource going forward for LT medical image classification research.\n- The organization and presentation quality of the paper is strong, with helpful use of formatting (typesetting, color, etc.) and high-quality figures.\n- Experiments are very thorough, spanning many relevant methods, datasets, and tasks.\n- Discussion is thoughtful, going beyond simply displaying all benchmark results. The authors try to synthesize takeaways, provide caveats/limitations, assess out-of-distribution performance, and more.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Writing can be improved throughout. See specific comments below for examples of awkward wording, inconsistent naming, grammatical errors, etc.\n- It is possible that choosing a fixed set of hyperparameters across methods unintentionally advantages certain methods. Ideally, one could argue that each method should be individually tuned on each task; however, I am aware that this would require a vast amount of resources and time, so I do not consider this a major limitation. More practical solutions to enhance the benchmark would be the following: (i) uncertainty estimates should be provided (e.g., bootstrapped confidence intervals or standard deviations over multiple runs), and (ii) multiple performance metrics should be provided (e.g., AUROC).\n\n### Questions\n\n- Is it possible that the chosen hyperparameters used across all methods happen to be more advantageous for certain methods and suboptimal for others? In one sense, using the same set of hyperparameters across methods appears “fair”; however, it may actually be more fair to individually tune each method on each task. I recognize the difficulty of conducting fair comparisons in such a large-scale experimental setting, where it is costly to, e.g., run multiple trials of all experiments. I am not asking the authors to necessarily perform such experiments, but rather to consider this point and perhaps comment on it as a limitation/consideration.\n- Can the authors provide a summary of practical suggestions for which methods to use in a few sentences near the Conclusion?\n- I might suggest including the **rank** of each method on a given task in all tables. This would also enable you to *quantitatively* assess method performance across tasks (which method has the lowest average/median rank overall?). To make this work logistically (fit all columns in the table), you may need to reduce the precision to one decimal place, e.g.\n- The two paragraphs “LTMIC improves out-of-distribution detection” and “Using imbalanced validation dataset for checkpoint selection” are not properly set up. For the former, what does it mean to use “ImageNet as OOD samples, with 1,000 randomly selected images”? What exactly is the task, how is it formulated, and how are experiments conducted? Further, why do we care about this model behavior? For the former, Figure 4 and its findings are confusing – why exactly does this demonstrate “stable convergence”? My general advice: **Use the methods section to describe and prepare the reader to understand everything that appears in the results**. When I come to these results sections, I should already have an idea of what experiments you have performed.\n\n**Minor comments/questions:**\n- Avoid editorializing with value judgments: “benchmark is **meticulously** designed”; “we… develop a… **well-structured** codebase”; “our work provides **valuable** practical guidance”. Simply present your work and let the reader make these judgments!\n- “data imbalance learning” is not a phrase I have heard. Perhaps “imbalanced learning”?\n- “unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark”. Unsure what “strictly formulated” means. Could simply say “unified, comprehensive benchmark”\n- “we build a… codebase…, which implements over 30 methods… and evaluated on 12… datasets”. It seems that “evaluated on” is the wrong tense; also, what is being evaluated?\n- This does not belong in an abstract: “We hope this codebase serves as a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark, encouraging further advancements in long-tailed medical image learning.”\n- Often unnecessary inclusion of “the” before concepts: “The deep learning techniques”; “the collected image datasets”; “the long-tailed imbalance”\n- “The deep learning techniques have proven effective for most computer vision tasks benefiting from the grown-up dataset scale.” Remove “The”; what does “grown-up dataset scale” mean? “Grown-up” is not the right adjective – be more concrete.\n- Refrain from claims like “always result” (line 57) – soften to “usually” or similar\n- Confused by this justification: “it is vital to recognize these rare diseases in real-world practice, as they are relatively rare for doctors and may also lack diagnostic capacity.” This reads as “it is vital to recognize rare diseases because they are rare”.\n- Line 65: can change “contributions, i.e.,” -> “contributions:”\n- Be consistent with capitalization/presentation of terms: “Re-sampling” vs “re-sampling”; “Module improvement” vs. “Module Improvement”; “mnist” vs. “MNIST”; “mixup” vs. “MixUp”; etc.\n- Line 82: “we are still curious to explore”. Perhaps just “we aim to explore”?\n- “The partition schemes are vita important”. What does “vita” mean?\n- The last two paragraphs of the introduction are probably better off being formatted as bulleted or numbered lists. Also, it is unclear why these numbered lists are formatted differently: **1) xxx.** vs. (1) xxx.\n- “of class $k$ where $\\rho$ denoted as imbalance ratio”. The phrase “denoted as” is awkward + need a comma after $k$\n- “a common assumption in long-tailed learning is when the classes are sorted by cardinality in decreasing order” I’m not sure what this means or why this represents an “assumption”. I would just remove this sentence since it does not seem to be used later.\n- Line 144: “is a long-tailed version constructed from”. Need to say it is a version “of” something; alternatively, use a word other than “version” like “dataset”\n- Inconsistent spacing/use of commas in numbers. “10, 015” -> “10,015”; “3200 fundus images” -> “3,200 fundus images”\n- Inconsistent spacing around commas and colons: “training/off-site testing / on-site testin”; “7 : 1: 2”; etc.\n- “Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark” -> “the Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark”\n- I realize it is hard to categorize some methods into one bin but GCL loss going in Information Augmentation is interesting, particularly since all other losses fall under re-sampling. It seems to also have module improvement as well.\n- “Causal classifier (Tang et al., 2020) resorted to causal inference for keeping the good and removing the bad momentum causal effects in long-tailed learning.” The phrase “resorted to” is strange and has a negative connotation; also, what do “good” and “bad” mean?\n- “All these designs are for the fairness and the practicality of the comparison on the benchmark.” Too vague – in what specific way do these support fairness?\n- Table 3: Inconsistent “Avg” vs “Avg.” vs “avg”\n- Table 4: Consider using a line break occasionally (so one loss function occupies two rows). This would allow you to use a larger font size. Also, be consistent “CrossEntropy” vs “CE”?\n- “assessing MixUp based solely on performance is not fair”. Soften to “may not be fair”\n- “led to a significant performance decline, e.g,”. Refrain from saying “significant” without statistical significance test + change “e.g,” -> “e.g.,”\n- “Use two-stage training as a general paradigm” sounds like a command. Perhaps “Using”?\n- Define “SSL” acronym at first use\n- “Modify classifier to reduce prediction bias” -> “Classifier modification to reduce prediction bias”\n- “In Fig. 2, We visualize” -> “In Fig. 2, we visualize”\n- Table 5 indicates the meaning of asterisk, which is never used in the table.\n- “models with larger parameters”. The parameters are not “larger” – could say “more parameters” or “a larger parameter count” perhaps.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

It includes implementation of more than 30 LT methods and provides comprehensive experiments across 12 datasets representing six imaging modalities.

The work is clearly motivated, well-organized, and visually well-presented, though the writing at times lacks polish.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological Fairness and Hyperparameters:** Using a single set of hyperparameters for all methods may unintentionally favor some approaches and disadvantage others. While individualized tuning would improve fairness, it may be infeasible at this scale. The authors should at least acknowledge this limitation and discuss potential impacts.  \n2. **Benchmark Completeness:** Including uncertainty estimates (e.g., bootstrapped confidence intervals, multiple-run standard deviations) and additional metrics such as AUROC would strengthen the benchmark and improve interpretability.  \n3. **Experimental Clarity:** Certain results sections are insufficiently motivated.

These experiments should be better explained in the Methods section to prepare readers for the results.  \n4. **Practical Guidance:** The conclusion could summarize practical recommendations—e.g., which LT methods are generally most effective—based on the benchmark’s findings.  \n5. **Presentation of Results:** Including ranks of methods in each table could facilitate cross-task performance comparison (e.g., average or median rank).  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Simplify subjective language (“meticulously designed,” “valuable guidance”).  \n- Improve grammatical consistency and phrasing throughout (e.g., remove unnecessary “the,” revise tense, clarify ambiguous expressions).  \n- Ensure consistent capitalization and naming of terms and tables.  \n- Revise unclear sentences (“vital to recognize rare diseases because they are rare”), fix typos (“vita important”), and correct formatting inconsistencies in numbers, spacing, and notation.  \n- Clarify or soften specific phrases (“assessing MixUp solely on performance may not be fair”).  \n- Define all acronyms at first use (e.g., SSL).  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, **MONICA** addresses an important gap by providing a unified, extensible benchmark for LT medical image classification.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a unified benchmark for long-tailed learning in the medical domain by integrating several existing datasets and implementing a complete pipeline from data loading to model training and evaluation. The authors claim that the benchmark supports over 30 methods for comparison and provides an analysis of their performances.\n\n- Update after the discussion phase:\n\nThank you for the detailed responses! I've raised my score. While my concerns are not entirely resolved, I believe with careful revisions, its future version has the potential to be accepted.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper attempts to provide a comprehensive benchmark for long-tailed medical image classification. The idea of integrating multiple existing methods and datasets into a unified platform could potentially be useful for researchers who want to compare various methodologies under a standardized framework.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. Motivation. The paper lacks sufficient justification for evaluating long-tailed problems specifically in medical imaging tasks. While the authors mention some motivations at the beginning, these arguments are not convincing. Is there a fundamental difference between long-tailed problems in medical imaging and those in conventional tasks? Would this difference necessitate different methodologies? Even if the data modalities and evaluation methods are distinct (e.g., balanced vs. imbalanced test sets), would this lead to fundamentally different approaches? The paper analyzes multiple methods based on this premise but fails to provide insightful conclusions, which further deepens my skepticism about the motivation.\n\n2. Dataset Contribution. Although the paper claims to use 12 datasets, 7 of these come from MedMNIST, and several of them are derived from previous work. This reduces the originality of the dataset contribution. Furthermore, the split between multi-class and multi-label datasets is 9/3, respectively. It is worth noting that many existing studies have already utilized MedMNIST for long-tailed learning (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11226954386823169312&scipsc=1&q=long+tail). Given that 7 out of the 12 datasets in this paper are from MedMNIST, why should users choose MONICA over MedMNIST, which already has extensive use and coverage in the medical imaging field? Additionally, the experimental methods used for multi-class and multi-label datasets are almost entirely different, and the analysis of multi-label results is limited to a single vague statement that multi-label classification is more challenging. This gives the impression that multi-label datasets were included just for the sake of completeness, rather than being a key focus.\n\n3. Code Contribution. The code is not provided in the appendix, nor is there an anonymous GitHub link, which means the authors' claims about the code cannot be verified. By comparison, the NeurIPS D&B track (single-blind review) usually includes dataset or code links, along with information about author affiliations, licenses, and ethics. Although such links may be added after acceptance, this suggests that such work may not be well-suited for ICLR's double-blind review process.\n\n    Additionally, the description of the code structure in Section 3.1 is not particularly informative. The modular design described is basic and lacks novel insights. A more impactful modular design, like in mmdetection, which breaks down components into backbone, neck, and bbox head, would have been more meaningful. As it stands, the description feels unnecessary.\n\n4. Experimental Analysis Lacks of Insights. Comments below:\n\n    - Despite using multiple datasets, the authors only provide a generic / systematic comparison of the methods without analyzing differences across domains. For example, there is no discussion about which methods are better suited for dermatology versus ophthalmology. Almost all discussion is very general, without any specific insights related to medical applications. This diminishes the value of using 12 datasets, as the conclusions drawn are not substantially different from what could be obtained from a single dataset.\n\n    - The analysis in Section 4.2 is poorly organized. There is no clear structure, with the discussion jumping from evaluation metrics (e.g., \"Curse of shot-based group evaluation\") to re-sampling methods, MixUp, two-stage training, and even self-supervised learning in a seemingly random fashion. Many claims are also not supported by data. The overall takeaway from the experimental section is unclear, and I did not gain any insights on how to design better models.\n\n    - In Section 4.1, there is inconsistency in the training strategies used: some methods use a unified training strategy, while others use the one specified in the original paper (e.g., SAM, Line 306), with no explanation for this discrepancy.\n\n    - There are issues with the tables, such as Table 2, where it is unclear what methods like ERM, cRT, and LWS represent, as they are not referenced properly. Additionally, Section 3.2.3 does not fully align with the table.\n\n    - The categorization of methods is confusing. The authors categorize methods into three types—class re-sampling, information augmentation, and module improvement—but later mention that re-sampling and MixUp are used in many methods, making the classification in Tables 2/3 somewhat meaningless.\n\n    - The discussion on self-supervised learning (Line 398) appears out of place, as it is not introduced earlier.\n\n    - Similarly, the mention of OOD detection (Line 421) is abrupt and lacks context.\n\n    - The section on using an imbalanced validation dataset for checkpoint selection is unclear about its purpose. The conclusion seems to be that GCL exhibits lower fluctuations, but the reasoning and implications are not well explained. Additionally, Figure 4 lacks labels for the x and y axes, making interpretation difficult.\n\n    - Line 475 suddenly states that multi-label classification is more challenging without providing adequate context or analysis.\n\n    - Line 504 claims that \"the most advanced long-tailed learning methods no longer focus on improving a single strategy,\" but this claim is not well-supported by the preceding analysis.\n\n### Questions\n\nSee weakness sections. Some more questions below:\n\nCould you elaborate on why the results of self-supervised learning and OOD detection are relevant in this paper? They seem out of place given the main focus on long-tailed classification.\n\nWhy did the authors not include a domain-specific analysis (e.g., which methods work better for certain medical fields)? It seems like an important missed opportunity.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

It aims to offer a comprehensive evaluation pipeline covering data loading, training, and assessment. The overall presentation is clear, but the work’s novelty and depth of analysis are limited. Following the authors’ responses, the reviewer raised their overall assessment, acknowledging the effort while noting unresolved concerns that may be addressed through revision.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Motivation and Rationale** – The justification for focusing on long-tailed problems specifically within medical imaging is insufficient. The paper does not convincingly explain how long-tailed distributions in this domain differ from other fields or why unique methodologies are needed. Despite extensive experiments, the lack of domain-specific insights weakens the paper’s motivation.  \n2. **Dataset Contribution and Originality** – Of the 12 datasets used, seven originate from MedMNIST, diminishing the originality of the benchmark. Since MedMNIST is already widely used for similar purposes, the added value of the proposed MONICA benchmark remains unclear. The imbalance between multi-class and multi-label datasets and the minimal analysis of multi-label results make their inclusion appear superficial.  \n3. **Code Availability and Transparency** – No code or anonymous repository link is provided, preventing verification of claims. The description of the modular code design is basic and offers little novel insight compared with existing frameworks such as mmdetection.  \n4. **Experimental Analysis and Organization** – The analysis lacks structure and depth. Comparisons across medical domains are absent, and discussions are mostly generic. Method categorization is inconsistent, tables and section references are unclear, and several claims lack supporting data. The flow between topics (e.g., self-supervision, OOD detection, validation strategy) is disjointed, hindering comprehension and insights.  \n5. **Specific Methodological Issues** – Inconsistencies exist in training strategies among methods, unclear table labeling, and abrupt introductions of certain topics. Figures lack proper axis labels, and key conclusions (e.g., that multi-label classification is “more challenging”) are not substantiated.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Ensure consistent referencing of methods (e.g., ERM, cRT, LWS) and alignment between text and tables.  \n- Improve figure labeling and clarify section transitions.  \n- Provide stronger linking of results to claims throughout Sections 4.1–4.2.  \n- Clarify the purpose and interpretation of the imbalanced validation experiments.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper’s goal of creating a unified long-tailed benchmark for medical imaging is potentially valuable, but current shortcomings in motivation, dataset originality, code transparency, and analysis depth limit its impact. The experimental presentation is fragmented, and key conclusions are not fully supported by results.

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript addresses the challenge of long-tailed medical image classification by introducing *MONICA*, a benchmarking package designed to evaluate a variety of methods—such as different loss functions and data augmentations—across multiple medical imaging datasets. The work provides an overview of curated datasets, methods, and their experimental performance, alongside a summary of key observations. The paper is clearly structured and practical for researchers in medical imaging, though certain methodological and evaluation aspects could be strengthened.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. The benchmarking suite could be expanded to include more canonical and widely used medical datasets (e.g., Camelyon for pathology, the medical subset of WILDS), which would enhance generality and field relevance.  \n2. The use of ResNet-50 as the sole backbone is outdated; the community has largely transitioned to more advanced architectures (e.g., ConvNeXt, Swin, or foundation models).  \n3. Pretraining strategies should be considered, as training backbones from scratch is uncommon and may hinder performance comparisons.  \n4. While fairness is maintained by reusing the same backbone across tasks, exploring a range of backbones could demonstrate robustness across modalities and problem types.  \n5. Top-1 accuracy is not an ideal metric for evaluating models under class imbalance; metrics such as AUROC, AUPRC, or F1-score would be more suitable.  \n6. Experimental results lack error bars, and further error analysis would strengthen claims.  \n7. The discussion of novel insights is somewhat limited; clearer articulation would increase the contribution’s impact.  \n8. The connection to clinical relevance should be elaborated to contextualize the work’s practical significance.  \n9. Additional ablation studies are recommended to better characterize model behaviors and design trade-offs.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Consider discussing trends observed across tasks to narrow the design space for future work.  \n- The manuscript could benefit from comments on whether stronger backbones or more complex augmentation techniques (e.g., AugMix, learned augmentations) were considered.  \n- No ethical issues are identified.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper presents a useful and well-organized benchmarking framework with practical value for the community. Its strengths lie in dataset curation, code modularization, and broad coverage of methods. However, limitations in dataset diversity, backbone selection, metric choice, and experimental depth reduce the study’s impact and clarity of insights. Addressing these issues would substantially improve the work’s rigor and generalizability.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The paper offers a meaningful contribution but requires expanded datasets, stronger baselines, improved evaluation metrics, and deeper analysis to reach publishable quality.",

        "text": "**Phase 1. Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript, *MONICA: Benchmarking on Long-Tailed Medical Image Classification*, develops and releases a large-scale benchmark and modular codebase for evaluating long-tailed learning (LTL) algorithms within medical imaging classification tasks. While the work does not introduce a novel algorithm or theoretical contribution in imaging methodology per se, it addresses a significant methodological gap — the lack of standardized, reproducible evaluation and fair comparison across long-tailed medical imaging datasets. Given that IEEE TMI occasionally publishes benchmark or methodological synthesis papers that materially advance the reproducibility and methodological understanding of imaging AI systems, the scope can be considered **conditionally relevant**. However, the contribution is more infrastructural and empirical than fundamentally methodological.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \n⚠️ The core novelty resides in curating and unifying 12 medical datasets, incorporating 30+ long-tailed methods into a coherent codebase, and empirically analyzing their cross-domain generalization. These are useful engineering and benchmarking contributions, but the methodological novelty is low—no new loss function or model architecture is proposed. The paper’s unique contribution is thus its comprehensiveness, reproducibility, and analysis rather than scientific innovation. This positions the work **below the typical TMI novelty threshold**, although it has practical value.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe paper demonstrates strong experimental organization: unified training pipelines, cross-validation protocols, extensive comparisons, and consistent baselines. Tables 2–5 are detailed, and implementation transparency is high (code release promised). However:  \n- Statistical significance or uncertainty analysis (e.g., standard deviations, CIs) is missing.  \n- Many experimental decisions (hyperparameters, group thresholds) appear heuristic.  \n- Multi-label evaluation could be more rigorous; e.g., exact mean average precision values and per-class calibration are not included.  \n- No theoretical analysis or in-depth model interpretability assessment.  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nOverall clear and readable. The manuscript is lengthy but well structured; tables and figures are legible. Minor grammar and phrasing inconsistencies appear (“vita important,” “we will shortly introduce” etc.). Figures could use higher resolution or graphical consistency (e.g., Fig. 3–4 fonts).  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nThe datasets referenced are all public (e.g., ISIC, CheXpert, MedMNIST). There is no human data collection in this work. Ethical compliance and anonymization are hence adequate. Reproducibility is strong, with clear modular design and promised GitHub release.  \n\n---\n\n**Phase 2. IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThis paper presents **MONICA**, a comprehensive open-source benchmark for **long-tailed medical image classification (LTMIC)**. It integrates 12 publicly available datasets across 6 medical domains (dermatology, ophthalmology, radiology, pathology, hematology, histology, gastroenterology) and over 30 long-tailed learning algorithms grouped into resampling, data augmentation, and module-modification methods. The authors evaluate these under uniform training conditions (mainly ResNet‑50 backbone, Adam optimizer) and provide detailed cross-dataset comparisons, highlighting empirical insights into what factors drive performance differences across imbalance levels and dataset modalities.\n\n**2. Strengths**  \n- First unified and reproducible benchmark addressing long-tailed imbalance for medical imaging.  \n- Integrates diverse datasets and 30+ SOTA LTL algorithms, providing immediate utility to the community.  \n- Transparent and modular codebase structure; practical resource for fair comparison.  \n- Methodological findings (e.g., interplay between resampling and classifier normalization, importance of two-stage training) offer empirical guidance.  \n- Strong reproducibility plan and detailed documentation.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**  \n- Limited methodological novelty: mostly repackages and systematizes existing methods.  \n- Statistical rigor is limited — no confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, or extensive ablation studies.  \n- Evaluation metrics focus on accuracy/mAP; lacks calibration, uncertainty, or clinical interpretation analysis relevant to medical imaging applications.  \n- Multi-label LTMIC discussion is brief and not deeply explored.  \n- Conclusions are largely descriptive without deeper methodological insight or theoretical generalization.\n\n**4. Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological Novelty & Positioning** – Clarify the positioning of MONICA: Is it proposed as a *benchmark paper* or an *algorithmic contribution*? For TMI readership, emphasize its utility for methodological validation and reproducibility, rather than as a new method. Consider reframing contributions accordingly.  \n2. **Statistical and Uncertainty Analysis** – Report variance over multiple training runs and statistical comparisons between methods. Include significance testing or confidence intervals for at least a subset of key results (Table 2–3).  \n3. **Evaluation Metrics** – Expand to include calibration metrics (e.g., ECE, Brier score) to align better with TMI’s focus on clinically reliable AI.  \n4. **Multi-label Classification Section** – Deepen this section: describe evaluation metrics (exact mAP computation), address label co-occurrence quantitatively, and elaborate on class-wise distributions.  \n5. **Clinical Interpretation & Relevance** – Discuss how the benchmark insights might influence clinical deployment or development of medically robust algorithms (e.g., rare disease detection, regulatory validation).  \n6. **Benchmark Maintenance** – Describe future update strategy (versioning, dataset expansion) for reproducibility and long-term community usage.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**  \n- Minor wording issues: correct typographical errors (“vita important,” “Re-search” → “Research”).  \n- Standardize the capitalization and naming of methods and datasets.  \n- Some tables (e.g., Table 2–3) are dense—consider highlighting top-performing methods in each category.  \n- Include GitHub link upon release for verification.  \n- Clarify figures (axes labels in Fig. 2–4 somewhat small).  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n⚠️ **Reject (Out of Scope / Low Novelty)**  \nWhile technically solid and valuable as a benchmarking resource, the work predominantly provides an organizational framework and comparative analysis rather than a new methodological advancement in imaging science. IEEE TMI prioritizes methodological innovation or theoretical insight; this paper would be more suited to journals emphasizing open resources and applied benchmarking (e.g., *Medical Image Analysis – Datasets and Benchmarks track* or *Scientific Data*).  \nIf the authors can include novel evaluation methodology (e.g., new metric for imbalance calibration, theoretical rationale for algorithm behaviors) or deeper analysis of medical imaging–specific LTL phenomena, re-submission to TMI could be reconsidered.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nValuable benchmarking contribution with strong engineering and reproducibility merit but insufficient methodological innovation for IEEE TMI’s core scope. Recommend redirection to a benchmark- or data-oriented venue, or substantial reframing to include analytic or theoretical advancement suitable for TMI.",

The authors implement over 30 state-of-the-art long-tailed learning methodologies across 12 medical datasets spanning 6 medical domains (dermatology, ophthalmology, radiology, pathology, hematology, histology, gastroenterology). The benchmark addresses the lack of unified evaluation frameworks in long-tailed medical image learning by providing a modular codebase with standardized experimental protocols. Key findings include: (1) methods combining re-sampling, information augmentation, and module improvements (like GCL) achieve superior performance, (2) two-stage training paradigms offer significant flexibility, (3) simple re-sampling strategies remain effective baselines, and (4) multi-label classification presents additional complexities compared to multi-class tasks. The work aims to establish fair comparison standards and provide practical guidance for researchers developing long-tailed medical image classification systems.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Insufficient mathematical formulation clarity and consistency**\n  - The problem definition in Section 2.1 (lines 108-119) uses inconsistent notation, where π represents both a vector and individual frequencies, creating ambiguity in mathematical interpretation\n  - The imbalance ratio definition ρ = n1/nk lacks clear specification of which classes n1 and nk represent, particularly given the ordering assumption\n  - Multi-label formulation introduces LCard metric (line 118) without proper mathematical context or connection to the main problem formulation\n\n• **Limited experimental rigor and statistical validation**\n  - No statistical significance testing is reported across the extensive results in Tables 2, 3, and 5, making it impossible to distinguish meaningful performance differences from noise\n  - Single-run experiments without confidence intervals or multiple trials weaken the reliability of comparative conclusions, particularly given the modest performance differences observed\n  - Hyperparameter selection methodology is not systematically described (Section 4.1, lines 281-288), potentially introducing bias in method comparisons\n\n• **Inadequate baseline establishment and evaluation protocol**\n  - The choice of ResNet-50 as the unified backbone (line 284) is not justified against other architectures, limiting generalizability of conclusions\n  - Missing ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual components within complex methods like GCL, making it difficult to understand which aspects drive performance improvements\n  - Validation set construction methodology varies inconsistently across datasets (Table 1), compromising the fairness of cross-dataset comparisons\n\n• **Incomplete coverage of relevant methodologies and recent advances**\n  - Several important recent long-tailed learning methods are mentioned as implemented but excluded from results presentation without clear justification criteria\n  - Self-supervised learning exploration (lines 407-420) is dismissed too readily based on limited experimentation, despite its potential relevance to medical imaging\n  - Multi-label long-tailed learning receives insufficient treatment given its clinical importance, with methods evaluation limited to basic adaptations\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical precision and notation consistency**\n  - Revise Section 2.1 to use distinct notation for the frequency vector π and individual class frequencies πk, providing clear mathematical definitions for all symbols\n  - Explicitly define the class ordering convention and specify that ρ represents the ratio between most frequent and least frequent classes\n  - Provide rigorous mathematical formulation for multi-label metrics and their relationship to the core long-tailed learning problem\n\n• **Strengthen experimental methodology with statistical validation**\n  - Conduct multiple independent runs for all experiments and report mean performance with confidence intervals or standard deviations\n  - Apply appropriate statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to validate performance differences between methods\n  - Establish systematic hyperparameter selection protocols using validation sets and document the optimization process for reproducibility\n\n• **Develop comprehensive baseline evaluation framework**\n  - Justify the backbone architecture choice through systematic comparison with alternatives (e.g., Vision Transformers, EfficientNets) on representative datasets\n  - Include detailed ablation studies for complex methods to isolate the contribution of individual components\n  - Standardize validation set construction methodology across all datasets to ensure fair comparison protocols\n\n• **Expand methodological coverage and analysis depth**\n  - Include results for all implemented methods with clear criteria for inclusion/exclusion in the main results presentation\n  - Conduct more systematic exploration of self-supervised learning with proper hyperparameter tuning and augmentation strategies tailored to medical imaging\n  - Develop specialized evaluation protocols and metrics for multi-label long-tailed learning that account for label co-occurrence patterns and clinical relevance",

Key findings highlight patterns in the effectiveness of method combinations, training strategies, and the additional complexity of multi-label classification tasks. Overall, the manuscript is comprehensive in scope and offers a valuable foundation for reproducible and fair assessment of long-tailed classification methods in medical imaging, though several methodological and presentation issues limit its rigor and interpretability.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Mathematical clarity and notation consistency** – Section 2.1 contains inconsistent notation, where a single symbol (π) is used for both a vector and its elements, creating ambiguity. The imbalance ratio ρ = n₁/nₖ is introduced without clear specification of which classes these represent, and the multi-label formulation introduces the LCard metric without formal definition or connection to the main framework.  \n2. **Experimental rigor and statistical validation** – The evaluation lacks statistical testing, confidence intervals, or multiple experimental runs. Without such analysis, observed performance differences cannot be confirmed as significant. Additionally, the hyperparameter selection process is insufficiently documented, raising reproducibility concerns.  \n3. **Baseline and evaluation protocol limitations** – The exclusive use of ResNet-50 as the unified backbone is not justified, and no ablation studies are provided for complex models such as GCL, limiting interpretability. Variation in validation set construction across datasets further undermines fair comparison.  \n4. **Incomplete methodological coverage** – Several implemented methods are omitted from results without stated criteria.

It evaluates over 30 methodologies across 12 long-tailed medical datasets spanning 6 medical domains, aiming to provide a unified framework for assessing the performance of various long-tailed learning methods. The authors argue that this benchmark addresses the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks in the field and offers valuable insights into the effectiveness of different methodologies. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for creating a standardized benchmark is clear.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the introduction of MONICA is a valuable contribution, the manuscript should provide a clearer distinction between existing benchmarks and MONICA's unique contributions. For instance, the authors could elaborate on how MONICA differs from other long-tailed learning benchmarks, such as those used in natural image recognition. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of previous benchmarks and how MONICA addresses these limitations would strengthen the paper's novelty.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted on a diverse set of datasets, which is commendable. However, the reliance on Pareto-distributed training sets for multi-class classification tasks may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios, especially in multi-label classification. The authors should discuss the implications of this choice and possibly include more realistic imbalance scenarios. Furthermore, the inclusion of a broader range of medical imaging modalities and tasks could enhance the benchmark's applicability and robustness.\n\n3. Comparisons: While the manuscript includes a comprehensive set of baseline methods, the authors should ensure that the comparison includes the most recent and relevant long-tailed learning methods. For instance, the inclusion of recent advancements in self-supervised learning and domain-specific techniques would provide a more complete picture of the current state of the art. Additionally, the manuscript should explicitly state whether the implementations of these methods are based on the authors' own implementations or third-party codebases, to clarify reproducibility concerns.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript states that the codebase will be made publicly available, but the details provided on the implementation and training protocols are insufficient for full reproducibility. The authors should provide a more detailed description of the hyperparameters, data preprocessing steps, and any other necessary configurations to ensure that the results can be independently replicated. Additionally, a clear plan for releasing the codebase and maintaining it would be beneficial.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 2 and 3 are cluttered and could benefit from a more streamlined presentation. Showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions would improve readability.\n\n2. Section 2.1: The introduction of notation in Section 2.1 lacks sufficient explanation. In particular, the forward operator is denoted inconsistently.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition.\n\n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7) should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: evaluating the performance of long-tailed learning methods in medical image classification. The introduction of MONICA as a comprehensive benchmark is technically interesting and could represent a meaningful innovation if convincingly distinguished from related benchmarks. However, the evaluation is limited to Pareto-distributed datasets, which may not fully capture real-world complexity. Additionally, the reproducibility of the approach is uncertain due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, while the idea has promise, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand comparative analysis, strengthen validation across datasets and modalities, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

The study standardizes training and evaluation pipelines, reports extensive results with head/medium/tail breakdowns, and offers practical insights into re-sampling, augmentation, and module-improvement strategies (e.g., two-stage training, classifier normalization). It aims to provide a reproducible, unified framework to guide method selection and future research in LTMIC.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationA unified, modular codebase that decouples augmentation, sampling, model backbones/heads, and losses, easing fair comparisons and method composition.Broad integration of 30+ long-tailed learning techniques across three main paradigms (re-sampling, information augmentation, module improvements), plus preliminary SSL and OOD extensions.Useful methodological synthesis and practical guidance (e.g., two-stage training as a general paradigm;

If so, which variants, and are results sensitive to pretraining? If not, why, given common medical practice?\n- How were hyperparameters chosen for each method? Did you allow any method-specific tuning (e.g., loss margins, temperatures) or strictly fix global defaults? Could you provide a small per-method tuning budget to reduce bias?\n- Can you report multi-seed results (e.g., 3–5 runs) with mean±std for the key tables to quantify variability, especially in tail classes?\n- For multi-class medical datasets, can you add AUC, macro F1, balanced accuracy, and calibration metrics (ECE/Brier) to align with clinical evaluation standards?\n- The text mentions filtering out methods that do not beat ERM “to avoid redundancy,” yet the tables include sub-ERM methods. What is the final policy on reporting? For a benchmark, would you include all results (including negative ones) in an appendix?\n- Several dataset statistics appear inconsistent (e.g., punctuation in counts, ISIC val/test sizes). Can you clarify and correct these numbers, and provide a consolidated data card per dataset?\n- For CheXpert, why map uncertain labels to negative rather than using uncertainty-aware loss or label smoothing? How sensitive are results to this decision?\n- Could you include medical-domain LTL methods (e.g., ECL, SPMix) or justify their exclusion? If resource-limited, could you at least position these works and discuss expected behavior on your benchmark?\n- Can you provide training-time/resource comparisons and a discussion of method scalability (e.g., SAM, BBN, multi-expert methods) to inform practical deployment?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper presents a timely and potentially impactful benchmark and codebase for long-tailed medical image classification. Its breadth of datasets, integration of a large suite of methods, and pragmatic insights (two-stage training, classifier normalization, resampling as a strong baseline) are valuable for the community. However, to reach top-tier benchmark standards, the work should strengthen experimental rigor and clinical relevance: report multi-seed variability, add clinically standard metrics (AUC, calibration), correct and document dataset splits/statistics, clarify hyperparameter policies, and minimize reporting bias by including all results. Broader positioning against domain-specific LTL methods and modern logit/gradient adjustment techniques would further enhance completeness. With these improvements, MONICA could serve as a robust reference point for LTMIC research and deployment.",

Opening Paragraph\n\nThe manuscript addresses the critical challenge of long-tailed learning in medical image classification, where datasets exhibit highly imbalanced class distributions with rare conditions having limited training samples—a common scenario in clinical practice where rare but serious conditions must be accurately identified despite their scarcity in training data. The authors propose MONICA (Medical OpeN-source Long-tailed ClassifCation), a comprehensive benchmarking framework that implements over 30 long-tailed learning methodologies across 12 medical datasets spanning 6 clinical domains (Dermatology, Ophthalmology, Radiology, Pathology, Hematology, Histology, and Gastroenterology). Their work provides a unified codebase with modular architecture supporting various resampling, information augmentation, and module improvement techniques, enabling standardized evaluation of these methods under consistent experimental settings. The results demonstrate that certain techniques like GCL and DisAlign effectively calibrate classifier weight norms and improve performance across head, medium, and tail classes, while also enhancing out-of-distribution detection capabilities. The authors provide valuable insights on methodological trade-offs and practical considerations for implementing long-tailed learning in medical contexts.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The comprehensive nature of this benchmark covering 6 medical domains and 12 datasets with varying imbalance ratios represents a significant contribution to the medical imaging community, addressing a critical need for standardized evaluation.\n- The well-structured, modular codebase implementing over 30 methods provides immediate practical utility for researchers working on long-tailed medical image classification problems.\n- The detailed analysis of weight norm calibration across head/medium/tail classes (Figure 2) offers valuable insights into how different methods mitigate class imbalance.\n- The demonstration of improved OOD detection capabilities through long-tailed methods (Figure 3) reveals an important secondary benefit that enhances model reliability in clinical settings.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper lacks explicit connection between technical performance improvements and clinical impact. Without demonstrating how these methods affect diagnostic accuracy or patient outcomes, the medical relevance remains theoretical.\n- The evaluation primarily focuses on standard machine learning metrics (accuracy, AUROC) without incorporating clinically meaningful metrics that would better establish the value for medical practitioners.\n- The benchmarking is conducted on publicly available datasets that may not fully represent the complexity and variability of real-world clinical data, raising questions about clinical generalizability.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The clear categorization of methods into resampling, information augmentation, and module improvement provides an intuitive framework for understanding the landscape of long-tailed learning techniques.\n- The detailed documentation of dataset statistics, partition schemes, and implementation details enhances transparency and facilitates adoption by other researchers.\n- The analysis of training stability (Figure 4) provides practical guidance for model checkpoint selection in real-world applications.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The figures would benefit from more detailed captions explaining the clinical significance of the results, particularly for non-expert readers in medical fields.\n- The paper could better articulate how MONICA compares with existing benchmarks like MedMNIST or other domain-specific evaluation frameworks.\n- Some sections contain excessive detail about implementation nuances that might be better suited for supplementary materials rather than the main text.\n\n## 3. Summary of Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses an important problem in medical imaging where rare conditions with limited training samples must be accurately identified. The lack of standardized benchmarks has previously hindered progress in this area, making this contribution highly significant for the community. However, the paper could strengthen its significance by more explicitly connecting technical improvements to potential clinical impact.\n\n**Innovation:** While MONICA itself is primarily a benchmarking framework rather than a novel method, the systematic evaluation across diverse medical domains and the insights derived from this comprehensive comparison represent valuable innovation. The identification of specific techniques that improve both classification performance and OOD detection offers new perspectives on long-tailed learning in medical contexts.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is extensive across multiple datasets, methods, and metrics, demonstrating thoroughness. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by including more clinically relevant metrics and by conducting statistical significance testing across the results to confirm the reliability of the observed performance differences.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The work excels in reproducibility with a well-structured codebase, detailed documentation of datasets and partition schemes, and clear methodology descriptions. The modular design facilitates adaptation to new datasets and methods, and the planned GitHub release will further enhance reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision (Reject/Resubmit)**\n\nWhile MONICA represents a valuable contribution to the medical imaging community with its comprehensive benchmarking framework and well-structured codebase, the paper requires significant revisions before it can be accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging. The most critical issues are the insufficient connection between technical results and clinical relevance, and the lack of clinically meaningful metrics. The authors should substantially revise the paper to:\n\n1. Explicitly articulate the clinical impact of the technical improvements demonstrated\n2. Incorporate metrics that reflect diagnostic utility or patient outcomes where possible\n3. Strengthen the discussion of how MONICA advances medical practice rather than just methodology\n4. Provide more detailed analysis of the most promising techniques for specific medical domains\n\nThese revisions would better align the work with TMI's focus on medical imaging research that demonstrates clinical relevance and potential for improving healthcare outcomes. The authors have provided an excellent foundation with MONICA, but the manuscript needs to better emphasize the medical significance of their work to meet TMI's standards.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe authors tackle the problem of long‑tailed learning in medical image classification, where many clinical imaging collections are heavily imbalanced. To support transparent and reproducible research, they introduce MONICA (Medical Open‑source Long‑tailed Classification), an open‑source benchmark that assembles more than thirty algorithms from related fields and evaluates them on twelve long‑tailed medical datasets covering six clinical areas (e.g., dermoscopy, chest radiography). MONICA supplies a unified codebase, standardized training and testing pipelines, and detailed analyses of individual methodological components. The paper reports empirical results for every incorporated method on the chosen datasets, providing a broad reference for performance comparison. The main contribution is the delivery of a publicly available, well‑organized platform that consolidates state‑of‑the‑art long‑tailed learning approaches for medical imaging.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n* **Significance:** Imbalanced class distributions are common in clinical imaging; a shared benchmark has the potential to speed up method development and to promote fair comparisons across the community.  \n* **Innovation:** The novelty lies primarily in the engineering effort of gathering a large suite of methods and datasets rather than in proposing new algorithms. Although incremental, this contribution addresses a clear need.  \n* **Evaluation:** The manuscript presents extensive performance results (Tables 1‑5, Figures 1‑4) but omits several essential details, such as the split ratios used for each dataset, the exact evaluation metrics, and any statistical significance testing.  \n* **Reproducibility:** A public GitHub repository is announced, yet the paper does not include the repository URL, version information, environment specifications, or random‑seed/hardware settings that are necessary for exact replication.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n1. **Dataset splits:** The train/validation/test ratios for the twelve datasets are not disclosed (see Fig. 1), which hampers reproducibility.  \n2. **Hyper‑parameters:** Settings such as learning rate, batch size, optimizer, and number of epochs for the 30+ methods are missing, making it impossible to reproduce the experiments.  \n3. **Performance tables:** Tables 1‑5 lack captions, clear column headings, and confidence intervals; without statistical testing it is unclear whether observed differences are meaningful.  \n4. **Epoch‑selection analysis:** Figure 4 displays a discrepancy between the epoch chosen on validation and the best test epoch, yet the criterion used for validation‑based selection (e.g., early‑stopping threshold) is not described.  \n5. **OOD detection experiments:** Figure 3 reports out‑of‑distribution detection results without specifying which OOD datasets were used, the metrics applied, or how these experiments were integrated with the long‑tailed methods.  \n6. **Weight‑norm trends:** Figure 2 shows weight‑norm evolution only for the ISIC‑2019‑LT dataset; it remains unclear whether similar patterns appear in the other domains.  \n7. **Method taxonomy:** The paper does not present a rationale for the inclusion or exclusion of the 30+ algorithms, nor does it discuss possible bias arising from heterogeneous dataset sources.  \n8. **Code release details:** The statement about releasing code omits a URL, licensing terms, and a DOI, leaving the reproducibility claim unsupported.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision** – The work has clear merit, but considerable improvements to methodological transparency, analysis, and reproducibility are needed before the manuscript can be accepted.",

The absence of statistical significance testing makes it uncertain whether the observed differences are meaningful.  \n4. **Epoch Selection:** Figure 4 highlights a mismatch between validation and test epochs, but the criterion for selecting epochs (e.g., early‑stopping policy) is not clarified.  \n5. **Out‑of‑Distribution (OOD) Detection:** Figure 3 presents OOD detection results without identifying the datasets, applied metrics, or integration procedure with long‑tailed methods.  \n6. **Weight‑Norm Analysis:** Figure 2 discusses weight‑norm behavior only for the ISIC‑2019‑LT dataset. It would be useful to know whether similar phenomena occur in the other domains.  \n7. **Algorithm Taxonomy:** The rationale for the inclusion and exclusion criteria among the 30+ algorithms is not discussed, raising questions about potential selection bias from heterogeneous dataset sources.  \n8. **Code Availability:** Although public release is mentioned, the absence of a repository URL, license information, and DOI undermines the reproducibility claim.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify table and figure annotations for readability.  \n- Explicitly report evaluation metrics and dataset split ratios.  \n- Provide environment specifications, software versions, and random‑seed settings.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe submission offers a well‑structured benchmark that addresses a significant gap in reproducible long‑tailed learning research for medical imaging. Its main strength lies in assembling and standardizing a wide range of existing algorithms under a unified framework. However, essential methodological details—including dataset splits, training configurations, and code information—are missing or incomplete, limiting transparency and validation. The study’s contribution is thus primarily infrastructural rather than algorithmic, and it would benefit from major revisions aimed at improving clarity, documentation, and reproducibility.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe article addresses challenges in personalized treatment within modern precision medicine, particularly in the context of medical image segmentation. The key issues it aims to solve include:\n\n1.\tPatient Variability: There is considerable variability among different patients, which complicates the segmentation of tumors and critical organs in medical images.\n2.\tLimited Annotated Data: Many existing segmentation algorithms rely on large amounts of annotated training data. However, personalized treatment often encounters a shortage of such data for individual patients, making it difficult to train models effectively.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the authors propose a new approach formulated as an in-context segmentation problem, leveraging the promptable segmentation mechanism of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Their method, named P2SAM (Part-aware Personalized Segment Anything Model), allows for seamless adaptation to new, out-of-distribution patients using only one-shot patient-specific data.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The manuscript is clearly expressed and presents the research in a logical and structured manner, although some sentences are lengthy and could benefit from simplification to enhance readability.\n2. The paper presents substantial qualitative results and includes experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating a considerable amount of work.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. Representation: The overall logic of the paper appears problematic to me. The title and introduction emphasize \"Precision Medicine,\" yet the writing primarily focuses on highlighting the general applicability of the proposed method. Numerous examples and results are presented from the natural image domain, while the content related to \"Precision Medicine\" is notably limited, which may cause confusion for readers.\n\n2. The motivation for the \"Part-aware Prompt Mechanism\" is unclear: what is the reasoning behind this approach, and how does it address challenges in medical tasks? The architecture diagram is also based on natural image applications, leaving it unclear how the proposed method tackles issues specific to precision medicine. Additionally, there is no discussion on how this approach handles different modalities in medical imaging, which the paper should address.\n\n3. Method: Several aspects require further clarification and enhancement. \n\n     a. Firstly, the decision to use only a single negative point per cluster raises concerns regarding its sufficiency. A more robust approach would involve utilizing multiple negative points to enhance model generalization.\n\n     b. Secondly, while the method is designed for patient-specific segmentation, it raises concerns about its application to multi-segmentation tasks. A discussion on how the part-aware prompt mechanism could adapt to scenarios involving multiple segmentations would improve the methodology's applicability.\n\n     c. Additionally, the manuscript relies on 2D segmentation, which requires numerous points for effective performance. This issue remains unaddressed, and the choice not to utilize native 3D models is not sufficiently justified. Given the advantages of 3D models in capturing spatial relationships and providing more comprehensive context in medical imaging, exploring their potential application in this study would strengthen the methodology.\n\n4. Experiments: Several areas require clarification and enhancement.\n\n     a. Firstly, it is unclear whether the number of clusters set for K-means is consistent across different datasets. A detailed explanation of how the clustering parameters are determined for each dataset would improve the robustness of the results and ensure comparability.\n\n     b. Secondly, the comparison methods lack the inclusion of the latest medical-related benchmarks. Integrating more recent studies or state-of-the-art approaches would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance. This would help contextualize the results within the current landscape of medical imaging segmentation research.\n\n5. The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Numerous improvements to SAM tailored for medical imaging have been proposed, yet many of them are omitted in this work’s comparative experiments. Furthermore, several segmentation baselines widely used in the medical domain are not referenced, which casts doubt on the demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Is the proposed method truly aimed at addressing \"Precision Medicine,\" as suggested in the title and introduction, or is it intended as a more general approach applicable to both natural image and medical imaging domains? These are fundamentally different focuses, and clarity on this point is essential.\n\n2. What is the motivation behind the proposed method, and how does it address some of the fundamental challenges in the medical imaging field, such as unclear lesion boundaries and significant variations across different imaging modalities? Clarity on how these issues are tackled is crucial.\n\n3. Since the method claims to address patient-specific segmentation, it must consider the significant variability in characteristics across different diseases, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and rectal cancer. How does the proposed method ensure effectiveness when dealing with patients suffering from various diseases with distinct features?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 1\n\n### Confidence: 5",

The authors also propose a similarity-based refinement to control the number of prompts found during step 1. Main experiments were conducted on the NSCLC and CVC-ClinicDB datasets where the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances. Further experiments were conducted to show the method's performance against tracking algorithms and on the one-shot segmentation task.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n2. The experiments are thorough, covering various important and related topics. \n3. The proposed refinement strategy on the number of prompts is conceptually easy and seems effective.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. Unclearness in writing: (a) The motivation for Table 3 is unclear. It overlaps with Table 1 and 2 and brings little additional information. (b) For the baseline methods: direct-transfer and fine-tune, looks like no prompts are provided during the evaluation stage. Can the authors verify this is true?\n2. The contribution on the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism is unclear. Although the authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the overall method, it is unclear if the improvements are from the part-based sampling strategy or merely because of having multiple prompts.\n3. (Minor) The application range of the method is limited to patients with multi-exams.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism, could the author compared to a modified version of PerSAM where instead of selecting \"two points with the highest and lowest confidence values\", the authors may select the top K and bot K' points where K and K' matches P^2SAM. In this way, the authors can demonstrate that points found by the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism are more effective. \n2. Since authors have shown better one-shot segmentation performance, I am curious to see if the authors can show their method's performance beyond patients with multi-exams. For example, for some medical segmentation datasets without patients with multi-exams, can the author randomly select one image-mask pair as the prior and test the model's performance on other pairs.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The work introduces a \"part-aware prompt mechanism\" that leverages one-shot, patient-specific data for segmentation without additional fine-tuning.

The work introduces a new prompt‑based mechanism and a distribution‑similarity retrieval procedure compatible with general promptable models (SAM, SAM 2). It squarely targets methodological innovation in image segmentation, not an application‑only study. Thus, the paper fits TMI’s methodological scope.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level – Medium‑High**  \nInnovation lies in formalizing *patient‑specific segmentation as an in‑context segmentation problem* and augmenting SAM with multi‑point, *part‑aware* prompts plus a *distribution‑similarity retrieval* criterion to select the number of parts automatically. These ideas extend prior PerSAM and Matcher works by introducing (i) a feature‑driven prompt generation process and (ii) a principled adaptation heuristic. While this builds on existing SAM foundations, it provides recognizable novelty and conceptual contribution at the method level — likely within TMI’s novelty threshold.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor – Moderate to Good**  \nExperiments cover multiple medical domains (CT lung, endoscopy) and compare P²SAM against strong baselines on both *in‑distribution* and *out‑of‑distribution* datasets, with ablation and cross‑domain extension to natural images. Implementation details, hyperparameters, and retrieval settings are extensive (Appendices B–C).  \nHowever:  \n- Reproducibility of one‑shot “prior” data setup could benefit from explicit configuration scripts or public code.  \n- Uncertainty analysis and statistical significance testing are absent.  \n- Although IRB aspects are likely met via public datasets, explicit ethical statements should be added.\n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation – Good but dense**  \nThe manuscript is technically detailed and readable for an imaging‑methodology audience. Nonetheless, figure readability (visual scale/labels), equation typesetting, and excess references lead to occasional clutter. Editorial tightening would aid flow.  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance – Partially addressed**  \nAuthors use public datasets (TCIA, Kvasir, CVC), promising code release on acceptance. Explicit mention of IRB exemption and patient anonymization should appear in the Methods.\n\n---\n\n## **Phase 2 : IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n### **1. Summary**\nThe paper presents *P²SAM*, a **training‑free, patient‑specific segmentation framework** leveraging the Segment‑Anything model’s promptable structure. Instead of fine‑tuning, P²SAM clusters reference‑image features into part‑level embeddings that guide multi‑point positive/negative prompts for a new patient image. A *distribution‑similarity retrieval* (using Wasserstein distance) then determines the optimal number of parts. Demonstrations on CT lung tumor and endoscopy polyp segmentation show performance gains of ≈ 8 % Dice over comparable methods, with cross‑domain validation on natural‑image few‑shot benchmarks.\n\n### **2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological innovation in prompt selection and adaptive part‑count retrieval.  \n- Sound integration with foundation models (SAM/SAM 2) without retraining.  \n- Comprehensive experiments, including ablations and extension to multiple domains.  \n- Addresses a clinically relevant scenario — *patient‑specific (one‑shot) segmentation* — under the precision‑medicine paradigm.  \n\n### **3. Weaknesses**\n- Improvements over PerSAM after domain adaptation are modest; novelty may appear incremental relative to other prompt‑selection strategies.  \n- Statistical validation of performance differences is missing.  \n- Ethical and data‑use compliance needs explicit statement.  \n- Paper length and figure density affect readability; discussion could better isolate clinical significance.  \n- Some domain‑adaptation steps are tangential and could be streamlined.  \n\n### **4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify novelty relative to Matcher and PerSAM.** Provide algorithmic and conceptual comparisons (e.g., computational cost, robustness) in a dedicated subsection.  \n2. **Statistical significance and uncertainty.** Report variance or confidence intervals for Dice/mIoU; possibly perform Wilcoxon or paired t‑tests on patient‑wise folds.  \n3. **Reproducibility.** Supply pseudocode for the retrieval process, specify seed control, and release a minimal code snapshot.  \n4. **Ethics statement.** Explicitly confirm datasets are public/anonymized and no new patient data or identifiable information were used.  \n5. **Discussion depth.** Expand on clinical feasibility—e.g., execution time per case and how one‑shot prior images would be collected in clinical pipelines.  \n\n### **5. Minor Comments**\n- Improve figure legends and resize multi‑panel figures for readability.  \n- Fix minor typographic errors (spacing, subscripts).  \n- Cite recent TMI works on adaptive or federated segmentation to situate within field.  \n- Reorder Appendix sections: AMI summary first, less critical visualizations last.  \n- Include a short limitations paragraph in the main text, not only the Appendix.  \n\n### **6. Overall Recommendation**\n**Major Revision** — The paper presents a valuable methodological contribution suitable for TMI, yet requires clearer articulation of novelty, stronger statistical evidence, and tighter presentation before acceptance. With these revisions, it could reach publishable quality.\n\n### **7. Confidence Level **\n**4 / 5 – High confidence.** I am familiar with SAM‑based segmentation and medical imaging adaptation. The assessment reflects domain understanding and TMI standards.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Verdict:**  \nP²SAM extends SAM to patient‑specific one‑shot segmentation with a novel part‑aware prompting framework. The study is methodologically relevant, technically sound, and potentially impactful for personalized imaging, but requires additional statistical rigor, explicit ethical compliance, and improved clarity prior to publication in *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper proposes P2SAM (Part-aware Personalized Segment Anything Model), a data-efficient segmentation method for patient-specific applications. The method addresses the challenge of adapting segmentation models to new patients using only one-shot prior data without model fine-tuning (Section 1). P2SAM introduces a part-aware prompt mechanism that clusters foreground features from reference images into multiple parts using k-means++ clustering (Equation 1, Section 3.2), then selects multiple-point prompts based on cosine similarity between part-level features and target image features (Equation 2). A distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach using Wasserstein distance determines the optimal number of parts for each case (Section 3.2, Figure 5). The method can be integrated into various promptable segmentation models like SAM and SAM 2. Experiments on two patient-specific segmentation tasks show improvements of +8.0% and +2.0% mean Dice score, with additional validation on natural image benchmarks achieving 95.7% mIoU on PerSeg (Tables 1-2, Table 4).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation lacks precision and clarity**\n  - Equation 1 uses the symbol \"◦\" for mask selection without formal definition, making the operation ambiguous for readers unfamiliar with this notation\n  - The clustering procedure in Section 3.2 mentions k-means++ but doesn't specify how the number of clusters n relates to the retrieval range, creating inconsistency between methodology and implementation\n  - The Wasserstein distance computation for distribution similarity (Section 3.2, Table 7) lacks mathematical formulation, making it difficult to reproduce the approach\n\n• **Experimental design contains methodological inconsistencies**\n  - Table 1 shows the \"Meta huge\" model achieves only 28.52% Dice score while fine-tuned versions reach 60%+, but no analysis explains this dramatic performance gap or validates the fairness of comparison\n  - The retrieval ranges in Tables 9-10 vary significantly across datasets and models without principled justification, suggesting ad-hoc hyperparameter tuning rather than systematic methodology\n  - Comparison with MedSAM in Table 3 uses human-provided box prompts during inference while P2SAM uses only first-visit ground truth, creating an unfair evaluation setup that undermines the claimed advantages\n\n• **Limited technical novelty and insufficient baseline coverage**\n  - The core contribution of using multiple prompts instead of single prompts is incremental, as acknowledged in Section 2 where SAM's original paper states \"ambiguity is much rarer with multiple prompts\"\n  - Missing comparisons with recent medical segmentation methods beyond MedSAM, particularly other SAM-based medical approaches mentioned in Section F but not evaluated\n  - The k-means++ clustering for part-level features (Section 3.2) is a standard technique without novel adaptation for medical imaging characteristics, limiting the technical contribution\n\n• **Evaluation methodology shows significant limitations**\n  - The patient-specific segmentation tasks only include 13 patients with multiple visits from 4D-Lung dataset (Section 4.1), which is insufficient for robust statistical validation of the claimed improvements\n  - Qualitative results in Figures 6-9 show cherry-picked examples without systematic analysis of failure cases or statistical significance testing of the quantitative improvements\n  - Cross-domain generalization claims are undermined by the large performance variations across datasets (Tables 1-2) without adequate analysis of when and why the method succeeds or fails\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and reproducibility**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definition for the mask selection operator \"◦\" in Equation 1 and specify the exact clustering algorithm parameters\n  - Add complete mathematical formulation for the Wasserstein distance computation used in the retrieval approach, including implementation details\n  - Establish principled criteria for determining retrieval ranges instead of the current ad-hoc approach shown in Tables 9-10\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation and fairness**\n  - Conduct systematic analysis explaining the performance gap between Meta and fine-tuned models, including statistical significance tests for all reported improvements\n  - Implement standardized comparison protocols ensuring all methods use equivalent information during inference, particularly for the MedSAM comparison\n  - Establish unified hyperparameter selection methodology across all datasets and provide sensitivity analysis for key parameters like the number of parts n\n\n• **Expand technical contributions and baseline coverage**\n  - Develop novel clustering or feature selection techniques specifically adapted for medical imaging characteristics rather than relying solely on standard k-means++\n  - Include comprehensive comparisons with recent SAM-based medical segmentation methods mentioned in the related work but omitted from experiments\n  - Provide deeper analysis of the relationship between prompt selection strategies and segmentation performance to establish clearer technical insights beyond the incremental multiple-prompt approach\n\n• **Improve evaluation comprehensiveness and statistical rigor**\n  - Expand the patient cohort for validation beyond the current 13 patients, and include power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes for statistical validation\n  - Implement systematic failure case analysis and provide statistical significance testing for all quantitative comparisons rather than relying primarily on qualitative examples\n  - Develop comprehensive analysis framework explaining performance variations across different medical imaging modalities and domains to better understand method limitations and applicability",

The core innovation lies in a part-aware prompt mechanism that selects multiple-point prompts based on part-level features of the one-shot data, combined with a distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach to determine the optimal number of part-level features. The authors demonstrate improvements in mean Dice scores across different patient-specific segmentation tasks and achieve a new state-of-the-art result on the personalized segmentation benchmark PerSeg. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for addressing the challenges of limited annotated data and high variability across patients is clearly articulated.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the part-aware prompt mechanism and distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach are innovative, the manuscript does not sufficiently distinguish itself from existing work on few-shot and in-context learning methods. Specifically, the authors should clarify how their approach differs from recent studies such as Matcher (Liu et al., 2023) and PerSAM (Zhang et al., 2023), which also address few-shot segmentation problems. The manuscript should provide a more detailed discussion of the strengths and weaknesses relative to these methods.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experiments are primarily conducted on two medical datasets and one natural image benchmark. While the datasets are relevant, the evaluation could be strengthened by including additional datasets that vary in terms of anatomy and imaging modalities. Furthermore, the authors should consider evaluating P2SAM on a wider range of segmentation tasks to better assess its generalizability and robustness.\n\n3. Comparisons: The baseline comparisons are comprehensive, but the manuscript could benefit from including more recent and relevant methods, such as the latest advancements in few-shot and personalized segmentation techniques. Additionally, the manuscript should provide a clear rationale for why certain methods were excluded from the comparison.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors state that the code will be released upon acceptance, but the manuscript lacks sufficient detail regarding the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters. Providing more explicit information on these aspects is crucial for ensuring reproducibility.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are quite cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions.\n   \n2. Notation Consistency: The notation for the forward operator is inconsistent throughout Section 2.1 and should be clarified.\n   \n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms, such as \"R=4,\" are used without definition, which can be confusing for readers.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7) should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical image segmentation: personalizing segmentation models to handle the variability across different patients with limited annotated data. The proposed P2SAM method, which incorporates a part-aware prompt mechanism and a distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach, is technically sound and shows promise in improving segmentation performance. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited in scope, focusing on specific datasets and tasks, which weakens the claims of generalizability. The reproducibility of the approach is also a concern due to the lack of detailed methodological descriptions. Overall, while the idea has merit, the current evidence does not fully meet the rigorous standards expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision.

        "text": "## PART-AWARE PERSONALIZED SEGMENT ANYTHING MODEL FOR PATIENT-SPECIFIC SEGMENTATION\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes P2SAM, a training-free, data-efficient method for patient-specific segmentation that adapts promptable segmentation models (SAM and SAM 2) to new patients using a single reference image-mask pair. The key idea is a part-aware prompt mechanism: cluster foreground features from the reference to obtain part-level prototypes, compute cosine similarity maps on the target image, and place multiple positive (and, for medical images, multiple negative) point prompts for the decoder. To mitigate prompt outliers and tune the number of parts, the authors introduce a retrieval strategy that selects the part count minimizing a distribution distance (Wasserstein) between the reference and predicted target foreground feature sets. The method achieves consistent gains across two medical tasks and shows generality on natural-image one-shot benchmarks.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe part-aware prompt mechanism is simple, training-free, and model-agnostic, improving upon single-point prompting (PerSAM) and patch-level prompting (Matcher).The distribution-similarity-based retrieval for selecting the number of parts addresses prompt outliers and adapts to case variability, with comparative analyses across multiple distance measures.Integration with both SAM and SAM 2, and applicability across medical and natural-image domains, underscore practical versatility.\n- Experimental rigor and validationEvaluations on two clinically motivated patient-specific tasks (NSCLC on 4D-Lung; polyps on CVC-ClinicDB) with different SAM backbones (Meta, LoRA, Full-Fine-Tune) provide a thorough look at deployment regimes.Competent ablations on part count, retrieval, similarity metrics, and model size, including comparison against PerSAM and Matcher, support the design choices.Extension to standard one-shot benchmarks (COCO-20i, FSS-1000, LVIS-92i) and PerSeg with consistent gains strengthens generality claims.\n- Clarity of presentationThe methodological pipeline is clearly structured (feature extraction, clustering, similarity maps, prompt selection, retrieval), with intuitive figures demonstrating ambiguity reduction and prompt placement.The paper separates core contributions (training-free prompting) from optional domain adaptation to SAM, aiding readers’ understanding of where gains originate.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a real and important pain point in precision medicine: robust, single-reference adaptation to new patients without fine-tuning.Provides a generally useful prompting principle for promptable segmentation models that can benefit both clinical and non-clinical applications.\n\n- The part-aware prompt mechanism is simple, training-free, and model-agnostic, improving upon single-point prompting (PerSAM) and patch-level prompting (Matcher).\n- The distribution-similarity-based retrieval for selecting the number of parts addresses prompt outliers and adapts to case variability, with comparative analyses across multiple distance measures.\n- Integration with both SAM and SAM 2, and applicability across medical and natural-image domains, underscore practical versatility.\n\n- Evaluations on two clinically motivated patient-specific tasks (NSCLC on 4D-Lung;

exact computation vs. approximation (e.g., exact OT, sliced Wasserstein, critic-based approximation) and computational complexity are unclear.The method operates on 2D slices for 3D CT; implications for volumetric consistency and 3D deployment (runtime and memory when retrieving across slices) are not discussed.Prompt selection takes the single argmax per part from noisy similarity maps; no smoothing, local non-maximum suppression, or spatial constraints are described to reduce spurious maxima.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesFairness of baselines: re-implementations of PANet and Matcher “sharing the same SAM encoder” may not reflect their intended training/backbone regimes and could disadvantage them; details of re-training or adaptation are limited.Comparisons omit some recent SAM-based medical one-shot or prompt-engineering methods (e.g., Med-PerSAM, CycleSAM, SAMIC) that specifically target medical or few-shot prompting.No statistical significance, variance, or per-patient variability analyses are reported; the small number of patients and visits in 4D-Lung calls for uncertainty quantification.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesOccasional formatting artifacts (e.g., P\"SAM vs P²SAM) and minor equation rendering issues impede precision in some places.The “Hungarian” and “Jensen–Shannon” variants in retrieval are described briefly; algorithmic details (e.g., clustering settings, matching cost, PC selection) are insufficient for reproduction.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited engagement with concurrent prompt selection/engineering pipelines that learn or regularize prompting, and with bounding-box-driven SAM 2 polyp pipelines (detection + SAM 2) which are strong in videos.A deeper connection to part-aware prototype literature in FSS beyond citing ECCV’20 would strengthen context.\n\n- The use of Wasserstein distance “following WGAN” for high-dimensional feature distributions is under-specified;

how many samples are used; and runtime scaling in n and image size.For medical images, using multiple negative prompts drawn from background features is reasonable given high background similarity across visits; however, the selection’s robustness to large anatomical or acquisition changes should be analyzed.The reliance on a single reference mask assumes clean annotations; sensitivity to mislabeled or coarse reference masks merits analysis.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentPatient-specific protocols are appropriate and clinically relevant: first visit/frame as reference is a realistic assumption. The improvements over PerSAM and Matcher are consistent, and ablations are helpful.The choice to fine-tune SAM on in-distribution sets and then test on out-of-distribution sets is appropriate; however, per-slice vs per-volume evaluation for 4D-Lung should be clarified, as should aggregation (per-visit/per-patient averaging).Runtime is not reported. Since retrieval requires evaluating multiple part counts and computing distances, end-to-end latency (encoder forward(s), decoder forward(s), clustering, distance computations) should be quantified.Statistical confidence (e.g., standard deviation across patients/visits/videos) and sensitivity to n’s search range would strengthen the claims.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Compared with PerSAM (single prompt) and Matcher (patch-level prompting), P2SAM’s part-aware prompting offers a principled middle ground that reduces ambiguity without a heavy external feature backbone; results substantiate this.CycleSAM (surgery) demonstrates multi-point prompt sampling with boundary negatives alongside feature adaptation and consistency constraints; while task/domain differ, discussing overlaps (e.g., multi-point selection, boundary negatives) and differences (no training in P2SAM, retrieval by distribution similarity) would improve context.Med-PerSAM (warping-based prompt generation) and SAMIC (learned spatial prompt network) present alternative ways to obtain reliable prompts in medical/few-shot settings; a discussion of relative pros/cons (training-free vs lightweight learned prompt networks/flow modules; robustness to large deformations; temporal modeling for video) would frame P2SAM’s niche more clearly.For polyp video, YOLO-SAM 2 highlights a detector+SAM 2 regime achieving strong results with only box annotations; acknowledging this complementary line and clarifying where P2SAM excels (e.g., when only one labeled mask at first frame is available and detectors are unavailable) would be valuable.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe approach is attractive for clinical adoption due to zero training and minimal annotation burden; it can be inserted into existing SAM-based workflows to reduce ambiguity and improve robustness.Risks include over-reliance on SAM encoders trained on natural images; domain adaptation helps but should be carefully validated across institutions. Misplaced prompts could propagate errors; human-in-the-loop safeguards might be helpful.Extension to 3D segmentation (full volumes) and to multi-lesion cases is a natural next step with potentially strong clinical impact; current limitations are acknowledged.\n\n- The core idea—using reference-part features to place multiple positive prompts on the target—aligns with SAM’s observation that ambiguity decreases with more prompts, and is technically sound and simple to implement.\n- The retrieval mechanism is sensible, but the choice and computation of Wasserstein distance over high-dimensional encoder embeddings require explicit specification: whether it is exact OT (and with what solver), sliced/approximate OT, or a critic-based approximation; how many samples are used; and runtime scaling in n and image size.\n- For medical images, using multiple negative prompts drawn from background features is reasonable given high background similarity across visits; however, the selection’s robustness to large anatomical or acquisition changes should be analyzed.\n- The reliance on a single reference mask assumes clean annotations; sensitivity to mislabeled or coarse reference masks merits analysis.\n\n- Patient-specific protocols are appropriate and clinically relevant: first visit/frame as reference is a realistic assumption.

Do you use exact OT with a ground metric (e.g., Euclidean), sliced Wasserstein, or a critic-based approximation? Please report solver details, sample sizes, runtime, and sensitivity to feature dimensionality.\n- What is the runtime of the entire method per target image under typical N and n ranges (encoder + decoder passes, clustering, similarity maps, and retrieval)? How does it scale with image resolution and the number of candidate part counts?\n- For 4D-Lung, are metrics computed per-slice or per-volume and then averaged per-visit/patient? Please clarify aggregation protocol and provide per-patient variance/standard deviation.\n- How robust is P2SAM to noisy or partially incorrect reference masks? Have you tested robustness to synthetic perturbations on the reference mask or to inter-observer variability?\n- For negative prompt selection in medical data, do you also cluster background features into parts, or do you sample multiple argmin points from similarity maps? A precise description would help reproducibility.\n- Could you provide additional comparisons to recent medical SAM-based prompting approaches (e.g., Med-PerSAM, CycleSAM, SAMIC) and discuss trade-offs (training-free vs lightweight adaptation, robustness to large deformations, videos)?\n- How is the range of candidate part counts N chosen in practice, and what is the empirical distribution of the selected n across datasets? Is there a strong prior that could reduce the retrieval search space?\n- Do you apply any spatial constraints (e.g., local non-maximum suppression, morphological filtering) when selecting the highest-similarity points per part to avoid spurious peaks? If not, did you observe failure modes, and could simple smoothing further improve stability?\n- For 3D CT, have you considered 3D feature clustering and volumetric prompt selection (e.g., multiple points per slice with temporal/3D consistency)? If attempted, what were the practical barriers?\n- For fairness, how were PANet and Matcher adapted to use SAM encoders, and were they retrained appropriately? Could you provide code/configurations and report their variances?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper presents a practical and generally useful prompting approach that improves training-free adaptation of SAM-like models to patient-specific medical segmentation with only one reference mask. The part-aware prompting is a clear, simple idea that reduces SAM’s ambiguity, and the retrieval mechanism adds robustness across cases. The experimental results are convincing across two clinical tasks and standard few-shot benchmarks, with thorough ablations. The primary areas to strengthen before a top-tier venue are methodological clarity around the retrieval distance (implementation and efficiency), additional comparisons to recent SAM-based medical prompting methods, and reporting of runtime and statistical variability. Addressing these points would significantly bolster the paper’s rigor and reproducibility while preserving its appealing simplicity and broad applicability.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces **P2SAM**, a training-free, data-efficient framework for patient-specific segmentation that adapts large promptable segmentation models (SAM and SAM 2) using only one annotated reference image. The method employs a *part-aware prompting mechanism* that clusters reference features into part-level prototypes, generates similarity maps on target images, and selects multiple positive and negative point prompts. A retrieval step determines the optimal number of parts by minimizing the Wasserstein distance between reference and predicted foreground features.

        "text": "# IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging Review Report\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThe manuscript addresses a critical challenge in precision medicine: patient-specific segmentation that must contend with significant inter-patient variability while operating with extremely limited annotated data per patient. The authors propose P²SAM (Part-aware Personalized Segment Anything Model), a novel data-efficient segmentation framework that leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) architecture without requiring any model fine-tuning. The core innovation lies in a part-aware prompt mechanism that strategically selects multiple-point prompts based on part-level features extracted from one-shot patient-specific prior data, combined with a distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach to determine the optimal number of part-level features for each case. The method demonstrates significant improvements over existing approaches, achieving +8.0% and +2.0% mean Dice score improvements in two patient-specific segmentation tasks (NSCLC in radiation therapy and polyp segmentation in endoscopy videos), and establishing a new state-of-the-art result of 95.7% mIoU on the PerSeg benchmark. The approach exhibits impressive generality across medical and natural image domains while requiring only minimal patient-specific input.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n1. **Lack of clear differentiation from Matcher**: While the paper positions P²SAM as superior to Matcher (Liu et al., 2023), the fundamental distinction between part-level features versus patch-level features is not sufficiently explained. The manuscript should provide a more detailed analysis of why part-level clustering produces more meaningful prompts than patch-level approaches, particularly with visual examples showing the qualitative differences between prompt selections.\n\n2. **Insufficient clinical validation**: Although the method demonstrates strong quantitative results, the paper lacks input from clinical experts regarding the practical utility and clinical relevance of the improvements. A brief discussion with radiologists or clinicians about whether the observed Dice score improvements translate to meaningful clinical impact would strengthen the paper's medical significance.\n\n3. **Incomplete explanation of distribution similarity**: The paper states that \"tumors and normal organs manifest in distinct distributions within medical imaging technologies\" but doesn't sufficiently explain how the Wasserstein distance measurement specifically relates to medical imaging characteristics. More domain-specific justification for using this metric in the medical context would strengthen the methodological foundation.\n\n4. **Ambiguous performance claims**: The abstract states that P²SAM \"improves the performance by +8.0% and +2.0% mean Dice score\" without specifying the baseline. The paper should clarify whether these improvements are relative to the direct-transfer baseline or other specific methods.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n1. **Figure improvements**: Several figures (particularly Figure 3) could benefit from more explicit annotations to better illustrate the relationship between part-level features and selected prompts. Additional visual examples showing the clustering process in medical images would enhance understanding.\n\n2. **Computational complexity**: The paper would benefit from a brief discussion of the computational overhead introduced by the part-aware mechanism compared to single-prompt approaches, especially regarding clinical applicability.\n\n3. **Failure case analysis**: While Appendix E discusses limitations with multiple similar objects, a more comprehensive analysis of failure cases with specific medical examples would strengthen the paper's practical utility assessment.\n\n4. **Reproducibility details**: Although Appendix C provides some implementation details, adding specific information about hyperparameter sensitivity and recommended settings for different medical applications would improve reproducibility.\n\n5. **Terminology clarification**: The paper uses \"in-domain\" and \"out-of-domain\" terminology which could be more precisely defined in the medical imaging context to avoid confusion with standard machine learning usage.\n\n## 3. Evaluation along TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance**: The paper addresses a clinically important problem in precision medicine where personalized segmentation is critical but limited by data scarcity. The ability to adapt to new patients with only one-shot prior data without fine-tuning has substantial potential for clinical implementation. However, the paper could better articulate the clinical impact of the observed performance improvements, potentially through expert consultation.\n\n**Innovation**: The part-aware prompt mechanism represents a meaningful advancement beyond existing prompt-based segmentation approaches. The integration of part-level feature clustering with distribution-similarity-based retrieval for optimal prompt selection is novel and well-motivated. The approach effectively addresses the ambiguity problem in promptable segmentation models, particularly for medical applications where single-point prompts often fail.\n\n**Evaluation**: The experimental evaluation is generally strong, covering multiple medical datasets (4D-Lung, CVC-ClinicDB) and natural image benchmarks (PerSeg, COCO-20). The comparison against multiple baselines (PerSAM, Matcher, direct-transfer) is appropriate. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by more comprehensive failure case analysis and clinical validation. The ablation studies provide good insights into design choices.\n\n**Reproducibility**: The paper provides detailed methodological descriptions and references to implementation details in the appendix. The authors promise code release upon acceptance. However, some specifics about the retrieval range determination and optimal parameter settings for different medical applications would enhance reproducibility. The experimental setup is well-described, though some hyperparameter choices could be better justified.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision**\n\nThe paper presents a promising and well-structured approach to patient-specific segmentation with significant methodological contributions. However, several major issues need addressing before publication. The paper would benefit from a clearer explanation of how the part-aware mechanism fundamentally differs from existing approaches, particularly Matcher, and why this difference matters in the medical context. More detailed clinical validation and discussion of the practical impact of the improvements would strengthen the medical significance. The ambiguous performance claims need clarification, and the methodological foundation for the distribution similarity approach requires better medical domain-specific justification.\n\nWith these revisions, the paper has strong potential for publication in TMI as it addresses an important clinical challenge with an innovative, data-efficient solution that demonstrates impressive results across multiple domains. The authors have demonstrated a thorough understanding of the field and provided comprehensive experimental validation, but the clinical relevance and methodological justification need strengthening to meet TMI's high standards.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles patient‑specific image segmentation in the face of large inter‑patient variability and a scarcity of annotated images. The authors cast the problem as an in‑context segmentation task that relies on a single image‑mask pair from a new patient as a prior. Their pipeline extracts part‑level features from this prior image, clusters them, and then selects a set of positive and negative point prompts based on similarity to the target image. A distribution‑similarity retrieval step is used to decide how many parts should be generated for each case. The selected prompts are supplied to a promptable segmentation backbone (SAM or SAM 2) without any explicit fine‑tuning. Experiments on several medical datasets (lung tumour and colon polyp) as well as standard one‑shot benchmarks report higher Dice and IoU scores than the baselines. The central claim is that a part‑aware prompting scheme together with an optimal‑part retrieval strategy yields data‑efficient, patient‑adapted segmentation.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Relevance:** The goal of achieving accurate patient‑specific segmentation with minimal annotation is clearly important for precision medicine and could, in principle, reduce the burden on clinicians.  \n- **Novelty:** Introducing part‑aware prompts (i.e., clustering foreground features into multiple prototypes) and using a Wasserstein‑based criterion to choose the number of parts represents a fresh angle on prompt engineering for SAM‑type models. Nonetheless, the manuscript does not convincingly explain why clustering at the part level should outperform simpler patch‑level prompting schemes.  \n- **Experimental validation:** The authors evaluate four medical datasets (two in‑distribution, two out‑of‑distribution) and four natural‑image one‑shot benchmarks, reporting mean Dice or IoU improvements. Important details are missing, however: no statistical significance tests or confidence intervals are provided, and the exact patient‑wise train/validation/test splits are not described. Consequently the robustness of the reported gains cannot be verified. Runtime and memory implications of the added clustering and retrieval stages are also absent.  \n- **Reproducibility:** While the authors promise to release code after acceptance, several implementation specifics are omitted from the paper: how the number of clusters (**k**) is chosen, the initialization scheme for k‑means++, parameters governing the Wasserstein computation, and the hyper‑parameters of the retrieval algorithm. Moreover, the claim of “no fine‑tuning” appears at odds with the fine‑tuning experiments described in Section 4.1, which raises a consistency issue.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n1. **Inconsistent fine‑tuning claim** – The abstract asserts that the method works “without any model fine‑tuning,” yet Section 4.1 explicitly states that SAM was fine‑tuned on the NSCLC‑Radiomics and Kvasir‑SEG datasets before testing on out‑of‑distribution data. The authors need to clarify whether the proposed pipeline truly operates in a zero‑shot regime after this adaptation. *(Section 4.1, Table 1/2)*  \n\n2. **Clustering methodology under‑described** – The text mentions the use of k‑means++, but it does not disclose how the number of parts *n* is determined, what initialization strategy is employed, the stopping criteria, or how empty clusters are handled. These choices can materially affect performance and are essential for reproducibility. *(Fig. 3, Section 3.2)*  \n\n3. **Details of the retrieval step missing** – The Wasserstein distance between foreground feature distributions is introduced (Fig. 5), yet the manuscript omits critical information such as the dimensionality reduction applied, the number of samples drawn from each distribution, and the exact formulation of the distance metric.  \n\n4. **Baseline comparability unclear** – Some baselines (e.g., Matcher, PerSAM) are evaluated using a fine‑tuned SAM backbone, whereas others (direct‑transfer) rely on the pretrained model. The paper does not state explicitly whether all baselines share identical backbone weights, which could bias the comparison. *(Table 1, Table 2)*  \n\n5. **Lack of statistical reporting** – All quantitative tables (Tables 1, 2, 4) present only mean Dice or mIoU values. No standard deviations, confidence intervals, or hypothesis‑testing results are offered, making it impossible to assess whether the observed improvements are statistically significant.  \n\n6. **Dataset split information absent** – The number of patients allocated to training, validation, and testing for the out‑of‑distribution datasets (4D‑Lung, CVC‑ClinicDB) is not disclosed, nor is the patient‑wise split strategy. Without this information, potential data leakage cannot be ruled out. *(Section 4.1)*  \n\n7. **Computational cost not quantified** – The additional clustering and retrieval components may introduce non‑trivial overhead, especially for 3‑D CT volumes. Yet the manuscript provides no runtime or memory benchmarks to substantiate the claim of efficiency.  \n\n8. **Ablation study limited** – Table 6 explores only the effect of varying the number of parts *n*. The contribution of the retrieval module (with vs. without) and the role of negative‑point prompts are not examined, leaving the importance of these components ambiguous.  \n\n9. **Qualitative results biased** – Figures 6‑9 display only successful segmentations. Including failure cases would help readers understand the method’s limitations and failure modes.  \n\n10. **Overstated generalisation claim** – The authors state that the approach can be integrated into “any promptable segmentation model,” but the experimental evidence is confined to SAM and SAM 2. No validation on alternative architectures (e.g., CLIP‑Seg, SegFormer) is presented.  \n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\nThe manuscript introduces an interesting idea but falls short on several crucial fronts: incomplete methodological description, insufficient statistical analysis, unclear experimental protocol, and a lack of evidence supporting its broader claims. Until these issues are addressed, the work does not meet the standards required for publication.",

Although extensively studied in image classification, there is a lack of prior work on SDG for rare event or image classification in imbalanced dataset. In the medical diagnosis and disease detection domain, where data is often limited and events of interest are rare, deep learning (DL) models frequently exhibit suboptimal performance, leading to poor generalization across datasets. In multi-center studies, disparate data sources, differences in scanners and imaging protocols introduce domain shifts that exacerbate variability in rare event characteristics. This paper addresses this challenge by first leveraging a pre-trained large vision model to rank classes based on their similarity to the rare event class, allowing focused handling of the most similar class, and then integrates domain-invariant knowledge on rare event with DL to accurately classify the rare event class. By carefully incorporating expert knowledge with data-driven DL, our technique effectively regularizes the model, enhancing robustness and performance even with limited data availability. We present a case study on seizure onset zone detection using fMRI data, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art vision transformers, large vision models, and knowledge-based systems, achieving an average F1 score of 90.2% while maintaining an overall F1 score of 85.0% across multi-center datasets.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe authors introduce an algorithm for generalizing to unknown domains using only training data from a single known domain, \"RareSaGE\", which proposes to integrate domain-invariant expert knowledge with neural networks for the problem of rare class classification. Their method achieves improved performance for this task compared to several neural network- and expert knowledge-based techniques.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper focuses on a lesser known, but still seemingly important problem which deserves attention. They test on a realistic dataset comprised of medical data sampled from real centers, demonstrating real life applicability.\n2. The method is seemingly fairly technically novel. The rarity quantification doesn't seem novel (they cite Li et al), but overall, the combination of expert knowledge (an old field) with modern neural network models is interesting and unusual.\n3. Improvements over the compared baselines are significant for all metrics (except maybe precision) (Table 1)\n4. The intuition behind the method is reasonable, and the formalism discussed does help with understanding this. The reasoning behind \"rationale for definition 3.1\" makes sense, i.e., explaining the challenges in working with rare classes with respect to class entropy.\n5. I think the four characterizations of a rare event make sense (not sure if these are novel or not?), although discrimination and significance may be a bit redundant.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n**Major:**\n1. **Generally limited experiments (don't even begin until page 9):** I would suggest moving many of the less-important dataset, algorithm and method details into the supplementary, and filling the missing space with more experiments, especially those considering ablation studies, failure cases for your method, computational analyses, and others. The biggest issues are as follows.\n    1. For a method defined in such generality, the experiments are quite limited: just a case study based on one fMRI datasets. This is a big negative, because it is unclear if the method could generalize to other problems, or if it was bespoke to (or developed specifically for) this case study. This hurts the paper's suitability for ICLR, as the larger impact on machine learning is not clear to me, which would require testing on other datasets/problem settings/etc.\n    2. Moreover, while the improvements over the compared baselines are significant for all metrics (except maybe precision) the comparison/baseline models may not be sufficient:\n        - I'm not an expert in domain generalization, but are the comparison models in Table 1 really proper baselines (maybe another reviewer can chime in)? Simple training or finetuning on one domain and testing on another domain (as well as the knowledge-based systems) doesn't seem like a strong, appropriate baseline. Are there better unknown domain generalization techniques which should have been tested?\n        - Alternatively, what about comparing to one-class-classification methods, i.e. OOD/anomaly-detection methods? This is also a large body of work which seems suitable. At the very least, why weren't these discussed in the related work?\n        - why wasn't AUC presented if sensitivity and precision were also presented? This would be a better general performance metric than accuracy for accounting for class imbalance.\n\t\n2. **Lack of ablation/hyperparameter sensitivity studies:**\n    1. this method has quite a few moving parts, which each could be brittle. The more of these moving parts that there are, the more ways that the method could fail when extended to new datasets/problems. It is important to consider how changing or removing one component would affect the performance, in order to judge how reliant to algorithm is on that component. However, the paper critically lacks any ablation/sensitivity studies for such hyperparameters/settings. I will discuss potential ablation studies which could be done, but I challenge the authors to think of more. Some examples:\n        1. On pg. 4, a rare class is defined by a 2-sigma distance from the mean class entropy. Why/how was 2 sigma chosen? This is seemingly an important parameter, yet you do no ablation/sensitivity studies on the effect of different values for this (number of sigmas used to define a rare class)\n        2. Algorithm 1 is quite complex, additionally with certain steps not quantitatively/explicitly defined.\n        3. The use of PCA on clip features may have limitations, as its linearity may be too much of a restriction. Why wasn't some form of nonlinear component/degrees-of-freedom analysis tested as well?\n        3. The form of the expert knowledge in the tested scenario (Eq. 6) is quite specific. Are there viable alternatives to this formulation that could have been tested on this dataset? Also, in general, what is the feasibility for converting expert knowledge into this format?\n\t\t\t\n**Minor:**\n1. More clear, technical method details are needed in the abstract and introduction to be clear what these contributions are. For example:\n    1. In the abstract: \"This paper addresses … even with limited data availability.\" This really lacks in explicit details on how the method actually works. how is this ranking done, specifically? is it via a novel algorithm? also, what does \"focused handling\" mean? and how is domain-invariant knowledge \"integrated\"? These questions could be gleaned from the main text of the paper, but a better level of detail could still be provided in the abstract with less vague wording.\n    2. Similarly in the introduction, more technical details are needed. Your repeatedly describe the \"integration\" of domain invariant expert knowledge with deep learning, but I'm unclear from reading this what this actually explicitly describes.\n2. Misleading claims/vague wording:\n    1. In the introduction, you say \"This concept is particularly crucial in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for medicine, where the aim is to accurately diagnose new patient cases across centers\". This is misleading. AI for medicine extends far beyond diagnosis, including tasks such as segmentation, registration, harmonization, etc… and that's just for images, not including AI for medicine beyond images.\n    2. \"In medical imaging, there are various factors …  acute disorders\" also in the introduction; what are the \"classes\" being described here? I'm not sure if this is really intra-class variability (at least since you don't explain what the classes are here), its really just various factors that can contribute to domain shift problems in medical datasets.\n    3. \"In the medical diagnosis and disease detection domain, where data is often limited … variability in rare event characteristics. \" in the abstract is phrased confusingly. in the first sentence, is performance poor on the data because of limited data, rare cases of interest, or both? Maybe say that the second sentence describes a problem which exacerbates the problem described in the first sentence.\n3. Other missing technical details:\n    1. how is feature overlap/resemblance (described in the first paragraph of Sec. 3.2 actually computed? cosine similarity of the feature vectors?\n    2. Algorithm 1 shouldn't really be labeled as an \"algorithm\" in my opinion, because many of the steps are not defined explicitly, and left up to interpretation. More details are needed.\n    3. They provided anonymous code link in Sec. 4.1 is broken. It would have been helpful to see how such a novel and relatively complex algorithm was implemented in practice.\n4. Writing/clarity issues: the paper suffers from issues in writing quality, including clarity and typos, discussed next. For example:\n    1. The paper can be a bit challenging to read, not because of technical details, but because redundant information is often provided (see for example, \"solution overview\" and \"solution details\" could certainly be shortened and combined in 3.2)\n    2. Many sentences are terse and relatively telegraphic. The paper is still understandable, but could have better flow and general writing.\n    3. There is a too-long run-on sentence in \"To improve SDG for rare events, leveraging expert knowledge such as clinical opinion on …, has immense potential\" in the introduction.\n5. Typos/formatting issues:\n    1. In the abstract: \"Although extensively studied in image classification, there is a lack of prior work on SDG for rare event or image classification in imbalanced dataset\"\n        1. also, this is phrased confusingly. maybe say extensively studied in classification of balanced datasets?  But is having an imbalanced dataset not just kind of a triviality?\n    2. also in abstract \"integrates domain-invariant knowledge on rare event\" another typo.\n    3. Also in the intro, page 2 \"with DL using pre-trained large vision model (LVM) \"\n    4. There seems to be an issue in how in-text citations are formatted: no spacing between them, not parenthetical, etc. Makes it a bit harder to read the paper.\n    5. Why are the equations written with such tiny text? They require zooming in just to read. I'm not sure if this formatting modification is allowed for ICLR.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Is \"single domain generalization\" a common term when describing your problem scenario? it sounds like it describes generalizing TO a single domain, not training on a single one and being able to generalize to unknown ones.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4",

While there are many SDG methods available, the authors claim that none have been specifically applied to rare cases in medical data. It appears that the authors are addressing a new problem.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nProblematic Settings\n\n1. While there are currently no methods addressing SDG in the context of limited data and rare diseases, this setting appears to combine elements of SDG with few-shot imbalanced classification. If a SDG method is sufficiently robust, it could potentially be integrated with existing imbalanced learning or rare disease fine-tuning techniques to effectively address this issue. However, the authors lack experiments to validate this point, which raises questions about the relevance of this particular setting in the field. The authors have the opportunity to tackle a significant challenge: how to integrate large vision models (LVMs) for rare disease classification, taking into account that rare diseases can vary in size, may be in-domain or out-of-domain, and may be either imbalanced or balanced, thereby providing a more comprehensive framework.\n\nLimited Discussions and Comparisons of Results\n\n2. The authors have not compared their approach with existing SDG and imbalanced learning methods, which diminishes the convincing nature of their experiments and calls into question their claim of being state-of-the-art (SOTA).\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease see my comments above\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 3",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to TMI:**  \n✅ The manuscript proposes *RareSaGe*, a methodological framework for *Single-Domain Generalization (SDG)* targeting *rare event detection in medical images*. Its focus on integrating discriminative expert knowledge with data-driven deep learning (DL) for improved generalization is methodological rather than purely application-oriented. The case study — seizure onset zone (SOZ) detection from fMRI — is used to validate the general method. This aligns with *IEEE TMI’s methodological scope* (imaging algorithms, integration of machine learning with imaging).  \n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level:**  \nThe paper identifies a gap in prior SDG literature: lack of techniques handling *rare class problems* (imbalanced and limited data). It defines a new theoretical framing (entropy-based rarity criterion) and integrates symbolic expert knowledge with DL to handle overlap classes. Methodological novelty lies in:  \n- an entropy-driven definition of “rare class,”  \n- algorithmic framework (RareSaGe) combining DL and expert knowledge via a cascading classifier design,  \n- demonstration of domain invariance and single-domain generalization without target data.  \nThis is *conceptually distinct* but somewhat incremental in its integration aspects (DL + knowledge-based models). The contribution would reach TMI’s novelty threshold if claims on generalizability and cross-center validation are well substantiated.  \n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor:**  \n- Mathematical formalization (entropy-based rarity, CRLB rationale) is solid, though some derivations could benefit from clearer connection to performance metrics.  \n- Experimental design includes cross-center (A↔B) and aggregated validations, with appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1).  \n- Reported F1 > 90% across domains, demonstrating robustness — yet statistical significance or uncertainty quantification beyond SDs is limited.  \n- Datasets are realistic (fMRI from pediatric/adult centers), IRB-approved, anonymized; however, generalizability beyond SOZ detection is not empirically shown.  \n- Reproducibility: code link provided, though anonymized (acceptable for review).  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation:**  \nGenerally clear and well organized. However:  \n- Long sentences and heavy use of inline references hinder readability.  \n- Figures and tables are appropriate but schematic (Fig. 1 could better indicate data flow and model interaction).  \n- Some grammatical errors and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., equation alignment).  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance:**  \n✔ Explicit IRB approval and anonymization are stated.  \n✔ Code and data (anonymized link) provided.  \nOverall compliance is adequate.  \n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe manuscript presents *RareSaGe*, a novel algorithm for detecting rare events in medical imaging under single-domain settings. It introduces an entropy-based quantification of rarity and integrates expert knowledge–derived symbolic features through a quadratic optimization classifier with deep learning classifiers that handle overlapping classes. Using resting-state fMRI data for seizure onset zone localization across two centers, the method demonstrates strong cross-center and aggregated performance, reportedly outperforming standard CNNs, Vision Transformers, and knowledge-only systems.\n\n**2. Strengths**  \n- Clear methodological focus on the *SDG + rare-event* intersection.  \n- Innovative fusion of domain knowledge with DL in a structured, theoretically supported framework.  \n- Empirical validation across institutions, with substantial improvement in F1 scores.  \n- Conceptual interpretability through propositional knowledge features, enhancing trust and explainability in clinical AI.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**  \n- Limited generalization evidence beyond a single clinical application (SOZ detection).  \n- Some theoretical constructs (entropy definition vs Fisher information) are insufficiently validated empirically.  \n- Absence of ablation study quantifying the contribution of each module (e.g., knowledge integration vs DL alone).  \n- Presentation occasionally dense; method flow and parameter choices (e.g., choice of tc = 0.9) need clearer justification.  \n- Comparisons to related hybrid or physics-informed learning techniques could be expanded.  \n\n**4. Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological clarity:** Please provide a detailed pseudocode or diagram clarifying how DL and knowledge modules interact at inference (currently only briefly described).  \n2. **Ablation analysis:** Quantify how much each component (entropy selection, overlap separation, knowledge QO machine) contributes to the final performance.  \n3. **Theoretical justification:** Validate the entropy–information relationship empirically (show correlation between class entropy and misclassification rate).  \n4. **Generalizability:** Discuss applicability beyond the fMRI task—would RareSaGe generalize to other modalities (CT, histopathology)?  \n5. **Statistical robustness:** Add confidence intervals or statistical tests comparing baseline vs proposed method.  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**  \n- Improve figure captions and ensure all acronyms (e.g., QO, RSN) are defined where first used.  \n- Check reference formatting for consistency (e.g., MICCAI volumes, doi spacing).  \n- Correct some grammar/typographical errors.  \n- Clarify whether the hybrid method was tuned using validation from the same domain only (to ensure proper SDG evaluation).  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation:**  \n**Major Revision** – The work demonstrates substantial methodological potential and solid experimental basis, but requires additional clarification, broader generalization evidence, and minor writing improvement to meet TMI publication standards.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4/5 (high confidence in assessment; moderate confidence in reproducibility of quantitative claims).\n\n---\n\n**Summary Statement:**  \n*RareSaGe* presents a promising framework linking expert knowledge with data-driven learning to address single-domain generalization for rare-event imaging.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses Single Domain Generalization (SDG) for rare event detection in medical imaging, focusing on seizure onset zone (SOZ) identification from fMRI data. The authors propose RareSaGe, which integrates domain-invariant expert knowledge with deep learning to handle challenges of limited data, class imbalance, and domain shifts. The method first uses CLIP to identify the \"overlap class\" most similar to the rare event class, then employs deep learning for overlap/non-overlap classification and knowledge-based quadratic optimization for rare/non-rare distinction. Expert knowledge is encoded as atomic propositions about anatomical brain regions and activation patterns. Evaluation on two-center datasets (pediatric and adult patients) demonstrates F1 scores of 90.2% for across-trial validation and 94.7% for aggregate-trial validation, outperforming state-of-the-art vision transformers and large vision models.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - Definition 3.1's entropy-based rarity criterion uses 2σ threshold but lacks theoretical justification (Section 3.1, Equations 1-3)\n  - The connection between Cramer-Rao Lower Bound theory and class entropy in Equation 4 is stated without rigorous derivation (Page 5)\n  - Algorithm 1 references \"significant change in validation accuracy\" in line 2 but this termination criterion is never formally defined or used (Page 6)\n\n• **Experimental design limitations and evaluation gaps**\n  - Limited dataset size with only two centers (52 and 31 patients) raises questions about generalizability claims (Section 4.1)\n  - No comparison with domain adaptation or multi-source domain generalization methods that the paper criticizes (Table 1)\n  - Cross-validation methodology unclear for aggregate trials - whether patient-level or image-level splits were used affects validity (Section 4.2)\n\n• **Methodological concerns regarding knowledge integration**\n  - Expert knowledge formula κSOZ in Equation 6 appears ad-hoc without validation of individual atomic propositions (Section 3.4.2)\n  - CLIP similarity threshold of 0.78 vs 0.74 for overlap class selection lacks sensitivity analysis (Section 3.4.3)\n  - Confidence threshold tc set to 0.9 without systematic optimization or ablation study (Section 3.4.3)\n\n• **Insufficient technical details and reproducibility issues**\n  - Missing hyperparameters and training details for baseline methods make comparison validity questionable (Table 1)\n  - SMOTE application for SOZ class balancing mentioned but parameters not specified (Section 3.4.2)\n  - No statistical significance testing reported despite claims of superior performance (Tables 1-2)\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen mathematical foundations and provide rigorous derivations**\n  - Provide theoretical justification for the 2σ threshold in Definition 3.1 through empirical analysis or literature support\n  - Include complete derivation linking Barron's entropy-Fischer information relationship to the CRLB argument\n  - Formalize the termination criterion in Algorithm 1 or remove the undefined validation accuracy condition\n\n• **Expand experimental evaluation and address dataset limitations**\n  - Include additional medical centers or synthetic domain shifts to strengthen generalizability claims beyond two-center validation\n  - Add quantitative comparisons with domain adaptation and multi-source methods using the same datasets\n  - Clarify cross-validation splits and ensure patient-level separation to avoid data leakage, particularly for aggregate trials\n\n• **Validate knowledge integration approach systematically**\n  - Conduct ablation studies on individual atomic propositions in Equation 6 to demonstrate their necessity and sufficiency\n  - Perform sensitivity analysis on CLIP similarity thresholds and provide principled selection criteria\n  - Optimize confidence threshold tc systematically through grid search or cross-validation rather than fixed selection\n\n• **Enhance technical documentation and statistical rigor**\n  - Provide complete hyperparameter specifications and training protocols for all baseline methods to ensure fair comparison\n  - Specify SMOTE parameters and justify synthetic sample generation strategy for the rare SOZ class\n  - Include statistical significance tests (e.g., McNemar's test, confidence intervals) to validate performance improvements over baselines",

It employs CLIP-based identification of an “overlap class,” followed by classification and knowledge-based optimization distinguishing rare from non-rare events.

The link between Cramer–Rao Lower Bound and class entropy is asserted without derivation, and Algorithm 1’s termination condition referencing “validation accuracy changes” is neither defined nor applied.  \n2. **Experimental design and generalizability** – Evaluation relies on data from only two centers, limiting evidence for generalization.

The method first uses CLIP-derived, class-agnostic embeddings to identify an “overlap” class most visually similar to the rare class and delegates that discrimination to a DL module, while separating the rare class from remaining non-overlap classes using an expert-knowledge SVM built on interpretable propositions. A case study on seizure onset zone (SOZ) detection from rs-fMRI independent components across two centers demonstrates substantial gains over fine-tuned ViTs, CLIP, and knowledge-only baselines, achieving F1 scores above 85% in across-center tests and 94.7% in aggregated multi-center validation.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe orchestration strategy that explicitly identifies the most confusable “overlap” class via class-agnostic CLIP embeddings and routes it to a DL classifier while handling the rare-vs-non-rare decision via a knowledge-based SVM is a thoughtful decomposition aligned with the data imbalance and feature-overlap realities of clinical rare-event settings.The class-wise entropy criterion for selecting among candidate models is a principled, classifier-agnostic heuristic and ties to a broader theoretical motivation about information scarcity in rare classes.The approach leverages interpretable, anatomically grounded propositions for SOZ (cluster count, gray/white/vascular overlap, spectral sparsity) that clinicians can audit and reason about.\n- Experimental rigor and validationAcross-center evaluation (train on Center A, test on Center B and vice versa) is the appropriate SDG protocol and more convincing than random splits.Aggregate 5-fold 3-repeat cross-center validation provides additional evidence that the approach learns domain-invariant cues when more data are available.The age-based cross-distribution test (children→adults) is a useful additional stress test for distribution shift.\n- Clarity of presentationThe overall pipeline, including the role of CLIP/PCA for overlap discovery, DL for noise vs non-noise, expert propositions, SMOTE, and the fusion rule, is explained at a high level with a clear narrative.The expert knowledge is made explicit in a concise logical form, aiding interpretability and reproducibility.\n- Significance of contributionsSDG for rare events in medical imaging is both under-explored and clinically important;

claims risk being over-stated without tighter assumptions or empirical validation on synthetic data.The overlap-class selection uses CLIP embeddings and PCA with cosine similarity, but sensitivity to design choices (K, number of PCs, distance metric, CLIP variant) is not analyzed; the reported similarity margins (e.g., 0.78 vs 0.74) appear small.The “machine orchestration” procedure selects models by minimum entropy computed on the training domain, which may bias selection; a validation protocol for model selection is not fully specified.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesMissing ablations on key components: CLIP-based overlap identification vs alternatives, the effect of the 0.9 confidence threshold, SMOTE on expert features, and the contribution of each proposition to generalization (across centers).Important hyperparameters are under-specified: K in the KNN-entropy, exact distance metric, number of PCA components, SVM kernel/C, CNN architecture/training details, and how class weights, early stopping, and threshold tc are chosen.Comparison to closely related hybrid pipelines (e.g., prior SOZ expert+DL methods from the same group) under the same across-center protocol is missing; this makes it harder to isolate the contribution of the new “overlap-first orchestration” beyond earlier two-stage DL+knowledge systems.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesInconsistencies in notation and logic: overlap class is described as “most similar to rare class” but later defined as c₀ = argmin(θᵢ) (minimum entropy), which does not directly operationalize similarity; this needs correction.Some metric reporting is unclear (F1 vs “Average F1” by class), and the abstract’s numbers do not perfectly align with Table 1 in phrasing.Algorithm 1’s “while” loop conditions (“Ψ not empty and significant change in validation accuracy”) are not tied to concrete stopping criteria in the experiments.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsThe SDG literature in medical imaging primarily focuses on segmentation; nonetheless, several single-source DG methods (e.g., causality-inspired augmentations, low-rank latent regularization) could be adapted to classification and should be discussed as conceptual baselines.Recent hybrid neural-symbolic integrations (e.g., SAIF-DL, NeurASP, DeepProbLog) and related rare-event orchestration frameworks (e.g., STORM) deserve a more explicit contrast with the present approach’s training-time vs. post-hoc fusion design, especially around rule uncertainty and domain invariance.\n\n- The theoretical link between the proposed class-wise entropy (KNN-density based) and Fisher information/CRLB is suggestive but not rigorous for the specific entropy definition used;

The fusion rule that allows a high-confidence SOZ label to override a DL noise label should reduce false negatives on the rare class, which is desirable clinically.The KNN-entropy is a plausible heuristic for model selection and rarity quantification, but reproducible specification requires: K, metric, feature normalization, PCA dimensionality, and tie-breaking rules. A sensitivity study is necessary to confirm robustness.The theoretical justification connecting entropy to Fisher information/CRLB is conceptually appealing but not guaranteed for the proposed class-wise entropy functional; consider attenuating the claim or adding a controlled synthetic study demonstrating the monotonic relation under your settings.The CLIP-based overlap discovery is an intuitive way to remain class-agnostic while capturing visual similarity. However, medical images (rs-fMRI IC maps) are far from CLIP’s pretraining distribution. Include evidence that CLIP embeddings yield stable inter-class similarity rankings across centers and are superior to alternatives (e.g., self-supervised features learned on source data, VGG- or ResNet-based features, or handcrafted features).\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentThe across-center results are compelling and well-aligned with SDG goals. The additional children→adults test strengthens the case for generalization under demographic shift.Please add ablations:With and without CLIP-based overlap step; vary overlap candidate to show the benefit of the overlap-first decomposition.Threshold analysis for the 0.9 confidence rule; plot SOZ sensitivity/precision vs threshold to help users set operating points.SMOTE on expert features vs class weighting or other imbalance remedies; assess leakage risks and ensure SMOTE is applied only within training folds.Per-proposition contribution across centers (e.g., drop one proposition at a time; report cross-center stability).Entropy-based model selection vs validation-accuracy selection; show that entropy is not just correlating with in-domain accuracy.Report full training details for reproducibility: CNN architecture, optimizer, epochs, augmentation, early stopping criterion, SVM kernel and C/γ, PCA components, K in KNN, distance metrics, and CLIP variant and preprocessing.Provide class-wise confusion matrices for across-center tests, particularly SOZ false negatives vs false positives, and error analysis of overlap errors (SOZ misrouted as noise).\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Compared to causality-inspired single-source DG augmentations (e.g., GIN+IPA), your approach addresses a different failure mode: extreme class imbalance and intentional use of domain-invariant clinical rules, rather than inducing invariance via augmentation. A short discussion clarifying this complementarity and whether your overlap-first orchestration could benefit from such augmentations would help.Latent low-rank approaches (e.g., LDDG) argue for compact class-dependent latents to improve cross-domain generalization. While primarily used in segmentation/classification on natural dermoscopy images, discuss whether adding such a structural constraint to your DL overlap classifier would further help in low-data clinical settings.Hybrid neural-symbolic training (e.g., SAIF-DL) injects rules into the loss; your design maintains separation and fuses at the decision stage. A short analysis of trade-offs (training-time constraints vs. post-hoc interpretability, handling of uncertain/contradictory rules) would contextualize your design choice.STORM-style entropy-based orchestration of modalities for rare events is conceptually close; articulating the differences (overlap-class discovery via class-agnostic embeddings, two-stage routing, and SOZ-specific propositions) will clarify your novelty.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe approach directly addresses a critical barrier to clinical deployment: robust rare-event detection across centers without accessing target-domain data. The interpretability of proposition-based features and the ability to audit model decisions are strong positives for clinical adoption.Potential risks: reliance on fixed expert rules may under-detect atypical SOZ manifestations or novel phenotypes; consider adding uncertainty measures or soft rule weighting to mitigate brittleness.The design is generalizable to other rare clinical findings (e.g., specific lesion subtypes) provided domain propositions can be articulated.

Can you provide an ablation or stability analysis across these choices?\n- What are the exact KNN-entropy hyperparameters (K, distance metric, feature scaling), and how were they selected? Do results significantly change with different K or metrics?\n- For the SVM-based expert classifier, which kernel and hyperparameters were used, and how were they tuned? Was SMOTE applied only on the training set within each fold to avoid leakage?\n- Can you clarify the inconsistency between selecting the overlap class by “most similar to rare class” vs “argmin entropy”? Which criterion was used in practice?\n- How was the 0.9 confidence threshold chosen for overriding DL noise labels? Can you provide ROC/PR curves showing the trade-off between SOZ sensitivity and false positives as the threshold varies?\n- Could you compare against your prior hybrid SOZ pipelines under the same across-center protocol to isolate the incremental gain from the current overlap-first orchestration?\n- Did you analyze the cross-center stability of individual expert propositions (e.g., distributions of pg, pw, pv across centers)? Which propositions contribute most to SDG performance?\n- How does the method perform under stronger scanner/protocol shifts (e.g., additional centers) or different preprocessing pipelines for ICA? Any insights on robustness to ICA variability?\n- What is the computational cost (training and inference time) for the full pipeline compared to DL-only baselines? Is the orchestration step (entropy calculations) a bottleneck?\n- Could causality-inspired or frequency-domain augmentations (single-source DG methods) improve the overlap DL classifier? If attempted, what were the outcomes?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper tackles an important and under-explored problem: single-domain generalization for rare event detection in clinical imaging. The proposed decomposition—finding an overlap class via class-agnostic embeddings, routing it to a DL classifier, and using interpretable expert propositions with an SVM for the rare-vs-non-rare decision—directly addresses the intertwined challenges of scarcity, class overlap, and domain shift. The across-center experiments and additional demographic-shift test are convincing and show large improvements over several strong DL baselines, and the aggregate validation suggests the method scales positively with data. However, several aspects require tightening before top-tier publication: clearer and more rigorous specification of the entropy machinery and overlap selection, ablations on core design choices (CLIP, KNN parameters, SMOTE, thresholding, contribution of propositions), and a direct comparison to closely related hybrid pipelines to isolate the novelty and gains of the proposed orchestration. The theoretical motivation around entropy and Fisher information is intriguing but currently too informal to carry weight; an empirical validation or a toned-down claim would improve credibility. With these additions, the paper would make a solid and practically impactful contribution to robust, interpretable rare-event detection under SDG constraints.",

        "text": "# Review Report for \"SINGLE DOMAIN GENERALIZATION FOR RARE EVENT DETECTION IN MEDICAL IMAGING\"\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis manuscript addresses the critical challenge of single domain generalization (SDG) for rare event detection in medical imaging, a problem that has been largely unexplored despite its significant clinical relevance. The authors identify that while SDG has been extensively studied for general image classification, existing approaches fail to handle the unique challenges of rare event detection in imbalanced medical datasets, where limited data availability and class overlap create substantial hurdles. The proposed RareSaGe framework introduces a novel approach that first leverages a pre-trained CLIP model to identify class similarities and isolate the most overlapping class with the rare event, then integrates domain-invariant expert knowledge with deep learning to effectively distinguish rare events across domains. The method is validated through a comprehensive case study on seizure onset zone (SOZ) detection in fMRI data from two independent medical centers, demonstrating significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art techniques with an average F1 score of 90.2% across cross-center validation while maintaining overall F1 scores above 85%. The work effectively demonstrates how carefully orchestrated integration of data-driven and knowledge-based approaches can overcome the limitations of existing methods for rare event detection in resource-constrained medical settings.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n1. **Lack of comprehensive comparison with existing SDG methods:** While the paper thoroughly compares with various DL architectures and knowledge-based systems, it lacks a detailed comparison with recent SDG-specific techniques (e.g., those mentioned in Section 2 like EPVT, CLIP the Gap). Given that the core contribution is a novel SDG approach for rare events, a more systematic comparison with SDG baselines would strengthen the paper's claims about novelty and effectiveness. The authors should include and discuss results from applying these methods to their rare event detection task.\n\n2. **Insufficient details on knowledge representation:** Section 3.4.2 describes the expert knowledge as logical propositions, but the implementation details of how these propositions are encoded and integrated into the QO machine are not sufficiently clear. The paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how the knowledge features are quantified, normalized, and processed before being fed into the SVM classifier. The relationship between the atomic propositions and the final feature vector needs clarification.\n\n3. **Limited discussion of failure cases and limitations:** The paper focuses primarily on successful outcomes without adequately addressing scenarios where the approach might fail or underperform. A more balanced analysis that includes qualitative examples of false negatives/positives, discussion of cases where the knowledge-DL integration breaks down, and limitations of the current implementation would provide readers with a more realistic understanding of the method's boundaries.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n1. **Unclear confidence threshold selection:** Section 3.4.3 mentions using a confidence threshold of 0.9 but doesn't explain how this value was determined or whether it was optimized. The authors should clarify the threshold selection process and potentially include an ablation study showing how performance varies with different threshold values.\n\n2. **Inconsistent terminology:** The paper sometimes refers to the knowledge-based component as \"EKE\" (Expert Knowledge Extractor) and other times as \"QO\" (Quadratic Optimization) machine. Standardizing the terminology would improve readability and conceptual clarity.\n\n3. **Limited justification for SVM selection:** While Section 3.4.2 mentions SVM as the QO machine, there's insufficient justification for why SVM was chosen over other classifiers for the knowledge-based component. A brief discussion of alternative classifiers considered and why SVM was ultimately selected would strengthen the methodological explanation.\n\n4. **Ambiguity in Figure 1:** The \"Label Predictor\" section of Figure 1 shows a mathematical expression (Σexp.Wk) that isn't clearly explained in the main text. The authors should either provide a clearer explanation of this component or simplify the figure to match the textual description.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a highly significant clinical challenge—rare event detection with limited data in medical imaging—a problem with substantial real-world implications for diagnostics and treatment planning. The focus on single domain generalization is particularly relevant given the practical constraints of multi-center data sharing in healthcare. The demonstrated application to seizure onset zone detection has direct clinical utility, making this work both theoretically sound and practically valuable.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper presents a novel integration of expert knowledge with deep learning specifically designed for rare event SDG, which has not been adequately addressed in prior literature. The entropy-based class ranking approach using CLIP features to identify overlap classes represents a creative solution to the data overlap challenge. However, the innovation would be stronger with more explicit differentiation from existing knowledge-DL integration approaches, particularly those mentioned in Section 2.\n\n**Evaluation:** The experimental design is generally robust, with two complementary validation approaches (across trial and aggregate trial) across two independent medical centers. The comprehensive comparison with multiple baselines provides strong evidence of the method's superiority. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by including more SDG-specific baselines and providing deeper error analysis to understand where and why the method succeeds or fails.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper demonstrates strong commitment to reproducibility with an anonymous code and data repository provided. The methodology is sufficiently detailed to allow replication, though some implementation specifics (particularly regarding the knowledge feature extraction) could be more precise. The inclusion of detailed hyperparameter settings in the supplementary material further enhances reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision**\n\nThe manuscript presents a valuable contribution to the field of medical imaging with a well-motivated approach to a significant clinical challenge. The integration of expert knowledge with deep learning for rare event detection in single domain settings is both timely and potentially impactful. However, the paper requires substantial revisions to adequately address the limitations in the comparative analysis, methodological description, and critical evaluation of failure cases. The requested revisions, particularly the more comprehensive comparison with SDG methods and clarification of knowledge representation, are essential to establish the novelty and practical utility of the proposed approach. With these revisions, the paper would be a strong candidate for publication in TMI. I recommend a major revision with the expectation that the authors will address all major concerns and provide sufficient details to enable proper evaluation of the method's contributions relative to the state of the art.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThe manuscript tackles single‑domain generalisation (SDG) for the detection of rare events in medical imaging—a setting in which only a handful of highly imbalanced samples are available from a single clinical centre. The authors focus on resting‑state fMRI recordings from two independent sites, comprising three classes: noise, normal resting‑state networks, and seizure‑onset‑zone (SOZ). The SOZ class accounts for fewer than 5 % of the total samples.  \n\nTheir proposed RareSaGe pipeline first employs a large, pretrained vision model to extract class‑agnostic representations and to locate the “overlap class”, i.e., the class whose embedding is most similar to that of the rare class. A deep‑learning classifier is then tasked with separating overlap from non‑overlap instances, while a knowledge‑driven quadratic‑optimisation module—built from expert‑derived anatomical and signal propositions—discriminates the rare class from the remaining non‑overlap samples.  \n\nAcross both cross‑centre and pooled‑validation experiments, the combined system attains high F1 scores (≈ 90 % for the SOZ class and > 85 % overall). The primary contribution is the seamless integration of domain‑invariant expert knowledge with deep learning, using class‑wise entropy to guide the selection of the most appropriate classifier for rare‑event detection when data are scarce.\n\n---\n\n**## General feedback**\n\n*Significance* – The work addresses an under‑explored aspect of SDG: recognising rare pathological events when only a single, highly imbalanced source is available. The SOZ detection scenario is clinically relevant and illustrates the problem well.\n\n*Innovation* – The authors introduce a three‑part strategy: (i) CLIP‑based ranking of class similarity, (ii) entropy‑guided choice between a deep‑learning model and a knowledge‑based optimiser, and (iii) explicit encoding of expert knowledge as logical propositions. While each element builds upon existing methods, their combination for rare‑event SDG is novel.\n\n*Evaluation* – The experimental section includes thorough cross‑centre comparisons against pretrained CNN/Vit models, CLIP fine‑tuning, and a purely knowledge‑based baseline. Reported improvements in F1 are impressive, yet the study would benefit from statistical significance testing, ablation of individual components, and validation on a third, completely unseen centre.\n\n*Reproducibility* – The authors state that code and data are publicly released and that hyper‑parameters are listed in § 4.2. Nevertheless, essential details—such as the precise 2‑D CNN architecture, training schedule, SMOTE parameters, the confidence‑threshold *t_c*, and random seeds—are missing from the main manuscript, which hampers full replication.\n\n---\n\n**## Specific comments / critiques**\n\n1. **Rare‑class definition (§ 3.1, Eqns 1‑3).**  \n   The criterion relies on class‑wise entropy, but the manuscript does not disclose the value of *K* (the number of nearest neighbours), the actual entropy values (θ) computed for each class, nor the σθ threshold employed to declare a class as rare. Providing these numbers would clarify the selection process.\n\n2. **Overlap‑class identification (§ 3.2).**  \n   Cosine similarity of CLIP embeddings (0.78 vs 0.74) is used to pick a single most‑similar class. The rationale for selecting only one class, rather than applying a similarity threshold or considering multiple candidates, is not discussed. Exploring a more robust selection strategy could strengthen the method.\n\n3. **Stopping condition in Algorithm 1.**  \n   The phrase “while Ψ is not empty and significant change in validation accuracy” is ambiguous. It would be helpful to define what constitutes a “significant change” (e.g., a specific Δaccuracy) and to report the number of iterations actually performed.\n\n4. **Knowledge‑based SVM (§ 3.4.2).**  \n   The SVM is trained on SMOTE‑augmented SOZ features, yet the manuscript does not present the SVM’s standalone performance nor the effect of the synthetic data. Including these results would illuminate the contribution of the knowledge module.\n\n5. **Presentation of Table 1.**  \n   The table mixes Train A/Test B and Train B/Test A results while reporting a single “Average F1‑score”. It is unclear whether this average is computed per centre or across pooled data, which makes it difficult to assess cross‑centre variability.\n\n6. **Variability reporting.**  \n   Standard deviations accompany the aggregated‑trial results in Table 2, but are absent from the across‑trial results in Table 1. Adding dispersion measures for Table 1 would allow readers to gauge the stability of the reported metrics.\n\n7. **Age‑shift experiment.**  \n   The manuscript mentions training on pediatric data and testing on adult data, yet no quantitative figures, confidence intervals, or statistical analyses are provided. Supplying these details would make the observation more compelling.\n\n8. **Aggregated‑trial validation (§ 4.2).**  \n   Combining data from both centres deviates from the strict SDG premise of training on a single source. A brief discussion of how this hybrid setting influences the interpretation of the observed improvements would be valuable.\n\n9. **Baseline comparisons.**  \n   The study does not benchmark against recent SDG approaches designed for imbalanced medical data, such as the contrastive SDG method of Hu et al. (2023) or entropy‑based sampling strategies (Li et al., 2019). Including such baselines would situate the contribution more clearly within the current literature.\n\n10. **Minor issues.**  \n    A number of typographical and formatting problems (broken citations, misplaced symbols) detract from readability. A careful proof‑read would improve the overall presentation.\n\n---\n\n**## Suggested decision**\n\n**Reject** – While the topic is important and the proposed integration is promising, the manuscript currently falls short of the standards required for publication. Addressing the concerns above—particularly those related to methodological transparency, statistical validation, and comprehensive baselines—will be essential before the work can be considered for acceptance.",

    "abstract": "Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Even though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates compared to existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. One impediment for their deployment is the difficulties with generalization to pathologies or population groups that are not well-represented in training sets. This has been noted in several studies, and fine-tuning on target populations to improve reconstruction has been suggested. However, current training approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose CUPID for high-quality PD-DL training, using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates the goodness of the output with a compressibility-based approach, while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show that CUPID achieves similar quality compared to well-established PD-DL training strategies that require raw k-space data access, while outperforming conventional compressed sensing (CS) and state-of-the-art generative methods. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved populations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this expensive imaging modality.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe article proposes a deep-learning reconstruction method without having access to multi-coil $k$-space data. For the full-column-rank forward operator $E_{\\Omega}$ and the under-sampled $k$-space $\\textbf{y}$, the authors assume access to $E_{\\Omega}^+ \\textbf{y}$ where $+$ denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse. Compared to having access to fully sampled $k$-space as in fully supervised reconstruction, or undersampled $k$-space as in self-supervised reconstruction, this assumption is less restrictive. The proposed method was shown to perform on par with PD-DL methods requiring $k$-space data at relatively low acceleration rates ($4\\times$).\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The data access assumption is less restrictive compared to fully- and self-supervised reconstruction methods, and the article focuses on a real-life problem, as raw k-space access is a known limitation in this field.\n2. The method is physics-based; thus, it is expected to be less prone to hallucinations compared to methods that do not utilize the forward operator.\n3. The method was tested in various settings, focusing on both retrospective and prospective undersampling.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The quantitative results table is missing the standard error of the mean, which is crucial for a fair comparison.\n2. It is incorrect to say that equispaced undersampling patterns were not explored in score-based models. In fact, the authors have already cited at least one article (\"Robust Compressed Sensing MRI with Deep Generative Priors\") that explored equispaced undersampling, discussing it not only in the appendix but also in the main text (e.g., Fig. 2, 9, 10). \n3. The generative method baseline is weak and outdated, given how rapidly state-of-the-art methods are advancing.  Several approaches published in the last 12 months can achieve better results. Including this particular method is fine, but labeling it as state-of-the-art is misleading.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Does the clinical PI reconstruction readily allow saving the complex-valued image without any research agreements, or does it only allow the magnitude image to be saved? I am asking because it is rare to see a DICOM dataset containing anything other than magnitude images.\n2. Regardless of whether ScoreMRI is state-of-the-art, its performance appears unexpectedly low. Is it possible that it was significantly under-trained? In our experience, these models require much longer training times compared to unrolled networks, which might explain why it underperforms even at $4\\times$.\n3. The choice of perturbations seems somewhat arbitrary. Could you elaborate on this choice? Learning the perturbations simultaneously with reinforcement learning could also be a potential direction for future work.\n4. In Figure $2$, loss function, the left hand side was written as $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}, \\mathbf{x_{PI}})$ but the $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{comp}}$ on the right hand side has $\\mathbf{x}^{(m)}$ rather than $\\mathbf{x}^{(k)}$. Is this intentional or a typo? \n5. Line $151-152$, while unrolled methods achieved top positions in reconstruction challenges three years ago, it is unknown if they remain the highest performers. To the best of my knowledge, no recent, fair comparison between state-of-the-art diffusion and unrolled methods has been published, including a reader study to compare their clinical effectiveness.\n\n**Minor comments** \n\n* The fastMRI knee matrix size is $320\\times 320$, not $320\\times 368$.

The key idea is through using random perturbations.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. I like the idea of using random image domain perturbations, sounds like a good way to capture pior distribution.\n2. I appreciate the authors for the experiments on the prospective undersampled MRI reconstruction, which is a very important experiment for all MRI reconstruction tasks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nOverall, there are a few weaknesses that concerns me:\n1. I didn't really buy the idea of this rural region raw-data access. why we need raw-data? its for the training purpose! we already have a great number of raw k-space data (from fastMRI, mridata.org and others), as long as we have a good model trained, the rural regions can just use it without any training. In the end of the day, all MRI scanner will sample raw k-space data, so the whole motivation doesn't sound solid to me. \nMeanwhile, from what i understand from your method, the input is CG-SENSE of undersampled MRI, is it realistic? the input quality is not really diagnoistic.\n\n2. The presentation is not very clear and the paper is not well-writtened, all the method section for your method is condensed to one *single* page with a figure (figure 2), i have to go back and forth to understand whats R, whats DF, and how you do the perturbations, thats supposed to be the main part of the paper.\n\n3. The score-MRI results look kinda weird to me, try to look at other generative models. It shouldn't be that bad.\n\n4. Figure 3, the result doesn't look good to me, over smoothing textures.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. how do your method compared to single-coil DL-based reconstruction.\n2. how sensitive is your method to different input?

The method is based on introducing random image-domain perturbations to model data variability. While the concept is interesting and experimentally supported, the manuscript’s overall clarity and presentation are limited, which hinders full understanding of the approach and its contributions.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Motivation and Practicality** – The core motivation regarding lack of raw-data access in rural areas is not convincing. Raw k-space data are primarily needed for training, and existing large public datasets (e.g., fastMRI, mridata.org) already enable model development. Once a model is pre-trained, it can be deployed without requiring local raw data. Moreover, all MRI scanners inherently collect raw k-space data, making the stated premise less compelling. Additionally, the assumed input (CG-SENSE reconstructions of undersampled data) may not correspond to realistic diagnostic-quality inputs.  \n2. **Method Presentation and Clarity** – The methods section is overly condensed (approximately one page plus Figure 2), making it difficult to follow key components such as the definitions of R, DF, and the perturbation procedure. The limited explanation forces the reader to repeatedly review earlier sections to piece together the approach.  \n3. **Quantitative and Qualitative Results** – The results labeled as “score-MRI” appear unexpectedly poor compared to those from other generative models. Similarly, Figure 3 demonstrates excessive smoothing and texture loss, which raises doubts about reconstruction fidelity.  \n4. **Comparative Evaluation** – It remains unclear how the proposed method performs relative to single-coil deep learning–based reconstructions. Further comparison and sensitivity analysis across different input types and scanner vendors would strengthen the evaluation.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The overall writing and organization could be improved for readability and consistency.  \n- Clarify all abbreviations and notation within the figures and text.  \n- Ensure figures are of diagnostic quality and sufficient resolution.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe proposed method demonstrates an interesting idea using random perturbations for MRI reconstruction from DICOM data, and the inclusion of prospective undersampling experiments is appreciated. However, the unclear motivation, limited methodological exposition, and suboptimal experimental results substantially weaken the manuscript. Addressing clarity issues and expanding experimental comparisons would be critical for improving its impact and credibility.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision**",

The title is misleading: claiming a \"physics-driven\" approach while dismissing the need for raw k-space data is contradictory. In MRI, k-space data represents the underlying physical imaging process.\n\n3. The reported results for the baseline method, scoreMRI, are questionable, with performance significantly below that in the original publication.\n\n4. The novelty and contribution of this work are limited. The author attempted to improve the image quality with the proposed loss term $l_{comp}+\\lambda l_{pif}$, where $l_{comp}$ is to suppress noise and $l_{pif}$ is to keep fidelity to the input.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis work proposes CUPID (Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity), a novel training method for physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) MRI reconstruction that operates without requiring raw k-space data access. The method addresses the limitation that current PD-DL approaches require raw MRI measurements, which are typically unavailable outside specialized research centers, particularly in rural and underserved areas. CUPID combines two loss terms: a compressibility-based term using reweighted ℓ1 norm on wavelet coefficients (Equation 8) and a parallel imaging fidelity term that ensures consistency through carefully designed perturbations (Equation 9). The approach can operate in both database training and zero-shot subject-specific modes using only routine clinical DICOM images. Experimental validation on fastMRI knee and brain datasets with retrospective R=4 undersampling and prospective R=9 brain acquisition demonstrates performance comparable to supervised and self-supervised methods while outperforming compressed sensing and generative approaches.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - The parallel imaging fidelity loss in Equation 9 lacks theoretical justification for why the expectation over perturbations should approximate true parallel imaging consistency, as no convergence analysis is provided\n  - The notation switches inconsistently between f(yΩ, EΩ; θ) in Section 2.2 and f(xPI, EΩ) in Section 3 without clear explanation (Page 5, line 226-227)\n  - The reweighted ℓ1 formulation in Equation 8 uses x(m) from \"mth reweighting step\" but the iterative reweighting procedure is not mathematically defined or described\n\n• **Limited experimental validation scope**\n  - Only uniform/equidistant undersampling patterns are evaluated (Section 4.1, line 294-295), which represents a narrow subset of clinical acceleration strategies and limits generalizability assessment\n  - The prospective validation uses only a single high-field 7T acquisition at R=9 (Section 4.1, lines 309-311), providing insufficient evidence for clinical translation across different field strengths and acceleration rates\n  - Comparison with generative methods is limited to ScoreMRI only (Table 1), missing evaluation against other state-of-the-art diffusion-based reconstruction approaches mentioned in Section 2.3\n\n• **Perturbation design lacks principled foundation**\n  - The choice of perturbations as \"randomly rotated and positioned letters, numbers, card suits\" (Page 5, lines 251-252) appears arbitrary without theoretical or empirical justification for why these specific shapes are optimal\n  - The fold-over constraint design is described only conceptually (Page 5, lines 249-250) without mathematical formulation or validation that perturbations truly satisfy parallel imaging resolvability\n  - The ablation study on perturbation number (Appendix B.1, Figure 7) shows only K∈{1,3,6,10} without exploring the convergence behavior or computational trade-offs systematically\n\n• **Insufficient analysis of clinical deployment constraints**\n  - The discussion of filtering operations in Section 4.6 (lines 491-500) acknowledges limitations with vendor processing but provides no quantitative assessment of robustness to these common clinical modifications\n  - The magnitude-only DICOM limitation (Section 4.6, lines 507-518) is mentioned as future work but represents a significant practical barrier that undermines the claimed accessibility for underserved areas\n  - No computational cost analysis is provided for the training procedure, which is crucial for assessing feasibility in resource-limited settings as claimed in the motivation\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that the expectation over perturbations in Equation 9 converges to a meaningful parallel imaging consistency measure, including convergence rates and required number of samples\n  - Standardize notation throughout the manuscript, clearly defining when and why the function signature changes from f(yΩ, EΩ; θ) to f(xPI, EΩ) with explicit parameter handling\n  - Formalize the iterative reweighting procedure for Equation 8 with algorithmic description, convergence criteria, and relationship to standard reweighted ℓ1 minimization\n\n• **Expand experimental validation comprehensively**\n  - Include evaluation on multiple undersampling patterns (random, variable density, radial) across different acceleration rates (R=2,3,6,8) to demonstrate broader clinical applicability beyond uniform patterns\n  - Conduct prospective validation across multiple field strengths (1.5T, 3T, 7T) and anatomical regions with varying acceleration rates to establish generalization capabilities for clinical deployment\n  - Compare against additional state-of-the-art generative reconstruction methods including recent diffusion models and score-based approaches beyond ScoreMRI\n\n• **Develop principled perturbation methodology**\n  - Establish theoretical criteria for perturbation design based on parallel imaging theory, providing mathematical conditions that ensure resolvability and optimal reconstruction performance\n  - Formalize the fold-over constraint mathematically with explicit conditions relating perturbation spatial frequency content to acceleration factor and coil sensitivity patterns\n  - Conduct systematic ablation studies exploring perturbation characteristics (shape complexity, intensity distribution, spatial frequency content) with convergence analysis for different K values\n\n• **Address practical deployment considerations quantitatively**\n  - Evaluate robustness to common vendor filtering operations through controlled experiments with simulated and real clinical processing pipelines, providing quantitative performance degradation analysis\n  - Implement and validate solutions for magnitude-only DICOM reconstruction including joint phase and coil sensitivity estimation within the CUPID framework\n  - Provide detailed computational cost analysis comparing training time, memory requirements, and hardware specifications needed for CUPID versus existing methods in resource-constrained environments",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity (CUPID), a novel approach to train Physics-driven Deep Learning (PD-DL) models for MRI reconstruction using only routinely available clinical images exported from MRI scanners. Unlike existing PD-DL methods that require raw k-space data, CUPID leverages compressibility and parallel imaging fidelity to achieve high-quality reconstructions. The authors demonstrate that CUPID performs comparably to supervised PD-DL and self-supervised learning methods that rely on raw k-space data, while also outperforming conventional compressed sensing and generative methods. The manuscript is well-written and clearly articulates the motivations and technical innovations of CUPID.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The introduction of CUPID as a method to train PD-DL models without raw k-space data is innovative and addresses a significant limitation of current PD-DL approaches. However, the manuscript should more explicitly position CUPID in relation to existing unsupervised and self-supervised learning methods that also aim to reduce the reliance on raw data. Additionally, the authors should clarify how CUPID's compressibility and parallel imaging fidelity losses differ from and improve upon previous methods.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation of CUPID is conducted on both retrospective and prospective undersampled datasets, which is commendable. However, the retrospective study primarily uses equidistant undersampling patterns, which may not fully represent the variability seen in clinical practice. Including more diverse undersampling patterns (e.g., Poisson disk sampling) would strengthen the evaluation. Moreover, the prospective study should ideally include more subjects and a wider range of anatomies to further validate the method's generalizability.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares CUPID with several established methods, including supervised PD-DL, self-supervised learning (SSDU), and generative models (ScoreMRI). However, the comparisons could be more extensive. For example, including other recent self-supervised methods that do not require raw data access (e.g., methods based on generative adversarial networks) would provide a more comprehensive assessment of CUPID's performance. Additionally, the authors should discuss why certain methods were excluded from the comparisons.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors state that the code will be released upon acceptance, which is positive. However, the manuscript lacks sufficient detail regarding the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters. Providing a more detailed description of these aspects is crucial for reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors should include a section outlining the data preprocessing steps and any normalization techniques applied to the DICOM images before feeding them into the CUPID framework.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figure Clarity: Figures 3 and 4 are somewhat cluttered. Reducing the number of representative slices and focusing on specific regions of interest (ROIs) would enhance readability and highlight the key differences between methods more effectively.\n\n2. Notation Consistency: The notation used for the forward operator (EΩ) is inconsistent at times. Clarifying this in the text and ensuring consistency would aid readers' understanding.\n\n3. Acronym Definitions: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\", \"CG-SENSE\") are used without definitions. Providing a glossary of acronyms or defining them upon first use would improve clarity.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical errors exist in the text (e.g., \"k-spacce\", \"undersampling maskes\"). Careful proofreading would eliminate these issues.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: training PD-DL models for MRI reconstruction without access to raw k-space data. The proposed CUPID method is technically innovative and shows promise in providing high-quality reconstructions using only clinical DICOM images. However, the evaluation could benefit from more diverse undersampling patterns and a broader range of anatomies. The reproducibility of the approach is also uncertain due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, while the idea has merit, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include a wider range of self-supervised methods, strengthen validation across diverse undersampling patterns and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

CUPID combines a compressibility-inspired, reweighted ℓ1 loss with a novel “parallel imaging fidelity” term enforced via carefully designed perturbations that are resolvable by parallel imaging, enabling both database training and zero-shot/subject-specific fine-tuning. Experiments on fastMRI knee/brain (retrospective R=4, equidistant) and a prospective 7T brain GRE acquisition (R=9, kx-only) show CUPID approaches supervised/self-supervised PD-DL performance and outperforms CS, CG-SENSE, and a diffusion baseline, while requiring no raw measurements during training.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntroduces a training paradigm for PD-DL reconstruction that operates purely from clinical reconstructed images, removing the long-standing requirement for raw k-space access in training.Uses a clever fidelity term based on perturbations designed to be resolvable by parallel imaging, stabilizing the compressibility-driven objective and preventing trivial solutions without raw-data fidelity.The reweighted-ℓ1 compressibility term is well-motivated (closer to ℓ0) and appropriately combined with a physics-informed fidelity, bridging compressibility-inspired unsupervised learning and PD-DL.\n- Experimental rigor and validationEvaluations span both database training and zero-shot/subject-specific settings, including a prospective accelerated 7T setup that closely mirrors the intended low-resource workflow.Ablations study the sensitivity to the trade-off λ and the number of perturbations K, offering insight into stability and practical hyperparameter ranges.Comparisons include supervised and self-supervised PD-DL baselines (with raw access) as well as CS, CG-SENSE, and a diffusion-model method that are raw-free at training.\n- Clarity of presentationThe core idea, loss formulation, and training pipeline are clearly depicted, with a helpful schematic explaining the role of perturbations and reweighting.The motivation regarding equitable access and the practical impediments of raw data is well articulated, with a cohesive narrative linking problem, method, and evaluation.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a critical translational barrier: the inability of non-academic sites to train/fine-tune PD-DL due to raw-data restrictions, potentially broadening access to high-quality accelerated MRI.Offers a pathway for site-specific adaptation (zero-shot fine-tuning) that could mitigate distribution shift issues and improve generalization to local populations.\n\n- Introduces a training paradigm for PD-DL reconstruction that operates purely from clinical reconstructed images, removing the long-standing requirement for raw k-space access in training.\n- Uses a clever fidelity term based on perturbations designed to be resolvable by parallel imaging, stabilizing the compressibility-driven objective and preventing trivial solutions without raw-data fidelity.\n- The reweighted-ℓ1 compressibility term is well-motivated (closer to ℓ0) and appropriately combined with a physics-informed fidelity, bridging compressibility-inspired unsupervised learning and PD-DL.\n\n- Evaluations span both database training and zero-shot/subject-specific settings, including a prospective accelerated 7T setup that closely mirrors the intended low-resource workflow.\n- Ablations study the sensitivity to the trade-off λ and the number of perturbations K, offering insight into stability and practical hyperparameter ranges.\n- Comparisons include supervised and self-supervised PD-DL baselines (with raw access) as well as CS, CG-SENSE, and a diffusion-model method that are raw-free at training.\n\n- The core idea, loss formulation, and training pipeline are clearly depicted, with a helpful schematic explaining the role of perturbations and reweighting.\n- The motivation regarding equitable access and the practical impediments of raw data is well articulated, with a cohesive narrative linking problem, method, and evaluation.\n\n- Addresses a critical translational barrier: the inability of non-academic sites to train/fine-tune PD-DL due to raw-data restrictions, potentially broadening access to high-quality accelerated MRI.\n- Offers a pathway for site-specific adaptation (zero-shot fine-tuning) that could mitigate distribution shift issues and improve generalization to local populations.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe method still requires accurate knowledge of the encoding operator EΩ (including coil sensitivities) at train/test time. In real DICOM-only scenarios, reliable access to coil maps is nontrivial and vendor-dependent; this practical bottleneck is only partially addressed.The fidelity term relies on hand-designed image-domain perturbations whose amplitude, frequency content, and spatial placement could affect convergence, stability, and potential bias; design guidance is limited.The approach assumes xPI ≈ (EΩ^H EΩ)^{-1} EΩ^H yΩ; vendor pipelines often apply filters, partial Fourier, coil compression, or proprietary post-processing that may violate this equivalence.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesRetrospective experiments use fastMRI-derived EΩ and simulate xPI via CG-SENSE; this does not fully represent the DICOM-only constraint (no demonstration of coil map estimation from only DICOM exports or separate vendor calibration DICOMs in the retrospective setting).Prospective results are qualitative only; no reader study or quantitative surrogate (e.g., repeated acquisitions, central k-space “reference,” or task-based evaluation) to substantiate claims at R=9.Limited sampling patterns (mostly 1D equidistant at R=4 and a single prospective kx-only R=9); generalization to random sampling, 2D sampling, non-Cartesian patterns, and higher R values is not assessed.Baseline tuning for diffusion/score-based methods appears limited (e.g., only ScoreMRI with hard DC), potentially underestimating performance relative to more recent MRI-tailored or LDM-based samplers.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesDetails for deriving EΩ from DICOM-only pipelines and reliably estimating coil sensitivities are not fully specified; reference [Krueger et al., 2023] does not address coil sensitivity estimation.The reweighting scheme for Lcomp lacks concrete hyperparameters (frequency of updating x^(m), choice of ε, the specific wavelet transform used in CUPID).The perturbation design is described qualitatively (“letters, numbers, suits”) without specifying amplitude ranges, energy relative to anatomy, or whether intensity normalization is applied.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsRecent unsupervised/posterior-sampling methods and latent diffusion approaches for MRI reconstruction (that may also operate without large raw-data training) are underrepresented in comparisons; e.g., more advanced diffusion samplers or latent adaptation methods.Closely related self-supervised work that incorporates perturbation consistency in the PI setting (though requiring raw data) could be discussed in more depth to clarify conceptual differences and the novelty of moving to DICOM-only training.\n\n- The method still requires accurate knowledge of the encoding operator EΩ (including coil sensitivities) at train/test time.

The motivation that f(xPI + p) − p ≈ f(xPI) when p is PI-resolvable aligns with how the DF block uses EΩ and the RHS EΩ^H yΩ, which can be approximated by EΩ^H EΩ xPI under the PI assumption.The assumption that EΩ^H yΩ = EΩ^H EΩ xPI critically depends on xPI being a true PI solution. In real scanner pipelines, deviations (e.g., filtering, partial Fourier, calibration mismatch) can break this equality. The paper briefly acknowledges filtering, but the stability of CUPID when the equality is only approximate should be investigated (e.g., controlled perturbations to emulate vendor post-processing).The perturbation strategy is original in this training context and leverages PI resolvability. However, the theoretical guarantee that trivial solutions are precluded is qualitative; a brief analysis of failure modes (e.g., p amplitude too small, excessive noise, or coil map errors) would strengthen soundness.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentRetrospective R=4 equidistant experiments are a good stress test for coherent aliasing; results show CUPID near supervised/SSDU and better than CS/CG-SENSE. That said, R=4 is relatively moderate, and PD-FS is more challenging—an expanded study at R≥6 and a broader set of sequences/organs would better characterize limits.Zero-shot experiments are relevant to the target use case and show that CUPID can approach ZS-SSDU without raw data. This is a compelling result.The prospective 7T case demonstrates practical feasibility at high R with nontrivial artifacts/noise in the vendor DICOM. However, the evaluation is qualitative only. Including a radiologist reader study, a noise/artifact scoring, or use of a partial-reference metric (e.g., low-frequency consistency) would substantiate claims.Ablations on λ and K are valuable. Further ablations on perturbation amplitude, type, and spatial distribution would guide practitioners and assess robustness to design choices.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Self-supervised SSDU (Yaman et al., 2019/2020) and its variants require raw k-space. CUPID is complementary by removing that requirement and learning from xPI; this is a distinctive contribution.Generative/diffusion methods (e.g., ScoreMRI; more recent LDM-based MRPD-like approaches) can use only images for prior learning but typically require raw measurements for data consistency at inference and are computationally heavy. CUPID avoids large-scale generative training and is scan-efficient, but still depends on EΩ at test time and leverages an unrolled PD-DL that is faster at inference.Recent unsupervised flow-matching or diffusion posterior methods (e.g., GTF2M, DiffINR) mostly rely on raw measurements at training or sampling; CUPID targets a different training constraint (no raw), so the positioning is appropriate. Including a more diverse set of non-raw training baselines (e.g., deep image prior, scan-specific INRs without raw) would better situate the method.Perturbation-consistency ideas have emerged in self-supervised PD-DL with raw access; CUPID’s move to DICOM-only training via a PI-compatible perturbation scheme is a clear novelty relative to those.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe paper addresses a real barrier to clinical dissemination: lack of raw access precluding site-specific PD-DL training. If adopted, CUPID could enable local fine-tuning to mitigate distribution shifts and thereby improve equity in MRI access and quality.Practical hurdles remain: the need for EΩ and coil maps; GPU availability for fine-tuning; and the variability of vendor pipelines. The discussion acknowledges some of these aspects and suggests possible mitigations (transfer learning, offsite compute). A deeper practical roadmap would enhance impact (e.g., recommended acquisition of calibration DICOMs, QA steps to verify EΩ consistency).\n\n- The CUPID objective L = Lcomp + λ Lpif is sensible: reweighted-ℓ1 encourages compressibility while the PI-fidelity term targets non-triviality by requiring the network to reproduce resolvable perturbations.

Can you detail the exact steps and data required to estimate S maps without raw k-space or ACS lines, and report robustness to map errors? The Krueger et al. reference appears unrelated to coil sensitivity estimation.\n- In retrospective experiments, were EΩ and coil maps derived from raw fastMRI data? If so, can you replicate training using only DICOM-like inputs plus a separate vendor-style calibration DICOM to better emulate the true constraint?\n- How sensitive is CUPID to vendor post-processing that violates xPI ≈ (E^H E)^{-1} E^H y (e.g., partial Fourier, zero-padding, denoising, intensity corrections)? Can you provide experiments where you intentionally apply such processing to test robustness?\n- What are the perturbation amplitude and spectral characteristics you recommend? Have you studied whether perturbations that are too strong or too weak affect convergence or induce biases/hallucinations in fine textures?\n- Can you quantify zero-shot fine-tuning time and memory footprint for typical 2D and 3D scans, and compare to ZS-SSDU and diffusion-based sampling in terms of wall-clock and compute?\n- Which wavelet transform and ε do you use for Lcomp in CUPID, how often do you update x^(m), and how many reweighting steps are performed? Please provide a sensitivity analysis on these hyperparameters.\n- Could you include an additional baseline with a recent latent diffusion approach adapted to MRI magnitudes (e.g., LDM + MRAdapter-style adaptation) or a deep image prior baseline to strengthen raw-free comparisons?\n- For the prospective 7T experiment, can you provide any quantitative surrogate (e.g., low-frequency error, noise index, or radiologist assessment) to support the qualitative gains at R=9?\n- Have you tested CUPID on random 1D, 2D Cartesian, or non-Cartesian sampling to assess generality of the perturbation strategy and training stability?\n- Do you foresee principled ways to automatically select perturbations (amplitude, locations) beyond the proposed reinforcement-learning idea—e.g., via sensitivity maps and g-factor predictions?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper tackles an important and practical barrier to deploying PD-DL MRI reconstruction in typical clinical environments: the need for raw k-space access during training. CUPID’s formulation—melding compressibility-driven unsupervised learning with a parallel imaging-consistent perturbation fidelity—is original and well-motivated, and the experimental evidence suggests that, in both database and zero-shot modes, the method attains performance comparable to strong PD-DL baselines while operating without raw data. The work is timely and potentially impactful for equitable MRI access. The primary limitations are practical and experimental: reliable access to EΩ in DICOM-only settings is not yet demonstrated end-to-end; robustness to vendor post-processing is only qualitatively discussed; and prospective validation lacks quantitative or reader-based assessment. Strengthening these aspects (clearer coil-map pipeline from DICOM-only, additional robustness studies, stronger baselines, and quantitative prospective evaluation) would considerably enhance the paper’s maturity. Overall, I view the core idea as significant and the results promising; with the suggested clarifications and added experiments, this work would be a strong candidate for a top-tier venue.",

The method introduces a reweighted ℓ1 compressibility loss combined with a “parallel imaging fidelity” term based on resolvable perturbations, enabling both database-level training and zero-shot fine-tuning. Experiments on fastMRI knee/brain datasets and a prospective 7T brain study indicate that CUPID approaches supervised and self-supervised PD-DL performance while surpassing compressed sensing and classical reconstructions. The paper is clearly written and technically motivated, addressing an important barrier to equitable clinical deployment of PD-DL methods.  \n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Dependence on accurate encoding models:** CUPID requires knowledge of the encoding operator and coil sensitivities at both training and inference. In true DICOM-only environments, obtaining reliable coil maps is vendor-specific and often infeasible. This limitation is acknowledged but not fully resolved.  \n2. **Design of perturbations:** The fidelity term relies on handcrafted image-domain perturbations; their magnitude and spatial frequency characteristics may influence convergence and bias. Design guidelines are limited.  \n3. **Assumption of vendor equivalence:** The method presumes \\(x_{PI} ≈ (E^H E)^{-1} E^H y\\), though vendor pipelines often apply proprietary filters or partial Fourier operations that violate this assumption. Robustness to such discrepancies should be tested.  \n4. **Experimental scope:** Retrospective studies use simulated data with known EΩ and coil maps, which does not fully emulate raw-free conditions. The 7T prospective result is qualitative only, lacking reader or quantitative evaluation.

Including modern latent diffusion or deep image prior baselines would strengthen positioning.  \n6. **Implementation specifics:** Important hyperparameters—such as the reweighting update frequency, ε choice, and wavelet transform—are not detailed, and the perturbation procedure lacks quantitative specifications.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify the pipeline for constructing EΩ and coil maps in the DICOM-only scenario; the cited reference does not describe this process.  \n- Provide details on hyperparameter sensitivity (λ, K, perturbation amplitude).  \n- Specify how prospective data were normalized and how perturbations were scaled relative to anatomy.  \n- Expand citations to unsupervised or latent diffusion MRI methods operating without raw data.  \n- Improve figure captions with units or perturbation examples for clarity.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, CUPID introduces a technically original and well-presented approach to PD-DL MRI reconstruction when raw data are unavailable.

Addressing these issues through additional ablation and quantitative evaluation would substantially strengthen the paper’s credibility and clinical relevance.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The work is promising and innovative, but requires clearer demonstration of raw-free feasibility, additional quantitative validation, and expanded comparisons before acceptance.",

Opening Paragraph\n\nThis manuscript addresses the critical problem of limited access to advanced physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) MRI reconstruction techniques in rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners typically only provide reconstructed DICOM images without raw k-space data access. The authors propose CUPID (Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity), a novel method that trains PD-DL reconstruction networks using only routine clinical DICOM images exported from scanners. CUPID employs a dual-component loss function: a compressibility term that evaluates sparsity in the wavelet domain, and a parallel imaging fidelity term that uses carefully designed perturbations to ensure reconstruction consistency. The authors demonstrate that CUPID achieves reconstruction quality comparable to supervised PD-DL and SSDU methods (which require raw k-space data), while outperforming conventional compressed sensing and generative approaches across multiple MRI datasets (knee, brain) with both retrospective (R=4) and prospective (R=9) undersampling. The method is also shown to be effective in zero-shot/subject-specific training scenarios, highlighting its potential to democratize access to high-quality fast MRI reconstruction in resource-limited settings.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths\n- The problem addressed has high clinical relevance as it tackles a significant equity issue in healthcare: the inability of rural and underserved communities to benefit from advanced MRI reconstruction techniques due to lack of raw data access.\n- CUPID represents the first successful method to train physics-driven deep learning MRI reconstruction without requiring raw k-space data, which is a substantial innovation in the field.\n- The comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets (knee and brain MRI), with both retrospective and prospective undersampling patterns, provides strong validation of the method's effectiveness.\n- The theoretical justification for the dual-loss function is well-developed, with clear explanations of how the parallel imaging fidelity term prevents the network from converging to trivial solutions.\n\n### Major Limitations\n- The paper lacks detailed information about computational requirements for training CUPID, which is critical for assessing its feasibility in the resource-limited settings it aims to serve. Specific details about GPU requirements, training time, and memory usage would strengthen the practical contribution.\n- The clinical implementation pathway is not sufficiently discussed. While the method is innovative, more detail is needed on how hospitals in rural/underserved areas would practically implement this solution, including integration with existing workflows.\n- The prospective study section is limited to a single example with R=9 acceleration, making it difficult to assess the method's performance across a broader range of practical acceleration rates that might be encountered in clinical settings.\n\n### Minor Strengths\n- The visualizations (particularly Figure 2) clearly illustrate the CUPID framework and its relationship to parallel imaging reconstruction.\n- The ablation studies on the λ parameter and number of perturbations provide valuable insights into the robustness of the approach to parameter choices.\n- The demonstration of compatibility with different parallel imaging reconstruction methods (GRAPPA vs. SENSE) strengthens the method's practical applicability.\n\n### Minor Limitations\n- Some figures (e.g., Figure 3, Figure 4) are quite dense and would benefit from more targeted highlighting of key differences between methods.\n- The paper mentions magnitude-only DICOMs as a potential limitation but doesn't provide sufficient discussion about how to handle this common scenario in practice.\n- The prospective study could be strengthened by including more quantitative metrics alongside the qualitative results.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance (High):** The work addresses a critical real-world problem with substantial clinical impact - the inequitable access to advanced MRI reconstruction techniques between specialized academic centers and rural/underserved areas. By enabling PD-DL training without raw data access, CUPID has the potential to democratize high-quality fast MRI, which could significantly improve healthcare equity.\n\n**Innovation (High):** The paper presents a truly innovative approach to MRI reconstruction training, being the first to successfully train physics-driven deep learning networks using only clinical DICOM images. The dual-component loss function combining compressibility evaluation with parallel imaging fidelity represents a novel conceptual framework that departs significantly from existing methods.\n\n**Evaluation (Good):** The evaluation is comprehensive across multiple datasets and acquisition scenarios, with appropriate comparisons to state-of-the-art methods. The inclusion of both retrospective and prospective undersampling studies strengthens the validation. However, more detailed computational requirements analysis and additional clinical implementation considerations would further strengthen the evaluation.\n\n**Reproducibility (Good):** The paper provides detailed implementation information in the appendices, including network architecture, training parameters, and perturbation strategies. The authors state that code will be released upon acceptance, which supports reproducibility. More specific details about hardware requirements would further enhance reproducibility for potential implementers.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nMinor revision\n\nThe manuscript presents a highly significant and innovative contribution to medical imaging with strong technical evaluation. The work addresses a critical equity issue in healthcare and offers a practical solution with real-world potential. The minor limitations identified (primarily around computational requirements and clinical implementation details) can be addressed with revisions that would strengthen the paper's practical impact without requiring major additional experiments. I recommend minor revision to clarify the computational requirements for training in resource-limited settings and provide more detailed implementation guidance for clinical translation.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe authors tackle a practical obstacle in modern MRI reconstruction: most physics‑driven deep‑learning (PD‑DL) pipelines presuppose access to raw k‑space data, which is rarely available outside large academic centres. To circumvent this, they introduce CUPID, an unsupervised training framework that operates solely on conventional DICOM images produced by parallel‑imaging reconstructions. CUPID combines a re‑weighted ℓ₁ compressibility loss with a fidelity term derived from deliberately crafted perturbations that remain recoverable by any parallel‑imaging algorithm. The method is evaluated on retrospectively and prospectively undersampled knee and brain scans (acceleration factors R = 4 and R = 9). Reported results suggest that CUPID achieves reconstruction quality on par with supervised and self‑supervised PD‑DL approaches that use raw data, and it outperforms traditional compressed‑sensing and recent generative baselines. The claimed novelty is the ability to train high‑performance PD‑DL models without raw k‑space, potentially widening access to accelerated MRI.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n*Significance.*  The problem of missing raw k‑space in routine clinical workflows is genuine, and a solution that works with DICOM‑only data could indeed broaden the applicability of PD‑DL methods.\n\n*Innovation.*  The paper merges a compressibility‑based ℓ₁ penalty with a perturbation‑driven fidelity term.  While each component builds on existing ideas (e.g., re‑weighted ℓ₁ from Alçalar et al., 2024; self‑supervision in SSDU), the particular combination is new.  However, the manuscript does not convincingly demonstrate that this synthesis yields a substantive methodological advance beyond what could be obtained by simpler alternatives.\n\n*Evaluation.*  The authors compare CUPID against a fairly extensive set of baselines (supervised PD‑DL, SSDU, EI, ScoreMRI, CS, CG‑SENSE) on three datasets and present quantitative tables (1–2) together with several figures (3–5, 10).  Yet crucial aspects of the experimental design—statistical testing, precise train/validation splits, and computational cost—are missing, which limits confidence in the reported improvements.\n\n*Reproducibility.*  The description of the network architecture, loss weighting (λ), perturbation count (K = 6), and training schedule is adequate, but essential procedural details are omitted.  In particular, the way coil‑sensitivity maps are obtained from DICOM‑only data, the handling of magnitude‑only images, and a full list of hyper‑parameters are not provided.  Moreover, the code is promised only after acceptance, precluding any independent verification at this stage.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n1. **Encoding operator E.**  The fidelity term depends on coil‑sensitivity maps, yet the manuscript merely cites “low‑resolution calibration scans” (Sec. 4.1) without explaining how those maps are estimated when only DICOM images are available.  This omission makes the method unreproducible for readers who lack raw k‑space.\n\n2. **Magnitude‑only DICOMs.**  Many clinical systems export only the magnitude of the reconstructed image.  CUPID’s loss function, however, assumes complex‑valued data.  The authors acknowledge this limitation (Sec. 6.2) but do not present any experimental evidence that the approach can be extended to magnitude‑only inputs, leaving its utility in real‑world settings unclear.\n\n3. **Statistical significance.**  Tables 1 and 2 report mean ± standard error but do not include any hypothesis tests (e.g., paired t‑tests or non‑parametric equivalents).  Consequently, claims of “comparable” performance to supervised PD‑DL or “superiority” over CS/EI/ScoreMRI lack quantitative support.\n\n4. **Computational cost.**  The manuscript provides no information on training time per epoch, total runtime, memory consumption, or inference speed (Sec. 4.4, 4.6).  Without these metrics it is impossible to assess whether the proposed zero‑shot fine‑tuning can be performed on hardware typically available in peripheral clinics.\n\n5. **Perturbation design.**  Figure 9 displays the visual appearance of the perturbations (random letters, numbers, card suits), but the text offers only a qualitative description.  Precise algorithmic details—size of the perturbations, intensity distribution, how K = 6 was selected—are missing.  Moreover, the trade‑off between perturbation count and reconstruction quality (Fig. 7, 8) is presented qualitatively; a quantitative analysis (e.g., PSNR versus training time) would be more informative.\n\n6. **Generalization to pathology.**  Although the authors motivate the work by the need to serve underserved populations with diverse disease presentations, all experiments are confined to healthy knee and brain scans.  No evaluation on pathological or multi‑center datasets is provided, so the claim of broad clinical relevance remains speculative.\n\n7. **Ablation of the fidelity term.**  Figure 6 illustrates visually the effect of setting λ → ∞ (compressibility loss only) versus λ = 0 (fidelity loss only), yet the corresponding quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM) are absent.  This makes it difficult to gauge the actual contribution of the fidelity component.\n\n8. **Dataset split and cross‑validation.**  The paper states the use of 300 training slices and 380/100 test slices (Sec. 4.1) but does not clarify whether splits are performed at the subject level, whether any cross‑validation was employed, or how data leakage was avoided.  Such details are essential for evaluating the robustness of the results.\n\n9. **Code and data availability.**  The authors commit to releasing code after acceptance but provide no current repository link or plan for data sharing.  The lack of immediate access hampers reproducibility and prevents other groups from benchmarking the method.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision**  \nThe manuscript introduces a conceptually interesting direction, yet the current presentation suffers from insufficient methodological detail, lack of statistical validation, and incomplete evaluation of practical constraints.  Substantial revisions are required before the work can be considered for publication.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents CUPID, an unsupervised training framework designed to address a key limitation in physics‑driven deep‑learning (PD‑DL) MRI reconstruction—namely, the dependence on raw k‑space data, which is often inaccessible in clinical settings. CUPID operates directly on standard DICOM images reconstructed by parallel‑imaging methods and integrates a re‑weighted ℓ₁ compressibility loss with a perturbation‑driven fidelity term. The method is tested on retrospectively and prospectively undersampled knee and brain scans with acceleration factors of 4 and 9. Results indicate performance comparable to supervised and self‑supervised PD‑DL models that use raw k‑space, and superior to compressed‑sensing and generative baselines. Overall, the study is clearly written and tackles a meaningful practical problem, though the evidence supporting methodological novelty and performance remains incomplete.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological clarity:** The paper does not sufficiently explain how coil‑sensitivity maps are derived from DICOM‑only data, a crucial element for reproducing the fidelity term.  \n2. **Data constraints:** CUPID assumes complex‑valued DICOMs, yet many clinical exports are magnitude‑only. Although this limitation is acknowledged, no experiments demonstrate feasibility in such settings.  \n3. **Statistical validation:** Reported mean ± standard‑error values lack accompanying hypothesis tests, leaving claims of comparable or superior performance unsubstantiated.  \n4. **Computational efficiency:** Training and inference runtimes, memory demands, and hardware requirements are not reported, obscuring the method’s real‑world applicability.  \n5. **Perturbation design:** The description of the crafted perturbations (letters, numbers, card suits) is qualitative only. Quantitative specifications and an analysis of trade‑offs between perturbation count and reconstruction quality are missing.  \n6. **Evaluation scope:** Experiments are limited to healthy data; no studies on pathological or multi‑center datasets are included, weakening arguments about clinical relevance.  \n7. **Ablation details:** The contribution of the fidelity term is shown visually but lacks quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) to substantiate its importance.  \n8. **Dataset splitting:** Subject‑level splits, cross‑validation procedures, and leakage prevention methods are not described, raising concerns about result reliability.  \n9. **Reproducibility:** Code and data are promised only post‑acceptance, and key hyper‑parameters remain unspecified.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n– Figures could provide quantitative results alongside qualitative illustrations.  \n– Clarify notation for λ and K to ensure interpretability.  \n– Provide consistent references to related methods such as SSDU and EI.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis work addresses a well‑motivated and practically important limitation of PD‑DL MRI by proposing an unsupervised DICOM‑based approach. The combination of compressibility loss and perturbation‑driven fidelity is conceptually interesting, but the manuscript requires more evidence to confirm its methodological contribution and empirical superiority. Missing statistical analyses, incomplete ablations, and absent details on computational cost, dataset handling, and code availability limit the current reproducibility and impact.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** — The paper offers a promising concept but needs substantial clarification, quantitative validation, and reproducibility enhancements before it can be considered for acceptance.",

Meanwhile, current general-domain multimodal models for videos still lack the capabilities to understand and engage in conversations about surgical videos. One major contributing factor is the absence of datasets in the surgical field. In this paper, we create a new dataset, Surg-QA, consisting of 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs, the largest of its kind so far. To build such a dataset, we propose a novel two-stage question-answer generation pipeline with LLM to learn surgical knowledge in a structured manner from the publicly available surgical lecture videos. The pipeline breaks down the generation process into two stages to significantly reduce the task complexity, allowing us to use a more affordable, locally deployed open-source LLM than the premium paid LLM services. It also mitigates the risk of LLM hallucinations during question-answer generation, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the generated data. We further train LLaVA-Surg, a novel vision-language conversational assistant capable of answering open-ended questions about surgical videos, on this Surg-QA dataset, and conduct comprehensive evaluations on zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks. We show that LLaVA-Surg significantly outperforms all previous general-domain models, demonstrating exceptional multimodal conversational skills in answering open-ended questions about surgical videos. We will release our code, model, and the instruction-tuning dataset.",

To support this, the authors developed Surg-QA, a large-scale dataset containing 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs, generated through a structured two-stage question-answer pipeline. This pipeline helps extract structured knowledge from surgical lecture videos, enabling the LLaVA-Surg model to understand complex surgical procedures and answer open-ended questions in a zero-shot setting. The model leverages CLIP for visual encoding and is fine-tuned on Surg-QA to specialize in surgical video question-answering, achieving superior performance compared to existing general-domain models.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.\tThe authors provide a novel dataset, Surg-QA, which is a significant resource for training multimodal surgical models, covering diverse surgical procedures and question-answer pairs.\n2.\tThe two-stage pipeline for question-answer generation mitigates hallucinations in LLM outputs, resulting in higher quality and reliability of generated data.\n3.\tLLaVA-Surg demonstrates notable improvements over general multimodal models in zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks, showcasing its efficacy in understanding surgical context.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The paper should compare its model with recent multimodal LLM approaches, specifically ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), which combines reasoning and action for complex tasks.\n[1] Yao, S., Zhao, J., Yu, D., Du, N., Shafran, I., Narasimhan, K., & Cao, Y. (2023, January). ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).\n2. Using CLIP for frame-by-frame encoding lacks temporal modeling and increases processing costs and redundancy, burdening the LLM as frame count grows.\n3. The paper lacks an in-depth error analysis, especially regarding potential hallucinations or misunderstandings in complex surgical scenarios. Although the authors claim to reduce hallucinations, achieving perfect performance seems challenging.\n4. The model’s adaptability to other medical or clinical fields is unclear, as broader evaluations on datasets like RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA are missing, which may limit its wider applicability.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Does splitting video into frames for CLIP’s visual encoder lead to a loss of spatiotemporal information, and wouldn’t a video encoder like Video Swin Transformer [2] better capture temporal dynamics?\n[2] Liu, Z., Ning, J., Cao, Y., Wei, Y., Zhang, Z., Lin, S., & Hu, H. (2022). Video swin transformer. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 3202-3211).\n2. How does LLaVA-Surg perform compared to other state-of-the-art multimodal methods? In addition to general multimodal models, a detailed comparison with models like ReAct would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Has comparison with other two-stage methods [3] in VQA task been overlooked?\n[3] Gai, X., Zhou, C., Liu, J., Feng, Y., Wu, J., & Liu, Z. (2024).

Is the two-stage question-answer generation process applicable to other medical fields, and if so, what adjustments would be required? Additionally, validating the method’s performance on public datasets like RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA would strengthen its generalizability.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The clinicians have reviewed the output of their MLLM model, but the paper does not confirm whether clinicians or domain experts have reviewed the raw data to ensure accuracy and reliability.\n2. Concerns regarding the release, privacy, and permission risks associated with using sensitive surgical videos are not adequately discussed.\n3. The paper lacks comprehensive validation across essential surgical downstream tasks and other surgical QA datasets, which are crucial for demonstrating clinical usability. There is also a need for more rigorous benchmarking against a broader range of state-of-the-art video MLLM architectures to establish the dataset's utility and the model's performance more robustly.\n4. The comparison of the proposed methods with SOTA methods is limited and does not include the latest works. The manuscript also lacks evaluations with models trained on other surgical datasets, limiting the assessment of the proposed model's generalizability across different surgical scenarios.\n5. The paper may need to evaluate the visual quality of the surgical videos.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How can the quality of the data be ensured? The data collected may already contain a lot of noise and has been reprocessed by an LLM. Is there any person or clinician reviewing these raw data?\n2. Can the data be released? Are there privacy and permission risks associated with the collected data?\n3. The authors need to conduct more zero-shot evaluations on downstream tasks relevant to the surgical field, such as phase recognition, action/instrument classification, and other surgical domain VQA data to demonstrate the clinical usability of their method.\n4.

Although the target use case is the surgical domain, the contribution is largely methodological: building and evaluating a multimodal AI system that couples LLMs with video encoders.  That aligns reasonably with *IEEE TMI*’s scope of imaging methodology, machine learning, and computational analysis rather than purely clinical application. ✅\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \n   The novelty lies in (i) a two‑stage structured LLM pipeline to generate video–QA pairs that aim to reduce hallucination, and (ii) adaptation of visual–language architectures (CLIP + LLaMA) to model spatiotemporal surgical video data.  The proposed dataset scale is unprecedented for surgery videos.  However, parts of the model architecture and evaluation pipeline are close to prior art (Video‑LLaVA, Video‑ChatGPT), so the conceptual advance is moderate though useful.  The main novelty is practical—data generation and domain translation—rather than a new imaging theory.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \n   – Implementation details are explicitly documented: dataset sources (WebSurg, CholecT50), number of procedures, training setup, hardware, and hyperparameters.  \n   – The two‑stage data pipeline is well motivated but only partially validated; quality control of automatically generated QA pairs appears anecdotal.  \n   – Quantitative evaluation relies heavily on GPT‑based automatic scoring, supplemented by a small (n = 60) clinician validation showing correlation. Statistical significance or inter‑rater reliability is not reported.  \n   – Reproducibility is strong: authors state release of code, weights, and data; therefore experiments could be replicated.\n\n4. **Clarity & Presentation**  \n   Manuscript is clear, with appropriate figures, tables, and consistent terminology.  Some minor grammatical and spacing issues (“LLaV A‑Surg” artifacts) and typographical inconsistencies need correction, but overall readability is high.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \n   Data originate from publicly available, de‑identified surgical videos (WebSurg); no patient PII is included.  Authors commit to open‑sourcing under Creative Commons BY‑NC 4.0.  Ethical and licensing aspects appear properly considered.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \n   The manuscript proposes **LLaVA‑Surg**, a surgical video conversational assistant built by fine‑tuning a vision–language model (CLIP + LLaMA) on **Surg‑QA**, a new dataset of 102 k automatically generated surgical video QA pairs.  The dataset is produced via a two‑stage pipeline that extracts structured observations, reasons, and plans from transcribed surgical lectures using LLM prompting, aiming to reduce hallucination and cost.  The model is evaluated on zero‑shot surgical video QA tasks, outperforming general‑domain multimodal baselines (Video‑LLaVA, Video‑ChatGPT) and correlating well with clinician scoring.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n   * First large‑scale multimodal conversational dataset for surgery videos.  \n   * Practical innovation in structured Q&A generation mitigating hallucination.  \n   * Demonstrated improvement over multimodal baselines and quantitative clinician validation.  \n   * Clear reproducibility plan with public release of data and code.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n   * Architectural novelty is incremental; the framework closely follows prior general‑domain models.  \n   * Evaluation heavily depends on GPT‑scoring without strong human‑study validation.  \n   * Lack of rigorous uncertainty or error analysis; limited ablation on two‑stage pipeline benefits.  \n   * Clinical or imaging physics insights limited—targets more at AI engineering than imaging methodology per se.  \n   * Minor clarity and formatting issues.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n   1. **Positioning for TMI readers.** Clarify how the work advances medical‑imaging methodology beyond dataset creation.  Discuss broader implications for quantitative surgical video analysis (e.g., phase recognition, tool tracking).  \n   2. **Validation robustness.** Provide a larger‑scale human evaluation, or complementary objective metrics (e.g., BLEU/ROUGE, factual accuracy vs reference).  Report inter‑rater consistency between clinicians and GPT.  \n   3. **Ablation on pipeline.** Quantify how the two‑stage generation reduces hallucination relative to end‑to‑end prompting across multiple samples, not just anecdotal examples.  \n   4. **Generalizability.** Evaluate transfer to unseen surgical categories or other datasets (e.g., Cholec80‑VQA) to demonstrate domain robustness.  \n   5. **Ethical/compliance detail.** Add explicit statement of patient de‑identification and reuse permissions from WebSurg to conform to TMI reproducibility policies.\n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n   * Fix typographical spacing (“LLaV A‑Surg → LLaVA‑Surg”), unify variable notation.  \n   * Some figures (e.g., Fig 4) contain small text—enlarge for print quality.  \n   * Refer to ICLR in‑review footers should be removed for journal submission.  \n   * Include statistical uncertainties (mean ± SD) in Table 3.  \n   * Verify citation formatting consistency (author–year vs numeric).  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation**  \n   **Major Revision.**  \n   The work is promising and methodologically sound but requires strengthened experimental validation and clearer alignment to TMI’s methodological focus.  With improved quantitative and statistical analyses, the contribution could meet TMI standards.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** 4 / 5 – High confidence in technical assessment; moderate confidence in ultimate journal fit.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nA solid and timely paper bridging multimodal LLMs and surgical video understanding.  Methodological rigor is acceptable, novelty moderate, and reproducibility excellent.  Recommend *Major Revision* to add comparative and statistical depth and to better articulate methodological innovation for medical‑imaging readership.",

The authors create Surg-QA, a dataset of 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs derived from 44,000 video clips across 2,201 surgical procedures (Page 1, lines 006-009). The core methodological contribution is a novel two-stage question-answer generation pipeline that first extracts structured information (observation, reason, plan, deduction) from surgical lecture transcripts using Llama-3-70B, then generates instruction-tuning data (Figure 2, Section 3). LLaVA-Surg builds upon Video-ChatGPT architecture, combining CLIP visual encoder with Llama language backbone (Page 2, lines 054-056). Evaluation on zero-shot surgical video question-answering shows LLaVA-Surg achieving 2.45/5.0 score compared to 1.32 for Video-LLaVA and 1.04 for Video-ChatGPT (Table 3). The authors validate their GPT-based evaluation framework against clinician assessments (Figure 5).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Limited mathematical rigor in model formulation**\n  - Equation 1 provides only high-level notation without specifying video encoding dimensions or feature extraction details\n  - Equation 2 lacks mathematical precision in defining multi-turn conversation structure, particularly the conditional logic\n  - The temporal-fusion operation description (Page 7, lines 324-330) lacks formal mathematical definition of average-pooling operations and concatenation dimensions\n  - No formal loss function or training objective is provided despite claims of end-to-end instruction tuning\n\n• **Insufficient evaluation methodology and baselines**\n  - GPT-3.5-turbo evaluation on only 4,359 test pairs (Page 7, lines 377-381) may not capture full model capabilities across surgical specialties\n  - Clinician validation limited to 60 samples from only two experts (Page 8, lines 419-427), insufficient for statistical significance\n  - No comparison with recent surgical VQA methods like SurgicalGPT (Seenivasan et al., 2023) which is cited but not benchmarked\n  - Accuracy@1 and accuracy@all metrics (Table 3) lack clear mathematical definition and clinical relevance justification\n\n• **Dataset quality and bias concerns**\n  - Two-stage generation pipeline claims to reduce hallucination (Page 4, lines 189-195) but provides only anecdotal evidence in Figure 3\n  - Heavy reliance on WebSurg source (2,151 videos, Page 4, line 216) introduces potential institutional and procedural bias\n  - No inter-annotator agreement or quality control metrics for the 102K generated pairs\n  - Surgical knowledge pyramid (Figure 1) categorization lacks validation from surgical education experts\n\n• **Technical architecture limitations**\n  - Architecture description (Page 6, lines 324-330) lacks novelty, essentially adapting existing Video-ChatGPT without surgical-specific modifications\n  - Training details show only 6 hours on 8 A100 GPUs (Page 7, lines 366-367) which may be insufficient for complex surgical reasoning\n  - No ablation studies on key components like temporal fusion or the structured information extraction approach\n  - Missing details on handling variable-length surgical procedures and multi-stage operations\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical formalization and technical rigor**\n  - Provide detailed mathematical formulation of the temporal-fusion operation including tensor dimensions and operations\n  - Define formal loss functions for instruction tuning and specify optimization objectives clearly\n  - Add rigorous mathematical definition of the multi-turn conversation structure beyond Equation 2\n  - Include formal analysis of the two-stage generation pipeline's effect on reducing hallucination probability\n\n• **Strengthen evaluation framework and expand baselines**\n  - Conduct evaluation on larger test sets with stratification across surgical specialties represented in Figure 4c\n  - Recruit more clinical experts (minimum 5-10) and evaluate larger sample sizes (500+ cases) for statistical significance\n  - Include comprehensive comparison with SurgicalGPT and other recent surgical VQA methods with standardized metrics\n  - Provide clear mathematical definitions and clinical relevance justification for accuracy@1 and accuracy@all metrics\n\n• **Address dataset bias and quality validation**\n  - Implement systematic quality control with inter-annotator agreement metrics for generated question-answer pairs\n  - Include datasets from multiple sources beyond WebSurg to reduce institutional bias\n  - Validate the surgical knowledge pyramid framework with surgical education specialists\n  - Provide quantitative analysis of hallucination reduction beyond the single example in Figure 3\n\n• **Improve technical contributions and experimental design**\n  - Introduce surgical-specific architectural modifications rather than directly adapting Video-ChatGPT\n  - Conduct comprehensive ablation studies on temporal fusion, structured extraction, and multi-stage training\n  - Extend training duration and provide learning curves to demonstrate convergence\n  - Add detailed analysis of performance across different surgical procedure types and complexity levels",

The authors address the scarcity of specialized datasets for training such models by proposing Surg-QA, a large-scale dataset of surgical video-instruction pairs generated through a two-stage question-answer generation pipeline. The authors claim that LLaV A-Surg significantly outperforms existing models in zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks, demonstrating robust multimodal conversational skills.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning. The creation of Surg-QA and the development of LLaV A-Surg are significant contributions, especially considering the lack of specialized datasets for surgical video understanding. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more thorough discussion of how this work compares to recent advancements in multimodal LLMs for video understanding. While the authors mention several related works, a more detailed comparison with models like Video-LLaV A and Video-ChatGPT would strengthen the novelty argument.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design. The evaluation is primarily conducted on Surg-QA, which is a valuable resource but also poses a limitation since the model is evaluated on the same dataset it was trained on. Including external validation on independent datasets or real-world surgical scenarios would enhance the credibility of the results. Additionally, the authors should consider evaluating the model's performance on different surgical procedures to assess its generalizability.\n\n3. Comparison with Baselines. The comparison with existing models (LLaV A-Med, Video-LLaV A, and Video-ChatGPT) is informative, but the authors should include a broader range of baselines, particularly those that have demonstrated strong performance in multimodal tasks. Including more recent state-of-the-art models would provide a clearer picture of LLaV A-Surg's advancements.\n\n4. Reproducibility. The authors state that they will release the Surg-QA dataset, model, and code, which is commendable. However, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters used in the experiments. Providing this information is crucial for reproducibility and transparency.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures and Clarity: Figures 1 and 2 are well-designed but could benefit from additional labels and legends to clarify the components and steps involved in the data generation pipeline.\n2. Notation Consistency: The notation used in Section 2.1 is inconsistent, particularly the forward operator, which should be clarified.\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"Q&A\", \"GPT\") are used without definition, which can be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the terminology.\n4.

The creation of Surg-QA is a noteworthy contribution, providing a large-scale resource for training and evaluation. The proposed two-stage question-answer generation pipeline is innovative and addresses the issue of LLM hallucinations effectively. However, the evaluation primarily relies on the training dataset, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, while the authors aim to release the dataset, model, and code, more detailed methodological descriptions are required for full reproducibility. Overall, the manuscript has significant potential but requires additional validation and clarity to fully meet the standards of TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision.

        "text": "## LLAVA-Surg: Towards Multimodal Surgical Assistant via Structured Lecture Learning\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper introduces LLaVA-Surg, a multimodal conversational assistant for surgical videos, and Surg-QA, a new dataset of 102K video–instruction pairs generated from surgical lecture videos using a two-stage LLM pipeline. The pipeline first extracts structured surgical knowledge (observation, reason, plan, deduction) from ASR transcripts and then generates multi-turn question–answer pairs, with an additional 2K concept-alignment pairs from CholecT50. Fine-tuning a Video-ChatGPT-style architecture on this data yields improvements over general-domain baselines on a zero-shot evaluation conducted on Surg-QA, with supplementary clinician ratings showing rough alignment with GPT-based scoring.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationA clear, practical two-stage extraction→generation pipeline that structures lecture transcripts before Q/A synthesis to reduce hallucinations and improve controllability.The knowledge decomposition into observation, reason, plan, and deduction concretely targets higher-level surgical reasoning beyond perception.Efficient training setup (frozen CLIP, lightweight video pooling) yields a workable surgical video assistant with modest compute.\n- Experimental rigor and validationProvides a large-scale, diverse corpus of surgical video clips covering a wide range of procedures and categories.Includes a small clinician validation that compares human ratings to GPT-based scoring to partially justify the automated evaluation approach.Reports multiple quantitative metrics (0–5 score, Accuracy@1, Accuracy@all) and qualitative examples.\n- Clarity of presentationThe data generation pipeline is presented with step-by-step prompts and few-shot examples, improving reproducibility.Architectural choices and training details are described succinctly and transparently (e.g., frozen visual encoder, learning rate, epochs).\n- Significance of contributionsSurg-QA adds a substantial volume of surgical video Q/A data, especially with reasoning-level content derived from expert lecture narrations.Demonstrates that adapting general video-chat architectures to the surgical domain with structured instruction tuning can meaningfully improve domain-specific performance.\n\nTechnical novelty and innovation\n\n- A clear, practical two-stage extraction→generation pipeline that structures lecture transcripts before Q/A synthesis to reduce hallucinations and improve controllability.\n- The knowledge decomposition into observation, reason, plan, and deduction concretely targets higher-level surgical reasoning beyond perception.\n- Efficient training setup (frozen CLIP, lightweight video pooling) yields a workable surgical video assistant with modest compute.\n\nExperimental rigor and validation\n\n- Provides a large-scale, diverse corpus of surgical video clips covering a wide range of procedures and categories.\n- Includes a small clinician validation that compares human ratings to GPT-based scoring to partially justify the automated evaluation approach.\n- Reports multiple quantitative metrics (0–5 score, Accuracy@1, Accuracy@all) and qualitative examples.\n\nClarity of presentation\n\n- The data generation pipeline is presented with step-by-step prompts and few-shot examples, improving reproducibility.\n- Architectural choices and training details are described succinctly and transparently (e.g., frozen visual encoder, learning rate, epochs).\n\nSignificance of contributions\n\n- Surg-QA adds a substantial volume of surgical video Q/A data, especially with reasoning-level content derived from expert lecture narrations.\n- Demonstrates that adapting general video-chat architectures to the surgical domain with structured instruction tuning can meaningfully improve domain-specific performance.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsVideo modeling is limited to temporal/spatial average pooling with a frozen CLIP encoder; richer temporal modeling (attention/temporal transformers) is absent and may cap performance on fine-grained temporal reasoning.The “reduced hallucination” claim for the two-stage pipeline is shown mostly via anecdotal examples; no systematic ablation quantifies hallucination rates versus end-to-end generation.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesEvaluation is primarily on the authors’ own Surg-QA test split using GPT-3.5 scoring that references the same extracted “observations,” raising concerns of circularity and bias toward the data generation pipeline.No comparisons to strong, domain-adapted surgical MLLMs (e.g., Surgical-LLaVA, S2CAN, SurgVidLM, SurgVLM, Surgery-R1), nor to broader surgical pretraining frameworks (PeskaVLP, SurgBench) that are directly relevant.The clinician study is small (n=60) and sampling is stratified by GPT score rather than random; correlation is claimed qualitatively without statistics (e.g., correlation coefficients, inter-rater agreement).\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSome equations and tensor shapes are imprecise for ViT/CLIP outputs; minor but could be clarified to avoid confusion.The description of how multi-turn history is encoded and evaluated is brief; it’s unclear how much the model leverages conversational context versus single-turn prompts.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsImportant contemporaneous surgical MLLMs and datasets are not cited or compared: Surgical-LLaVA (hierarchical instruction tuning from surgical annotations with GPT-3.5 expansion), S2CAN (memory-augmented surgical VQA), SurgVidLM (SVU-31K and StageFocus/MFA), SurgVLM (large-scale, hierarchical multimodal corpus and benchmark), Surgery-R1 (reasoning with RFT and grounding), PeskaVLP (LLM-augmented lecture pretraining), and SurgBench (foundation pretraining and evaluation). Some of these works also leverage lecture narrations/LLM augmentation, challenging “first” claims.\n\nTechnical limitations or concerns\n\n- Video modeling is limited to temporal/spatial average pooling with a frozen CLIP encoder; richer temporal modeling (attention/temporal transformers) is absent and may cap performance on fine-grained temporal reasoning.\n- The “reduced hallucination” claim for the two-stage pipeline is shown mostly via anecdotal examples; no systematic ablation quantifies hallucination rates versus end-to-end generation.\n\nExperimental gaps or methodological issues\n\n- Evaluation is primarily on the authors’ own Surg-QA test split using GPT-3.5 scoring that references the same extracted “observations,” raising concerns of circularity and bias toward the data generation pipeline.\n- No comparisons to strong, domain-adapted surgical MLLMs (e.g., Surgical-LLaVA, S2CAN, SurgVidLM, SurgVLM, Surgery-R1), nor to broader surgical pretraining frameworks (PeskaVLP, SurgBench) that are directly relevant.\n- The clinician study is small (n=60) and sampling is stratified by GPT score rather than random; correlation is claimed qualitatively without statistics (e.g., correlation coefficients, inter-rater agreement).\n\nClarity or presentation issues\n\n- Some equations and tensor shapes are imprecise for ViT/CLIP outputs; minor but could be clarified to avoid confusion.\n- The description of how multi-turn history is encoded and evaluated is brief; it’s unclear how much the model leverages conversational context versus single-turn prompts.\n\nMissing related work or comparisons\n\n- Important contemporaneous surgical MLLMs and datasets are not cited or compared: Surgical-LLaVA (hierarchical instruction tuning from surgical annotations with GPT-3.5 expansion), S2CAN (memory-augmented surgical VQA), SurgVidLM (SVU-31K and StageFocus/MFA), SurgVLM (large-scale, hierarchical multimodal corpus and benchmark), Surgery-R1 (reasoning with RFT and grounding), PeskaVLP (LLM-augmented lecture pretraining), and SurgBench (foundation pretraining and evaluation). Some of these works also leverage lecture narrations/LLM augmentation, challenging “first” claims.\n\n### Detailed Comments\n\n- Technical soundness evaluationThe two-stage pipeline is well-motivated: constrained extraction before generation is a reasonable way to reduce hallucinations and ensure video-answerable content. The prompt designs and few-shot examples are helpful. However, the paper would be strengthened by a quantitative ablation showing reductions in hallucination (e.g., human audit of data quality for staged vs end-to-end pipelines).The model architecture is a faithful adaptation of LLaVA-style video pooling. While simple and efficient, the lack of temporal modeling (beyond mean pooling) may limit handling of transient cues, phase transitions, and cause–effect reasoning common in surgery.

Did you audit a sample to estimate the proportion of text-only answerable items?\n- Why were comparisons to domain-specific surgical MLLMs (Surgical-LLaVA, S2CAN, SurgVidLM, SurgVLM, Surgery-R1) omitted? Can you include results on public benchmarks (EndoVis-18-VQA, Cholec80-VQA, SSG-VQA) to establish external validity and SOTA claims?\n- Could you report statistical measures for the clinician vs GPT evaluation (e.g., Pearson/Spearman correlation, inter-rater reliability), and describe the selection rationale for the 60 samples to avoid confirmation bias?\n- What is the impact of the small concept-alignment set (≈2K from CholecT50)? Can you provide an ablation of training with/without this subset?\n- How sensitive is the model to frame sampling rate and the number of frames? Have you explored lightweight temporal modules (e.g., temporal attention) to complement average pooling?\n- Are there license or usage constraints when distributing URLs or derived annotations from WebSurg content? Please clarify legal and ethical compliance, including any agreements or approvals.\n- Can you release a subset of Surg-QA with independent human-verified ground truth to facilitate fair, model-agnostic evaluation without relying on GPT scorers or the same extraction pipeline?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis work presents a valuable dataset and a practical pipeline for constructing multimodal conversational training data from surgical lectures, coupled with a straightforward yet effective model adaptation. The structured two-stage extraction→generation approach is a thoughtful contribution likely to improve controllability and reduce hallucinations relative to direct prompting. The dataset’s breadth and emphasis on reasoning (reason/plan/deduction) are particularly useful for advancing surgical video understanding. However, the current evaluation is largely inward-facing: it uses a scorer aligned with the data-generation pipeline and lacks comparisons to recent, relevant surgical MLLMs on established public benchmarks. Claims of being the “first” expert-level surgical video conversation model are overstated given contemporaneous works. Strengthening the evaluation with external benchmarks, domain-specific baselines, human audits of data quality, and statistical analysis of clinician correlations would significantly bolster the paper. With these additions and a moderated positioning relative to prior work, the contribution would be strong and of high interest to the multimodal medical AI community.",

The approach decomposes lecture transcripts into structured surgical knowledge (observation, reason, plan, deduction) before producing multi-turn question–answer pairs, supplemented by 2K concept-alignment pairs from CholecT50. Fine-tuning a Video-ChatGPT-style architecture on this dataset yields improved zero-shot results on Surg-QA, with clinician assessments showing rough consistency with automated GPT-based scoring. The manuscript is detailed, logically organized, and technically sound, though its claims and evaluation scope warrant broader validation.  \n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Evaluation Scope and External Comparisons** – The evaluation relies primarily on the Surg-QA test split scored by GPT-3.5 using the same extracted “observations,” raising concerns of circularity and bias. No experiments are conducted on public benchmarks (EndoVis-18-VQA, Cholec80-VQA, SSG-VQA), nor are comparisons made to strong, domain-adapted surgical MLLMs such as Surgical-LLaVA, S2CAN, SurgVidLM, SurgVLM, or Surgery-R1. This limits external validity and SOTA positioning.  \n2. **Quantitative Validation of Hallucination Reduction** – The claim that the two-stage pipeline reduces hallucination is only supported by anecdotal examples; no quantitative ablation or human audit demonstrates this effect.  \n3. **Modeling Limitations** – Video modeling depends on temporal/spatial average pooling of frozen CLIP features. The absence of richer temporal modeling (e.g., attention or transformers) constrains fine-grained temporal and causal reasoning.  \n4. **Clinician Evaluation** – The clinician validation (n=60) is small and stratified by GPT score, lacking statistical analysis (e.g., correlations, inter-rater reliability). This weakens confidence in the claimed alignment between human and GPT evaluations.  \n5. **Positioning and Related Work** – Several contemporary works using LLMs and surgical video data (e.g., Surgical-LLaVA, PeskaVLP, S2CAN, SurgVidLM, Surgery-R1, SurgVLM, SurgBench) are unacknowledged or not compared, challenging the “first” claims and obscuring the incremental contribution.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify tensor shapes and notation for ViT/CLIP outputs to prevent confusion.  \n- Provide more detail on how conversational history is encoded and utilized during multi-turn evaluation.  \n- Discuss the role and impact of the 2K concept-alignment subset from CholecT50.  \n- Include statistical metrics (e.g., correlation coefficients) when reporting clinician versus GPT agreement.  \n- Verify ethical and copyright compliance when using lecture video data from WebSurg.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nLLaVA-Surg presents a meaningful contribution by introducing structured extraction–generation for building large-scale surgical QA data and adapting general video–language architectures to a clinical domain. The work is strong in technical transparency, dataset scale, and methodological clarity. However, its validation remains inward-looking, with limited external benchmarking, small-scale clinician study, and unquantified hallucination analysis. Clarifying its relationship to concurrent MLLMs and incorporating human-verified evaluations would significantly enhance robustness and credibility.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The study offers a promising dataset and pipeline but requires broader comparative evaluation, quantitative validation of its claims, and stronger statistical and methodological support before it can be considered for acceptance.",

        "text": "# Review Report: LLAVA-SURG: TOWARDS MULTIMODAL SURGICAL ASSISTANT VIA STRUCTURED LECTURE LEARNING\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical gap in surgical video understanding by introducing Surg-QA, a novel large-scale dataset of 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs derived from 44,000 video clips across 2,201 surgical procedures. The authors propose a two-stage question-answer generation pipeline that first extracts structured surgical knowledge (encompassing four levels of understanding from basic object identification to expert-level deduction) from surgical lecture videos, then generates high-quality instruction-tuning data while mitigating LLM hallucination. Building upon this dataset, they develop LLaVA-Surg, a vision-language conversational assistant specifically trained for surgical video understanding. The results demonstrate that LLaVA-Surg significantly outperforms existing general-domain multimodal models in zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks, achieving a score of 2.45 (vs. 1.32 for Video-LLaVA) on a 0-5 scale, with strong alignment between GPT and clinician evaluations confirming the model's surgical domain competence.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The two-stage pipeline for surgical video data generation is a significant methodological contribution that effectively mitigates LLM hallucination while maintaining cost-effectiveness compared to premium LLM services\n- The four-level surgical knowledge pyramid (Object, Action, Reason, Plan & Deduction) provides a valuable conceptual framework for understanding surgical video complexity\n- The comprehensive dataset statistics (Figure 4) demonstrate unprecedented scale and diversity in surgical video instruction data, covering multiple surgical domains and knowledge levels\n- The clinician evaluation showing strong correlation with GPT scoring provides compelling evidence for the evaluation framework's validity\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper lacks a clear explanation of how the Surg-QA dataset was partitioned for training and testing, particularly regarding whether procedures were kept in exclusive sets to prevent data leakage\n- The evaluation metrics (0-5 scoring) lack detailed inter-rater reliability analysis between clinicians, which is critical for medical domain validation\n- While the two-stage approach reduces hallucination, the paper doesn't provide quantitative metrics on hallucination reduction compared to end-to-end approaches\n- The model's limitations in handling complex temporal reasoning across long surgical procedures aren't thoroughly analyzed, despite surgical videos often containing multi-step sequences\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The visual examples (Figures 5-8) effectively illustrate the model's capabilities and the quality of generated instruction data\n- The detailed prompt engineering (Appendix A) enhances reproducibility of the data generation pipeline\n- The comparison with both general-domain and surgical-specific VQA datasets (Tables 1-2) clearly positions Surg-QA's unique contribution\n- The open-source commitment to release code, model, and dataset aligns well with TMI's reproducibility standards\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper would benefit from more detailed error analysis of LLaVA-Surg's failures, particularly regarding specific surgical domains where performance lags\n- Some figures (e.g., Figure 4) contain overlapping text that reduces readability\n- The computational requirements for the two-stage pipeline are mentioned but not fully quantified in terms of total processing time/cost\n- The paper would be strengthened by including comparative training time for the two-stage approach versus end-to-end methods\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a critical gap in surgical AI by providing the first large-scale dataset specifically designed for surgical video understanding and a specialized model that demonstrates superior performance over general-domain alternatives. The clinical relevance is substantial as surgical video understanding can support surgical training, intraoperative assistance, and procedural documentation. The impact is amplified by the open-source release, which will accelerate research in this niche but important medical domain.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper introduces a novel two-stage pipeline that systematically extracts structured surgical knowledge before generating instruction data, representing a significant methodological innovation. The four-level surgical knowledge pyramid provides a new conceptual framework for understanding surgical video complexity. While building upon existing multimodal architectures, the adaptation specifically for surgical video with temporal modeling represents a meaningful advancement beyond general video understanding models.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is comprehensive, including quantitative metrics (0-5 scoring), clinician validation, and comparative analysis against multiple baselines. The alignment between GPT and clinician scoring (Figure 5) provides confidence in the evaluation methodology. However, the assessment would be strengthened by more detailed error analysis, inter-rater reliability metrics for clinician evaluation, and specific analysis of performance across different surgical domains and knowledge levels.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides exceptional detail on the data generation pipeline, including complete prompts (Appendix A), which greatly enhances reproducibility. The model architecture, training parameters, and evaluation protocols are thoroughly documented. The commitment to release Surg-QA, LLaVA-Surg, and all code aligns perfectly with TMI's reproducibility standards. The only limitation is the lack of detailed information about dataset partitioning for training/testing.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThe paper presents a significant contribution to surgical AI with methodological innovations, comprehensive evaluation, and strong commitment to open science. The work addresses an important gap in surgical video understanding and demonstrates clear superiority over existing approaches. The minor issues identified (primarily regarding dataset partitioning details and expanded error analysis) can be addressed through revision without requiring additional experiments. With these revisions, this paper would be a valuable addition to the TMI literature.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThe manuscript tackles the chronic shortage of large‑scale multimodal data for surgical video understanding. By assembling a substantial collection of surgery videos paired with textual questions and answers, the authors aim to enable the development of conversational assistants that can reason about operative procedures. The proposed pipeline first extracts salient visual information and then generates answers in a second stage, thereby attempting to curb the hallucination problems that are common in video‑language models.\n\n**## General feedback**\n\n- **Significance:** Addressing the paucity of surgical video‑text corpora is a clinically relevant endeavour. A dataset of the size described has the potential to accelerate downstream research in intra‑operative decision support and education.  \n- **Innovation:** The two‑stage extraction‑generation framework is a sensible strategy to reduce hallucinations, and it aligns with recent trends in staged prompting. While the overall architecture follows established video‑LLM designs, the application to a surgical domain is novel.  \n- **Evaluation:** The authors present quantitative results using an automatic GPT‑3.5 scorer (Table 3) and complement these with a modest clinician study (Figure 5). However, the evaluation would benefit from comparisons against existing surgical VQA benchmarks (e.g., EndoVis‑18‑VQA, Cholec80‑VQA) and a clearer separation between training and test splits to avoid potential over‑fitting.  \n- **Reproducibility:** Important implementation details—such as video preprocessing steps, full prompt templates, validation split construction, random seeds, licensing of the source videos, and access conditions for Llama‑3‑70B—are presently missing. The promised open‑source release also lacks a concrete repository link and licensing information, which limits immediate reproducibility.\n\n**## Specific comments / critiques**\n\n1. **Dataset description & bias:** The manuscript reports aggregate numbers (44 K videos, 102 K QA pairs) but does not provide per‑procedure statistics, class‑balance breakdowns, or quality metrics (e.g., human validation rates). Because the source material originates from WebSurg lectures, the diversity of operative settings and camera viewpoints may be limited; a more detailed analysis would help assess potential bias.  \n\n2. **Data split & validation:** While training (1 935 procedures) and test (216 procedures) partitions are mentioned, a validation set is not described. Clarifying whether any hyper‑parameter tuning was performed on the test split (Section 5.1) would strengthen confidence in the reported results.  \n\n3. **Baseline fairness:** Table 3 juxtaposes zero‑shot off‑the‑shelf Video‑LLaVA and Video‑ChatGPT, which have not been fine‑tuned on the Surg‑QA data. Providing fair baselines—i.e., fine‑tuning these models on the same training set—would give a more meaningful performance context.  \n\n4. **Ablation of the two‑stage pipeline:** The paper includes a single qualitative illustration (Figure 3) indicating reduced hallucination, yet quantitative ablations that isolate the extraction stage from a direct end‑to‑end generation are absent. Such experiments would clarify the contribution of each stage.  \n\n5. **Human evaluation scope & rigor:** The clinician study evaluates only 60 video‑question pairs (Figure 5) and reports correlation without statistical testing (e.g., Pearson’s r, confidence intervals). In addition, the ad‑hoc GPT‑based scoring (0‑5) lacks validation against clinically meaningful correctness criteria (Figure 9). Expanding the sample size and incorporating formal statistical analyses would make the human evaluation more robust.  \n\n6. **Metric justification:** The introduced “Score 0‑5” and “accuracy@all/1” metrics are non‑standard; providing evidence that they correlate with expert judgments or downstream clinical utility would increase their credibility.  \n\n7. **Training & compute details:** Basic training hyper‑parameters (learning rate, epochs, batch size, GPU count) are reported, yet information on total FLOPs, inference latency, and the impact of freezing versus fine‑tuning the visual encoder is missing. Including these details would aid reproducibility and allow assessment of computational efficiency.  \n\n8. **External benchmark testing:** Although the manuscript cites several surgical VQA datasets (Table 2), the proposed model is not evaluated on them. Testing on established benchmarks would demonstrate the model’s generalizability beyond the newly generated dataset.  \n\n9. **Safety & ethical considerations:** While the authors acknowledge hallucination risks, a systematic mitigation strategy is not presented. Moreover, discussions of privacy, informed consent, and potential misuse of surgical video data are absent. Addressing these ethical aspects would strengthen the manuscript’s impact.  \n\n10. **Open‑source release clarity:** The lack of a repository URL, explicit license, and verification of the source video licensing (WebSurg terms) hampers reproducibility. Additionally, reliance on the commercial Llama‑3‑70B model may limit exact replication for other researchers. Providing clear release information and, if possible, an open‑source alternative would be valuable.  \n\n**## A suggested decision**\n\n*Reject* – While the work addresses an important gap and presents a promising dataset, the current manuscript falls short in terms of novelty, methodological rigor, and comprehensive evaluation. Substantial revisions—particularly in benchmarking, ablation studies, reproducibility details, and ethical considerations—are needed before the contribution can be deemed sufficient for publication.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly integral to healthcare applications, including medical visual question answering and imaging report generation. While these models inherit the robust capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), they also inherit susceptibility to hallucinations—a significant concern in high-stakes medical contexts where the margin for error is minimal. However, currently, there are no dedicated methods or benchmarks for hallucination detection and evaluation in the medical field. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically designed for hallucination detection and evaluation within the medical multimodal domain. This benchmark provides multi-tasking hallucination support, multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization. Furthermore, we propose the MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric designed to assess LVLMs' hallucinations through a hierarchical scoring system that considers the severity and type of hallucination, thereby enabling a granular assessment of potential clinical impacts. We also present MedihallDetector, a novel Medical LVLM engineered for precise hallucination detection, which employs multitask training for hallucination detection. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish baselines for popular LVLMs using our benchmark. The findings indicate that MediHall Score provides a more nuanced understanding of hallucination impacts compared to traditional metrics and demonstrate the enhanced performance of MedihallDetector. We hope this work can significantly improve the reliability of LVLMs in medical applications. All resources of this work have been released.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a hallucination detection and evaluation benchmark in the medical multimodal domain. Recognizing that large vision-language models often inherit hallucination tendencies from foundational large-language models, the authors propose a framework for more accurate and detailed hallucination assessment in high-stakes medical applications. \nThe paper makes three primary contributions: (i) Med-HallMark, the benchmark dedicated to medical hallucination detection (ii) MediHallDetector, a hallucination detection model tailored for the medical domain; and (iii) MediHall Score, an evaluative metric designed for hallucinations of different severity and types. \nThrough extensive experiments, the paper claims that MediHall Score provides more nuanced insights than traditional metrics and that MediHallDetector enhances hallucination detection performance in medical LVLMs.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper is well-motivated in that it addresses a critical and underexplored area in medical LVLMs: detecting and evaluating hallucinations, which is crucial for ensuring safety in clinical applications. The work frames hallucination detection specifically for the medical domain. The MediHall Score introduces a nuanced metric that prioritizes clinical impact by differentiating hallucinations based on their severity and type. The ablation study of different SFT methods for training the detector also adds robustness to the study.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe paper raises several questions about primarily the soundness of evaluation and the reliability of the proposed metric (detailed in the **Questions** section). For example, the paper limits its IRG evaluation to only one domain-specific model, XrayGPT, which is problematic given that IRG tasks are where hallucination metrics are particularly valuable. Additionally, results for XrayGPT in IRG appear inconsistent with those of Minigpt-4, which was shown to underperform in traditional metrics but achieved the highest MediHall Score among all evaluated models, calling into question the reliability of the MediHall Score. The paper could have strengthened its findings by evaluating other state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as open-source, domain-specific models like BiomedGPT or Med-Flamingo, or proprietary MLLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini Pro, to validate the metric’s robustness. Finally, the experimental design lacks a thorough investigation into the role of image inputs in tuning MediHallDetector. The study could benefit from ablation studies that assess performance with and without image inputs, especially given that the image encoder and connector taken from LLaVA are frozen during training and could have introduced extra errors due to its lack of visual understanding ability. These design choices suggest that the current benchmark version may be limited in scope and could benefit from further refinement and validation.\n\n### Questions\n\n**Construction of the benchmark:**\n1. Could you elaborate on the motivation behind designing confidence-weakening and counterfactual questions beyond the \"conventional\" questions in established test sets like SLAKE and RAD-VQA? Regarding counterfactual question generation, considering the GPT model is provided with limited information (text-only, single question with its ground-truth answer), how is the quality of GPT-generated counterfactual questions and answers ensured?\n\n2. Robust evaluation of hallucinations in open-ended IRG tasks is inherently challenging, particularly due to synonymous terms (in frameworks like ICD-10, multiple expressions might refer to the same condition). Since the ground truth for open-ended IRG scenarios in this paper derives from medical reports in MIMIC and OpenI test sets, how does the evaluation framework account for potential synonyms in model responses given the limited set of 1800 images and their reports seen by MediHallDetector?\n\n3. In using LLaVA-Med to generate GT responses for Med-VQA, why not utilize the GT already provided in the dataset, given that the questions originate from an established source? For the IRG scenario, are model-generated responses also exclusively from LLaVA-Med? If so, might this narrow distribution affect the generalizability of MediHallDetector, as it is fine-tuned specifically on LLaVA-Med responses?\n\n**Experimental Design:**\n1. How much does the image come into play in tuning the MedihallDetector model? It could be necessary to ablate w./w.o. image input, especially when you freeze the image encoder and connector during training.\n\n**Results**\n1. For medical VQA tasks (Table 1), why introduce a MediHall Score when accuracy already exists as a metric for Med-VQA? Notably, XrayGPT, with an accuracy of only 0.02, has a MediHall Score of 0.36. Could this indicate potential inflation in the MediHall Score?\n\n2. For medical IRG tasks (Table 2), the results for XrayGPT as measured by MediHallDetector seem counter-intuitive compared to Minigpt-4. In the original XrayGPT study [1], Minigpt-4 was a baseline against which improvements were demonstrated using ROUGE (Table 1 in [1]). Here, XrayGPT does outperform Minigpt-4 in all conventional metrics, but in the MediHall Score, with Minigpt-4 obtaining the highest MediHall Score among evaluated models. Could this raise concerns regarding the reliability of the MediHall Score metric?\n\n3. Could you clarify why models like BLIP2, LLaVA-Med, and RadFM do not receive MediHall Scores for medical IRG tasks? Open-ended IRG tasks are particularly significant since accuracy is already used as a metric for VQA. Presently, only XrayGPT is evaluated in IRG tasks using the proposed model and metric; incorporating additional state-of-the-art models would enhance the proposed metric's robustness. For instance, open-source domain-specific models such as BiomedGPT [2] and Med-Flamingo [3], which perform well on established tasks, or widely used proprietary MLLMs like GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini Pro could be valuable benchmarks.\n\n**Typo**\n1. In Figure 2(a), “pairs” is misspelled.\n2. Could you clarify whether XrayGPT is used in constructing the benchmark? It appears in Figure 1(b) but is not referenced in section 3.4.\n\n[1] https://aclanthology.org/2024.bionlp-1.35.pdf\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17100\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15189\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nn/a",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces a benchmark and methodology for hallucination detection and evaluation in medical multimodal large vision–language models (LVLMs). Recognizing that such models often inherit hallucination tendencies from their foundational large language models, the study addresses a critical issue for clinical safety. The work presents three main components: (i) **Med-HallMark**, a benchmark dataset for medical hallucination detection; (ii) **MediHallDetector**, a detection model tailored to the medical domain; and (iii) **MediHall Score**, a metric that quantifies hallucinations by severity and type. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the authors claim that MediHall Score yields more nuanced insights than traditional metrics, while MediHallDetector improves hallucination detection performance. Overall, the paper is clearly motivated and organized, though some methodological aspects raise concerns regarding evaluation soundness and metric reliability.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Evaluation Scope and Reproducibility** – The study evaluates MediHallDetector primarily on XrayGPT for image report generation (IRG), omitting testing on other medical LVLMs. This narrow scope limits robustness and generalizability; inclusion of open-source models (e.g., BiomedGPT, Med-Flamingo) or proprietary MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini Pro) would strengthen conclusions.  \n2. **Metric Reliability** – The MediHall Score results appear inconsistent across models, notably where Minigpt-4 underperforms on traditional metrics yet achieves the highest MediHall Score. Such discrepancies raise doubts about the validity of the proposed metric and its calibration.  \n3. **Experimental Design** – The role of image input during MediHallDetector training is insufficiently explored. Since the image encoder and connector are frozen, ablation studies comparing training with and without image input would clarify their effect on performance.  \n4. **Benchmark and Question Generation** – The rationale and quality control behind confidence-weakening and counterfactual question construction should be clarified, particularly given limited textual context provided to GPT during generation.  \n5. **Ground-Truth and Evaluation Consistency** – It is unclear why generated responses from LLaVA-Med are used rather than existing ground-truth answers in datasets such as Med-VQA. Reliance on model-generated references could reduce evaluation validity and generalizability.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Address potential synonym variations in IRG responses, as medical terminology often contains equivalent expressions.  \n- In Figure 2(a), the word “pairs” is misspelled.  \n- Clarify whether XrayGPT is used in constructing the benchmark, since it appears in Figure 1(b) but not in Section 3.4.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis work tackles an important and underexplored problem in medical LVLMs and offers domain-specific tools to assess hallucinations. The benchmark, detector, and scoring metric collectively represent a useful direction toward safer clinical AI systems. However, limitations in evaluation breadth, potential unreliability of the MediHall Score, and unanswered methodological questions about data construction and image use temper the impact of the findings. Stronger validation across multiple models and refined analyses would be needed to confirm the framework’s utility.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The concept and motivation are sound, but issues of evaluation scope, metric reliability, and methodological clarity must be addressed before acceptance.",

It also proposes a metric to evaluate the severity of hallucination in LVLMs, and a fine-tuned evaluator model is released to perform the universal evaluation for given set information based on (input image I, the original prompt P, the LVLM answer A and the ground truth GT).\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper proposes a novel benchmark for evaluation the LLMs specially in the Medical domain, and provides a comprehensive framework from dataset, metric, and the fine-tuned evaluation model, which is a completed work through the evaluation pipeline.  \n●\tThe paper is writing in a smooth way, easy to follow and simple to understand.  \n●\tThe work is of good significance, should be a meaningful angle to advance the LLM/LVLMs applications in real-world healthcare domain.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n●\tThe paper did not emphasize the special challenges in Healthcare domain, after the reading, except for the first part of the dataset that involves the `Medical` multi-modality data such as CT, the evaluation process is on the common hallucination challenges from any Vision-language model, it raises the concerns that whether the proposed model stands out from common LVM hallucination evaluation, is other existing work able to solve the same question by simply adapting to the medical data? What is the advantage of the proposed fine-tuned model over other baseline methods?  \n●\tThe hierarchical definition of the MediHALL score seems a bit intuitive, which is a simple evenly scaled value on 5 categories.  \n●\tThe paper lacks discussion on the relevant work that conduct similar hallucination detection in LLMs at Healthcare domain.  \n●\tIt is suggested that the paper could make further clarification on certain questions as in the Question section, if most critical concerns can be addressed, it is plausible to raise the score for the paper’s quality evaluation.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. The authors explicitly defined 5 types of hallucination levels, among which: Catastrophic Hallucination, Critical Hallucinations, Minor Hallucination are severity levels, but the attribute, prompt-induced ones is indeed the `cause` of the hallucinations. There raise doubts of the rationale of such empirical classifications including attribute, prompt-induced to severity levels. \n \n2. As in line 215, the conventional Q_{conv} questions are generated by the GPT3.5, how is the quality guaranteed? How is the initial conv question obtained?  \n \n3. LLaVA-Med was used to infer answers, what is the size of the whole dataset? Even though the authors claim that the data has been examined, how is the quality guaranteed?   \n \n4. Also, for the dataset part that is relevant to the IRG scenario, the authors use a sampling method to draw 1,800 images and their corresponding medical reports from existing datasets: MIMIC-test and OpenI datasets. This weakens the contribution towards the data as proposed in line 065.  \n \n5. In line 255, “This fine-grained metric xxx”, starts abruptly, since the previous paragraph discusses the existing metrics drawbacks. Then it directly refers to “This metric”, which is not transitioning naturally.  \n \n6. The MediHALL score is relatively simple, which is built upon the pre-categorized types of hallucination levels and assigns different values in a hierarchical way.  Based on this, the latter human-annotation and fine-tuning are conducted, are they able to maintain the objectiveness?  \n \n7. In line 318, which directs the training data details to Figure, it explicitly shows the categories, and the types of training data covered for MEDIHALLDETECTOR, but what about the amount of the data? And how is the instruction pair data derived?  \n \n8. While the paper is positioned as the first benchmark for medical LM hallucination evaluation, there is relevant work worth referencing:  \n\n[1] MEDHALU: Hallucinations in Responses to Healthcare Queries by Large Language Models \n[2] MEDIC: TOWARDS A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING LLMS IN CLINICAL APPLICATIONS \n[3] Faithfulness Hallucination Detection in Healthcare AI\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 3",

The authors do not sufficiently emphasize challenges specific to the healthcare domain.

The work concerns multimodal machine‑learning methodology for medical image interpretation rather than a specific clinical application.  It falls within TMI’s scope of computational‐imaging methodology, particularly assessment and trustworthiness of machine‑learning systems. ✅ Proceed with full review.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution** –   \nThe authors combine three original components: (1) a curated benchmark with hierarchical hallucination labels specific to clinical severity, (2) a fine‑grained quantitative metric, and (3) a detection network trained to classify hallucination levels.  While benchmarks and evaluation metrics have appeared in general LVLM literature, adaptation to the medical domain with clinically meaningful categories appears novel.  The contribution is methodological yet primarily evaluative rather than a new imaging‑physics or reconstruction method.  Novelty is moderate.\n\n**3. Technical & Experimental Rigor** –   \nThe paper describes dataset sources, annotation workflows, and multi‑rater validation.  The methodology for question generation, hallucination taxonomy, and score calculation is clearly detailed.  Experiments cover multiple LVLM baselines with quantitative tables.  Statistical uncertainty and inter‑annotator agreement could be more fully reported; claims of superiority of MediHallDetector would benefit from statistical significance testing and clearer definitions of accuracy/recall in Table 5.

Baseline results for multiple existing LVLMs and ablation studies demonstrate feasibility and illustrate weaknesses of conventional NLP metrics in reflecting medical factuality.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Fills a clear gap: domain‑specific hallucination detection/benchmarking for medical LVLMs.  \n- Defines a clinically interpretable, hierarchical annotation scheme linking hallucination severity to diagnostic impact.  \n- Provides open resources likely to foster reproducibility and community comparison.  \n- Demonstrates comprehensive experimental coverage across model families.  \n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Novelty lies mainly in dataset design and metric engineering; limited algorithmic innovation beyond an SFT variant of existing LVLMs.  \n- Lacks quantitative statistical analysis (confidence intervals or significance testing).  \n- No external expert validation of the hierarchical severity mapping or evidence that MediHall Score correlates with clinical harm.  \n- Presentation is verbose; several results tables could be condensed.  \n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Validation of Hierarchical Labels:** Provide quantitative inter‑annotator agreement (κ statistics) to demonstrate reliability of the five‑level taxonomy.  \n2. **Statistical Significance:** Report variance and perform significance testing for improvements of MediHallDetector over baselines.  \n3. **Metric Justification:** Explain how numeric weights (0–1) in the MediHall Score were chosen and whether results are sensitive to these values.  \n4. **Generalizability:** Discuss applicability of Med‑HallMark beyond chest radiography (e.g., CT, MRI) and potential extension to non‑English datasets.  \n5. **Comparison with Prior Benchmarks:** Clarify differentiation from general hallucination datasets (CHAIR, POPE) and illustrate unique medical features beyond label granularity.  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Unify notation (e.g., “MediHallDetector” capitalization).  \n- Fix typographical inconsistencies (missing spaces and superscripts).  \n- Condense redundant dataset descriptions in main text; leave details to appendix.  \n- Ensure figures, especially Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, have legible fonts for publication.  \n- Verify IEEE reference formatting.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation** – **Major Revision**   \nThe study is methodologically important and well executed but primarily proposes a benchmark; to meet TMI’s methodological‑rigor expectations the paper requires clearer quantitative validation, succinct presentation, and evidence of the metric’s clinical relevance.\n\n**7. Confidence Level** – 4 / 5 (High)  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgement:** This submission introduces valuable resources for evaluating hallucinations in medical multimodal models—a timely and relevant contribution for trustworthy medical imaging AI.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses hallucination detection in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) within medical contexts by introducing three main contributions. First, Med-HallMark is presented as the first benchmark for medical multimodal hallucination detection, supporting both Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) and Imaging Report Generation (IRG) tasks with hierarchical categorization of hallucinations into five severity levels (Section 3). Second, MediHall Score is proposed as a domain-specific evaluation metric that assigns scores based on hallucination severity (Section 4). Third, MediHallDetector is developed as a specialized model for detecting medical hallucinations through supervised fine-tuning (Section 5). The benchmark encompasses 7,341 samples across conventional, confidence-weakening, counterfactual, and image depiction questions (Figure 1). Experimental results demonstrate that existing LVLMs exhibit significant hallucination rates, with the proposed MediHall Score providing more nuanced assessment compared to traditional metrics (Tables 1-2).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Insufficient mathematical rigor in metric formulation**\n  - The MediHall Score calculation lacks formal mathematical notation and precision (Section 4, lines 270-275). The averaging formula Hoverall = 1/k Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ Hᵢ oversimplifies complex hierarchical relationships between different hallucination types.\n  - Score assignments (Hc = 0.0, Hcr = 0.2, etc.) appear arbitrary without statistical justification or sensitivity analysis supporting these specific values.\n  - No confidence intervals or uncertainty quantification is provided for the proposed metric, limiting its statistical interpretability in clinical contexts.\n\n• **Limited scope and generalizability of benchmark construction**\n  - The dataset relies heavily on only four source datasets (SLAKE, VQA-RAD, MIMIC, OpenI) as stated in Section 3.4, potentially limiting diversity of medical conditions and imaging modalities.\n  - The hierarchical categorization system is developed with assistance from \"experienced clinicians\" (Section 3.3) but lacks details on inter-annotator agreement, annotation guidelines, or validation across different medical specialties.\n  - GPT-based augmentation for expanding questions (Section 3.4, lines 225-227) may introduce systematic biases that are not adequately controlled or measured.\n\n• **Inadequate experimental validation and baseline comparisons**\n  - The evaluation of MediHallDetector against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is limited to only 300 samples (Section 6.3), which may not provide sufficient statistical power for robust conclusions.\n  - Missing comparisons with other specialized medical hallucination detection methods, as the paper claims to be \"the first\" but does not adequately survey related work in medical AI safety.\n  - Tables 1-2 show inconsistent performance patterns across models without adequate statistical significance testing or error bars to support the claimed superiority of the proposed approach.\n\n• **Questionable clinical relevance and practical applicability**\n  - The paper lacks validation from actual clinical practitioners beyond the initial annotation phase, limiting evidence of real-world utility (no direct evidence found in the manuscript for clinical validation).\n  - The five-level hierarchical categorization system may be too complex for practical clinical implementation, as evidenced by the low consistency rates of even advanced models like GPT-4 (Figure 2b shows only 76.19% consistency).\n  - No discussion of computational costs, inference time, or scalability considerations for deployment in clinical settings where real-time performance is crucial.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical formulation and statistical rigor**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definitions with proper notation for all components of the MediHall Score, including explicit handling of edge cases and missing data scenarios.\n  - Conduct sensitivity analysis to justify the specific score assignments and demonstrate robustness to parameter variations through systematic experimentation.\n  - Include confidence intervals and statistical significance testing for all metric comparisons, with appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons.\n\n• **Expand benchmark diversity and validation methodology**\n  - Include additional medical imaging datasets from different institutions and geographical regions to improve generalizability and reduce potential dataset bias.\n  - Provide detailed inter-annotator agreement statistics (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa) and establish clear annotation protocols that can be replicated by other research groups.\n  - Replace or supplement GPT-based augmentation with human-generated questions to eliminate potential systematic biases in question formulation.\n\n• **Strengthen experimental design and comparative analysis**\n  - Expand the evaluation dataset to at least 1,000-2,000 samples with stratification across different medical conditions and hallucination types for more robust statistical analysis.\n  - Include comparisons with domain-adapted versions of existing hallucination detection methods and general-purpose fact-checking systems applied to medical contexts.\n  - Report statistical significance tests, effect sizes, and confidence intervals for all performance comparisons, with proper correction for multiple hypothesis testing.\n\n• **Validate clinical utility and practical deployment considerations**\n  - Conduct user studies with practicing radiologists and clinicians to evaluate the practical utility and interpretability of the proposed hierarchical categorization system.\n  - Simplify the categorization system based on clinical feedback, potentially reducing to 3-4 levels that align better with clinical decision-making workflows.\n  - Include comprehensive analysis of computational requirements, inference latency, and scalability metrics to demonstrate feasibility for clinical deployment scenarios.",

It introduces three main contributions: (1) **Med-HallMark**, the first benchmark for multimodal medical hallucination detection spanning Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) and Imaging Report Generation (IRG) tasks, structured with five severity levels of hallucination; (2) **MediHall Score**, a domain-specific evaluation metric quantifying hallucination severity; and (3) **MediHallDetector**, a fine-tuned model for hallucination identification. The study analyzes 7,341 benchmark samples and reports that existing LVLMs exhibit significant hallucination rates, with MediHall Score offering finer granularity than standard metrics. The paper is ambitious and relevant but exhibits methodological and validation deficiencies that limit confidence in its results and clinical relevance.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Mathematical and Statistical Rigor**: The MediHall Score formulation lacks formal notation and statistical justification. Averaging across hallucination levels (H_overall = 1/k Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ Hᵢ) fails to capture hierarchical complexity, while the assigned severity scores appear arbitrary. No uncertainty quantification or confidence intervals are provided, restricting interpretability.  \n2. **Dataset Scope and Benchmark Validity**: The benchmark draws from only four medical datasets, limiting diversity of pathologies and imaging modalities. Details on clinician annotation, including inter-annotator agreement and protocol standardization, are missing. GPT-driven data augmentation may introduce uncontrolled biases.  \n3. **Experimental Design and Baseline Comparisons**: Evaluation is confined to 300 samples, which likely lacks statistical robustness. Comparisons focus mainly on GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, omitting other medical hallucination detection baselines. Reported results lack significance testing or variability measures.  \n4. **Clinical Relevance and Practical Utility**: The study does not involve clinical validation beyond the annotation stage. The five-level hierarchy may be overly granular, and the paper omits discussion of computational efficiency or scalability for real-world clinical use.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify mathematical notation in Section 4 and align terminology across figures and tables.  \n- Provide explicit references for datasets and describe augmentation methodology with reproducibility details.  \n- Indicate any code or data availability statements to enhance replicability.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper introduces an important initiative toward standardized benchmarks and metrics for hallucination detection in medical LVLMs. Nonetheless, its mathematical formulation, experimental scope, and clinical validation are underdeveloped. Broader datasets, more rigorous statistical testing, and practical deployment analyses would increase its impact and credibility. With substantial methodological and validation revisions, the work could make a stronger contribution.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**: **Major Revision**",

        "text": "## DETECTING AND EVALUATING MEDICAL HALLUCINATIONS IN LARGE VISION LANGUAGE MODELS\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper introduces Med-HallMark, a benchmark for detecting and evaluating hallucinations in medical LVLMs spanning Med-VQA and imaging report generation (IRG); MediHall Score, a severity-aware metric that scores hallucination impact via a five-level hierarchy; and MediHallDetector, an LVLM-based detector fine-tuned to classify hallucination categories from image, prompt, answer, and ground-truth inputs. The authors annotate responses at utterance- (VQA) and sentence-level (IRG) with a clinician-defined hierarchy (Catastrophic → Minor), establish baselines for several popular LVLMs, and report that MediHallDetector is more consistent and faster than GPT-3.5/4 at hallucination categorization.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationA severity-based, clinician-informed hierarchy for medical hallucinations that goes beyond object/attribute-only definitions common in general-domain LVLMs.A benchmark spanning both fine-grained VQA and long-form IRG with sentence-level annotations, enabling multi-granular analysis.A unified scoring scheme (MediHall Score) that aggregates hallucination categories into interpretable numeric scores for both short and long outputs.A specialized detection model (MediHallDetector) trained with multi-task data and instructions to classify hallucination categories.\n- Experimental rigor and validationBroad baseline coverage including multiple generalist and medical LVLMs across both VQA and IRG tasks using a suite of standard NLG metrics plus MediHall Score.Clinician involvement in the annotation loop for quality assurance and resolution of disagreements.Ablation over different data configurations for detector training, and speed/consistency comparisons against GPT-3.5/4.\n- Clarity of presentationClear articulation of the taxonomy, data construction pipeline, and the division between VQA vs IRG settings.Illustrative examples that show how different metrics (ROUGE/BLEU/BERTScore) can misalign with factuality and how the proposed score responds.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a safety-critical gap in medical multimodal evaluation—hallucination detection beyond shallow text overlap—by providing a task-rich benchmark and a severity-aligned metric.Practicality for the community if resources are indeed released: a benchmark, metric definition, and a trained detector tailored to medical outputs.\n\n- A severity-based, clinician-informed hierarchy for medical hallucinations that goes beyond object/attribute-only definitions common in general-domain LVLMs.\n- A benchmark spanning both fine-grained VQA and long-form IRG with sentence-level annotations, enabling multi-granular analysis.\n- A unified scoring scheme (MediHall Score) that aggregates hallucination categories into interpretable numeric scores for both short and long outputs.\n- A specialized detection model (MediHallDetector) trained with multi-task data and instructions to classify hallucination categories.\n\n- Broad baseline coverage including multiple generalist and medical LVLMs across both VQA and IRG tasks using a suite of standard NLG metrics plus MediHall Score.\n- Clinician involvement in the annotation loop for quality assurance and resolution of disagreements.\n- Ablation over different data configurations for detector training, and speed/consistency comparisons against GPT-3.5/4.\n\n- Clear articulation of the taxonomy, data construction pipeline, and the division between VQA vs IRG settings.\n- Illustrative examples that show how different metrics (ROUGE/BLEU/BERTScore) can misalign with factuality and how the proposed score responds.\n\n- Addresses a safety-critical gap in medical multimodal evaluation—hallucination detection beyond shallow text overlap—by providing a task-rich benchmark and a severity-aligned metric.\n- Practicality for the community if resources are indeed released: a benchmark, metric definition, and a trained detector tailored to medical outputs.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe detector formulation explicitly requires ground truth as an input (I, P, A, GT), which limits utility in real-world deployment where GT is unavailable; this positions MediHallDetector more as an evaluator than a detector for live use.MediHall Score relies on a discrete set of handpicked weights (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) without sensitivity analysis or external validation against clinician risk ratings; the mapping from category to clinical risk is plausible but uncalibrated.Dataset construction partially bootstraps from LVLM-generated answers and GPT-based rewriting/counterfactual generation, risking style bias and confirming patterns that detectors may implicitly learn to recognize rather than true medical errors.The method description for MediHallDetector lacks architectural and training detail (loss formulation, label formats, handling of long IRG inputs, class imbalance), and the ablation table includes confusing or unscaled values.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesNo inter-annotator agreement statistics (e.g., κ) are reported despite multiple rounds of clinician review, making label reliability difficult to assess.Possible circularity: parts of the evaluation of models via MediHall Score seem to lean on detector predictions; it is unclear when human labels vs detector-derived labels are used for scoring, which affects the fairness of comparisons.Limited modality scope in IRG (CXR-dominant) and unclear distributional diversity in VQA; no out-of-distribution or cross-modality generalization tests.Absence of significance testing, calibration analysis, or correlation of MediHall Score with blinded clinician risk/severity judgments to validate metric fidelity.Several baselines are reported as “not suitable” for IRG MediHall Score due to generation format; it should be possible to sentence-segment any textual output and score it consistently.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSome tables contain clearly erroneous or inconsistent numbers (e.g., ROUGE-1 = 91.17 for a weak baseline; units and decimals are inconsistent in ablations) and figures/tables include artifacts from PDF extraction.The scoring equation for IRG is truncated mid-sentence in the text; training details in the supplement are referenced but not summarized.The rationale for category boundaries and concrete annotation guidelines are summarized but not operationalized with edge-case examples or decision checklists.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsRecent and closely related efforts are not cited or compared: MedHEval (cause-driven medical hallucination benchmark), HEAL-MedVQA (large Med-VQA benchmark with grounding and robustness protocols), Gut-VLM (sentence-level hallucination tags and correction on endoscopy), reference-free detectors like SUQ probes, and tool-augmented detection frameworks like UNIHD.

However, the severity mapping needs validation and clearer annotation protocols to ensure consistent application across annotators and tasks.Requiring ground truth for MediHallDetector limits its description as a “detector”; it is more accurately a supervised evaluator. For clinical deployment or pre-release screening, a reference-free or retrieval-augmented variant would be essential.The metric’s discrete weights are intuitive but arbitrary. A sensitivity analysis (vary weights, or learn them from clinician preference data) and a correlation study with independent clinician risk ratings would strengthen claims.Mixing training signals from general task data, benchmark labels, and instruction pairs is sensible. Yet, critical details (loss functions, negative sampling, class imbalance handling, sentence segmentation for IRG, temperature/decoding strategies for detector outputs) are missing; ablations are hard to interpret due to unit inconsistencies and vague method descriptors (a–f).\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentBaselines span many popular LVLMs, which is valuable. However, some metrics appear implausible (e.g., very high ROUGE-1 for a poor model), suggesting preprocessing or reporting errors.The decision to omit MediHall Score for some IRG outputs due to “format” is weak—sentence segmentation is generally feasible; a uniform segmentation policy should be applied for fairness.The speed/consistency comparison with GPT-3.5/4 is useful but lacks methodological detail (number of items, prompt templates, and exact metric of “consistency”), and does not include open, research-grade detectors as additional baselines.No robustness analyses (e.g., when IRG reports include benign but uninformative content, distribution shifts, different imaging modalities, or degraded image quality) are reported; related work shows these factors strongly affect detection performance.Statistical significance and effect sizes are absent. Given modest differences in MediHall Score across models for VQA, confidence intervals would help.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)MedHEval emphasizes cause-driven taxonomy and evaluates mitigation strategies across modalities and contexts; this paper’s severity-based taxonomy is complementary but should acknowledge MedHEval and clarify differences (severity vs cause), dataset scale, and task coverage.HEAL-MedVQA contributes a large Med-VQA dataset with grounding and robustness protocols (textual/visual perturbations) and a localize-before-answer approach that reduces hallucination; incorporating HEAL’s protocols or reporting performance on HEAL would improve external validity.Gut-VLM conducts sentence-level hallucination detection and correction on endoscopy; while the modality differs, it is a closely aligned task and demonstrates a practical detection-and-correction training paradigm that this work could compare to or adopt in IRG settings.Reference-free detection studies (e.g., SUQ probes) and tool-augmented detection (UNIHD) report strong performance in general domains; including a medical adaptation or at least discussion/limitations would prevent over-claiming about the superiority of MediHallDetector.CoMT (chain-of-medical-thought) shows that structured supervision reduces hallucinations and uses a MediHall-like scoring; benchmarking the proposed measure against CoMT’s evaluation protocols or correlating with their human assessments would strengthen external alignment.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceA severity-aware metric and benchmark can help the community move beyond surface metrics toward safety-relevant evaluation, which is highly valuable in clinical AI.Risks include over-reliance on detector scores that are trained on benchmark-specific distributions, potential biases introduced by GPT-assisted data construction, and the mismatch between evaluator-with-GT vs real-world detector use cases.If curated and maintained well (with transparent annotation protocols, IAA reporting, external validation, and broader modalities), Med-HallMark could become a standard resource for medical LVLM safety evaluation.\n\n- The hierarchical taxonomy is medically motivated and arguably more actionable than object-only taxonomies.

If so, do you have a reference-free variant or retrieval-augmented alternative for real-world deployment where GT is absent?\n- What are the inter-annotator agreement statistics (e.g., Cohen’s/Fleiss’ κ) for hallucination category labels at utterance- and sentence-level? How often did the lead clinician override disagreements?\n- How were the MediHall Score weights chosen for each severity level? Did you conduct sensitivity analyses or collect clinician preference data correlating categories with clinical risk to justify the weighting?\n- For the baseline results reported with MediHall Score, did you use human annotations or MediHallDetector predictions? If the latter, how do you avoid circularity when comparing MediHallDetector to other models?\n- How did you prevent training–test leakage between the detector’s SFT data and the benchmark’s evaluation set, given you mix “Med-HallMark data” into detector training?\n- Why are MediHall Scores omitted for IRG outputs from some models due to “generation format”? Can you standardize sentence segmentation and apply the same scoring pipeline to all models?\n- Beyond CXR and the datasets used (SLAKE, VQA-RAD, MIMIC, OpenI), do you plan to include other modalities (CT, MRI, ultrasound) and clinical domains? What is the current modality/pathology distribution?\n- Can you provide detailed training settings for MediHallDetector (losses, label encoding, class weights/imbalance handling, tokenization/segmentation for IRG) and release code/checkpoints to ensure reproducibility?\n- Have you validated that MediHall Score correlates with blinded clinician assessments of clinical risk/harm for generated reports? If so, please report correlation or agreement statistics.\n- Several tables contain values that appear erroneous or unit-inconsistent (e.g., ROUGE-1 ≈ 91, ablation ACC/Recall units). Can you audit and correct these numbers and clarify metric scaling?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper addresses an important and underexplored problem: how to detect and quantify clinically meaningful hallucinations in medical LVLM outputs. The proposed benchmark, severity-aware metric, and dedicated detector constitute a useful package that can push evaluation beyond shallow text overlap. The taxonomy is intuitive and clinician-informed, the dataset spans both VQA and IRG with granular labels, and the experiments cover many popular LVLMs. However, several core aspects need strengthening before publication at a top venue: (i) the detector’s reliance on ground truth limits its practical detection utility; (ii) the MediHall Score weights and category boundaries lack validation and sensitivity analysis; (iii) inter-annotator agreement and leakage controls are not reported; (iv) comparisons miss closely related, recent medical hallucination benchmarks and detection methods; and (v) parts of the empirical reporting appear inconsistent or error-prone. With clearer methodological details, reliability measures, external validation (e.g., correlation with clinical risk ratings), broader modality coverage, and head-to-head comparisons against contemporary medical hallucination resources and detectors, this work could become a valuable reference point for the community.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents *Med-HallMark*, a comprehensive benchmark for detecting and evaluating hallucinations in medical large vision–language models (LVLMs). It introduces three core components: a clinician-informed hierarchical taxonomy of hallucination severity, the *MediHall Score* for quantifying hallucination impact, and the *MediHallDetector*, a fine-tuned LVLM designed to classify hallucination categories using multimodal and textual inputs. The work spans both medical VQA and imaging report generation tasks, includes multi-level clinician annotation, and compares multiple baseline LVLMs. Overall, the paper is clearly written and addresses a critical gap in safety-centered evaluation for medical AI, though several technical, methodological, and reporting issues limit its current robustness and generalizability.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Detector and Metric Design** – The *MediHallDetector* requires ground truth input, which restricts its use to evaluation rather than real-world detection. The *MediHall Score* relies on unvalidated, manually chosen weights; no sensitivity or clinician risk calibration analyses are provided.  \n2. **Dataset and Training Details** – The benchmark partially uses LVLM- and GPT-generated text, potentially introducing stylistic bias. Key detector specifications (architecture, loss functions, class imbalance handling, IRG segmentation) are underdescribed, and reported ablations contain unscaled or inconsistent metrics.  \n3. **Annotation and Evaluation Reliability** – No inter-annotator agreement is reported despite multi-clinician labeling. It is unclear when human versus detector labels are applied in scoring, creating potential circularity. Significant testing, calibration, and external validation (e.g., correlation with clinician harm ratings) are missing.  \n4. **Scope and Comparisons** – The dataset is CXR-dominant with limited modality diversity.

Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical problem of hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) when applied to medical contexts, where such errors can have serious clinical consequences. The authors identify a significant gap in the field: while hallucination detection has received attention in general LVLM research, no dedicated methods or benchmarks exist for the medical domain. To bridge this gap, the authors introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically designed for medical hallucination detection that provides multi-task hallucination support, multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization. They also propose MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric that assesses hallucinations through a severity-based hierarchical scoring system, and MediHallDetector, a novel medical LVLM engineered for precise hallucination detection. Through extensive experimental evaluations, the authors establish baselines for popular LVLMs, demonstrating that MediHall Score provides a more nuanced understanding of hallucination impacts compared to traditional metrics and that MediHallDetector significantly outperforms general-purpose models like GPT-4 in hallucination detection tasks. The work represents a foundational contribution to ensuring the reliability of LVLMs in high-stakes medical applications.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper addresses a critical and previously neglected problem in medical AI, where hallucinations can have serious clinical consequences. This represents a significant contribution to the field.\n- The hierarchical hallucination categorization is particularly valuable, moving beyond technical classifications to consider clinical severity and impact on decision-making, which better aligns with medical needs.\n- The Med-HallMark benchmark is well-constructed with thoughtful multi-task support, diverse question types (conventional, confidence-weakening, counterfactual), and thorough annotation that addresses limitations of existing medical benchmarks.\n- The MediHall Score effectively addresses a key limitation of traditional metrics by distinguishing between different severity levels of hallucinations, providing clinically meaningful evaluation.\n- The MediHallDetector model demonstrates clear superiority over general-purpose models in hallucination detection, with rigorous ablation studies supporting the design choices.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The clinical validation of the hallucination categorization system is insufficient. While clinicians assisted in creating the categories, there's no evidence of validation with practicing clinicians regarding how these categories actually impact real-world medical decisions.\n- The benchmark focuses almost exclusively on radiology (X-rays, CT scans), with limited representation of other medical imaging modalities like MRI, ultrasound, or pathology slides, limiting the approach's generalizability to broader medical contexts.\n- The paper lacks assessment of how these hallucinations would impact actual clinical workflows or patient outcomes, making it difficult to fully evaluate the importance of the different hallucination categories in practice.\n- The English-only limitation significantly restricts the practical applicability of the tools, as medical practice occurs in many languages globally.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The presentation of hierarchical categorization with clear examples is accessible to both technical and medical readers.\n- The comprehensive experimental setup with various question types provides a thorough evaluation of model robustness.\n- The authors' commitment to reproducibility through resource release and detailed methodological documentation is commendable.\n- The comparison between different models across multiple dimensions (inference time, consistency, accuracy) provides valuable practical insights.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The paper could better address how ambiguous cases (where medical experts might disagree on interpretation) would be handled within the hallucination framework.\n- There's no comparison to human performance on the hallucination detection tasks, which would provide a meaningful baseline.\n- Some results are presented in the main paper while others are relegated to the appendix, making the narrative flow less cohesive.\n- The use of GPT-4 for creating counterfactual questions may introduce bias, as GPT-4 itself can hallucinate.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Summary\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a critical safety issue in medical AI with direct implications for patient care. As LVLMs become more integrated into healthcare, ensuring their reliability is paramount. The paper establishes foundational tools for hallucination detection in medical contexts, making it highly significant. However, the narrow focus on radiology somewhat limits the breadth of impact.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper is highly innovative in creating the first medical hallucination-specific benchmark and evaluation framework. The hierarchical categorization of hallucinations by clinical severity rather than technical characteristics represents a novel approach that better serves medical needs. The dedicated hallucination detection model also introduces a new direction in medical AI safety research.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is thorough in comparing multiple models across various metrics and question types, with strong ablation studies for the detector. However, the lack of clinical validation and real-world impact assessment weakens the evaluation. The comparison to human performance on hallucination detection would have strengthened the methodology.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The authors have made significant efforts toward reproducibility by releasing resources and providing detailed information about data construction and model training. The appendix includes comprehensive details about benchmark construction and experimental setup, meeting TMI's high standards for reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision (Reject/Resubmit)**\n\nThis paper makes a significant contribution to an important and underexplored area of medical AI safety. The foundational nature of the work—establishing the first medical hallucination benchmark and evaluation framework—makes it a valuable addition to the field. However, the current version has limitations that need to be addressed before publication.\n\nThe authors should:\n1. Expand the discussion of clinical validation, providing evidence of how the hallucination categories were validated with practicing clinicians for real-world relevance\n2. Address the narrow focus on radiology by either expanding the benchmark to include other modalities or more clearly articulating the scope limitations\n3. Strengthen the discussion of how hallucination severity maps to clinical impact with input from medical professionals\n4. Expand the future work section to address the language limitation more comprehensively\n\nThese revisions would significantly strengthen an already valuable contribution to ensuring the safety and reliability of AI in medical applications. The work has strong potential to become a foundational reference in the field once these concerns are adequately addressed.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThe authors tackle the problem of hallucinations in large vision‑language models (LVLMs) used for medical tasks, where erroneous outputs may have serious clinical ramifications. To address this, they introduce a benchmark called Med‑HallMark that includes medical visual‑question‑answering and imaging‑report generation tasks, supporting both open‑ended and closed‑ended formats. The benchmark categorises hallucinations into five hierarchical severity levels. Based on this taxonomy, they propose a new metric, the MediHall Score, which assigns numeric values according to the identified hallucination category for each response. They also present a detection model, MediHallDetector, trained with multitask supervision on conventional medical vision‑language data, Med‑HallMark instances, and hallucination‑focused instruction pairs. Baseline experiments on several existing LVLMs are reported to illustrate the benchmark’s utility and the detector’s purported advantage over standard metrics in recognising different hallucination types.  \n\n---\n\n**## General feedback**  \n\n- **Significance:** The manuscript correctly points out that hallucinations in medical LVLMs can lead to unsafe clinical decisions, and a domain‑specific benchmark together with a dedicated metric does fill an evident gap (Abstract; Sec 3).  \n- **Innovation:** The hierarchical hallucination taxonomy and the MediHall Score are presented as novel adaptations for medical text generation (Fig 1c, Sec 4). In practice, however, the taxonomy largely reproduces existing object/attribute/relational categories with added severity labels, and the authors provide no empirical evidence that these severity levels correspond to clinically meaningful distinctions.  \n- **Evaluation:** Extensive baseline results are shown (Tables 1‑4, 6‑8) along with a human‑agreement study (Fig 2b,c). Yet the paper lacks statistical significance testing, clear definitions of “agreement,” and any correlation analysis between the MediHall Score and established metrics, which weakens the claim of improvement.  \n- **Reproducibility:** Although the authors state that code and data are open‑source, they omit URLs, versioning information, and licensing terms. Crucial hyper‑parameters (e.g., batch size, data splits, prompting templates) are relegated to the supplement (Sec 5, App A.2‑A.3), making replication less straightforward.  \n\n---\n\n**## Specific comments/critiques**  \n\n- The benchmark is limited to English texts; there is no discussion of multilingual applicability (A.6) or strategies to mitigate this limitation.  \n- Confidence‑weakening prefixes are manually crafted (Fig 4) but the manuscript does not quantify their effect on model confidence or output quality.  \n- Counter‑factual questions are generated by GPT‑4 without grounding in the associated images (Fig 5). The proportion of automatically generated versus human‑curated items is unclear, raising concerns about annotation reliability.  \n- The hierarchical score intervals (e.g., catastrophic = 0.0–0.2, critical = 0.2–0.4, …) are presented without justification linking them to clinical risk, and no validation against radiologist judgments is provided (Sec 4).  \n- Comparisons with GPT‑3.5/4 (Fig 2c) are based on only 300 inferences and lack statistical testing; confidence intervals for the reported 93.88 % consistency are absent.  \n- The ablation study (Table 5) reports accuracy and recall for each hallucination type but omits precision, F1, and uncertainty estimates, limiting insight into trade‑offs.  \n- Details of the dataset split (training/validation/test) for Med‑HallMark are not explicitly described (Sec 3.4), hindering reproducibility.  \n- Tables 1‑4 mix traditional metrics with the MediHall Score yet provide no correlation analyses to demonstrate that the new score captures hallucination severity more effectively than BLEU, ROUGE, or BERTScore.  \n- The ethical statement claims “no new user research” while also mentioning a “double‑blind restriction” that prevents submission of ethics approvals; this inconsistency requires clarification (Sec D).  \n\n---\n\n**## A suggested decision**  \n\n**Major Revision**  \n\nThe work addresses an important problem and introduces potentially useful resources, but substantial methodological and reporting issues need to be resolved before the manuscript can be considered for publication.",

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses this limitation by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data alongside limited labeled samples. The Mean Teacher model, a prominent SSL method, enhances performance by employing an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student model to form a teacher model, where the EMA decay coefficient is critical. However, using a fixed coefficient fails to adapt to the evolving training dynamics, potentially restricting the model's effectiveness. In this paper,\nwe propose Meta MeanTeacher, a novel framework that integrates meta-learning to dynamically adjust the EMA decay coefficient during training.

DDM heuristically learns the optimal EMA decay coefficient by taking the losses of the student and teacher networks as inputs and updating it through pseudo-gradient descent on a meta-objective. This dynamic adjustment allows the teacher model to more effectively guide the student as training progresses.\nExperiments on two datasets with different modalities, i.e., CT and MRI, show that Meta MeanTeacher consistently outperforms traditional Mean Teacher methods with fixed EMA coefficients.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe paper introduces the Meta Mean Teacher framework, a novel approach to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Traditional Mean Teacher models use a fixed Exponential Moving Average (EMA) decay coefficient to update the teacher model, but this fixed value often limits model effectiveness. Meta Mean Teacher addresses this limitation by introducing a Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module that adaptively adjusts the EMA decay coefficient based on training dynamics. This dynamic adjustment optimizes the student-teacher learning process, enabling better performance in tasks with limited labeled data.\n\nKey contributions of this work include:\n\n1. Adaptive EMA Decay: The DDM module optimizes the EMA decay coefficient, enhancing the model's adaptability and enabling it to capture richer training representations.\n2. Plug-and-Play Architecture: Meta Mean Teacher is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing models, improving performance across various Mean Teacher-based methods.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. Dynamic Adaptability: By incorporating the Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module, the framework dynamically adjusts the EMA decay coefficient (α) during training. This adaptability ensures that the teacher model evolves effectively with the student model, allowing more precise guidance as training progresses. This approach addresses a common limitation in fixed-coefficient Mean Teacher models, which often fail to account for varying training dynamics.\n\n2. Plug-and-Play Module: The Meta Mean Teacher framework is designed as a modular system, making it highly compatible with existing models based on the Mean Teacher architecture. This modularity allows easy integration into various semi-supervised frameworks like UA-MT, AD-MT, and PMT.\n\n3. Enhanced Stability and Robustness: The framework benefits from the Mean Teacher method’s inherent stability due to EMA but improves upon it by learning an optimal decay coefficient through meta-learning techniques.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. High Computational Overhead: The adaptive EMA adjustment via DDM introduces complexity and requires more computational resources. The dynamic adjustment process, which includes cloning and iterative updates of both teacher and student models, may not be feasible for real-time or resource-limited applications, especially when processing large 3D medical imaging data.\n\n2. Limited Exploration of Other Adaptive Techniques: While the paper focuses on dynamically adjusting the EMA decay coefficient, other hyperparameters (like learning rates or loss weight factors) could also impact model performance in semi-supervised learning. The focus on only one parameter might restrict the overall optimization potential, as additional adjustments could further enhance the segmentation quality.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The use of fixed α in the ablation experiments in Section 4.3: In Section 4.3, why was the average fixed α method chosen for comparison? From Figure 1, we can see that lower α values ​​(such as 0.03, 0.05, and 0.1) significantly degrade the performance. In contrast, α of 0.97 achieves performance higher than 0.84. Doesn't this general average comparison seem a bit biased?\n\n3. The impact of α greater than 0.5: From Table 1, we can see that when α is greater than 0.5, its impact on performance becomes less significant. Test whether randomly selected α values ​​greater than 0.5 are beneficial, thereby potentially improving the results?\n\n4. Suspicion about the data in Section 4.4 compared with other methods: Why is your experimental setting different from that in \"Alternative Diversified Teaching of Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation\", but most of the state-of-the-art data (including LA and Pancreas-NIH datasets) are the same as the data in that paper? Does this indicate that the data is directly borrowed?\n\n5. The m symbol in Figure 2: What does \"m\" mean in Figure 2?

Unlike traditional Mean Teacher models that rely on a fixed Exponential Moving Average (EMA) decay coefficient, this approach integrates a Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module to adjust the EMA coefficient based on training dynamics. This adaptive mechanism intends to improve stability and training efficiency, particularly in settings with limited labeled data. Overall, the paper is clearly written and introduces a technically coherent methodology.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Computational Complexity:** The DDM module increases the computational burden, as its adaptive EMA adjustment requires model cloning and iterative updates for both student and teacher networks.

Exploring additional adaptive mechanisms could yield further performance gains and a more comprehensive optimization strategy.  \n3. **Experimental Clarifications:** Several points in the experimental results require clarification. Specifically:  \n   - Why does the model perform better when α=0.01, which appears inconsistent with the theoretical explanation in Section 3.1?  \n   - In Section 4.3, the choice of using the average fixed α for comparison seems biased, given that lower α values (e.g., 0.03–0.1) degrade performance while higher α (e.g., 0.97) performs better.  \n   - Table 1 suggests diminishing returns when α>0.5; the benefit of random α values above this threshold could be tested.  \n   - The experimental setup in Section 4.4 resembles that of the “Alternative Diversified Teaching” paper, though the datasets cited are identical—clarify whether data were reused or newly processed.  \n   - In Figure 2, the meaning of the “m” symbol should be explained or removed if redundant.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify notation and provide consistent symbol definitions throughout figures.  \n- Ensure all parameter values mentioned in text match those shown in tables and figures.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis work introduces a conceptually appealing adaptive extension to the Mean Teacher framework, offering improved stability and generalizability through meta-learned EMA decay. Its modular, plug-and-play design is a practical strength. However, concerns remain regarding computational cost, limited exploration of other adaptive factors, and unclear presentation of some experimental choices and data correspondences.

This paper introduces a novel meta-learning strategy to adjust the EMA decay coefficient, fully tapping into the potential of the MT semi-supervised framework.\n2. This paper introduces a strategy to adjust the EMA decay coefficient to improve semi-supervised segmentation performance, which could be a meaningful contribution to this field.\n3. The extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. I have not observed many innovative aspects in the application of meta-learning to the field of semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Part of the reason for this is the clarity of the writing; it is currently unclear what significant differences exist between the proposed DDM and previous meta-learning strategies. If there are no substantial differences, then the methodological contribution of this approach appears to be quite limited.\n2. Could the authors explain what potential drawbacks a fixed EMA decay coefficient might have on the MT framework, particularly in the context of medical image processing?\n3. The motivation is unclear. I do not understand why a dynamic change in $\\alpha$ would have a greater advantage compared to a fixed value. $\\alpha$ can be understood as the weight distribution between the teacher model’s parameters and the student model’s parameters during the iterative update process, with the teacher model’s weight being overwhelmingly dominant. I question the assumption that dynamically varying $\\alpha$ between 0.95 and 0.99 is necessarily better than a fixed value of 0.97. Could you provide a plot showing how $\\alpha$ changes dynamically over training iterations in the experiments?\n4. In Equation 2, what criteria does DDM use to derive αm? Is there a relationship between $\\alpha_m$ and these two losses? For example, if the teacher model has a lower loss, should $\\alpha_m$ be larger? Please explain.\n5. The notation in the paper is somewhat confusing. In Equation 1, what are the differences between $\\Theta_s^*$ and $\\Theta_s$, and between $\\Theta_s$ and $\\theta_s$? Additionally, what is meant by meta data $\\mathcal{D}_m$, and how does it differ from labeled data and unlabeled data? Furthermore, the $\\mathcal{L}_m$ formula is missing; I suggest adding it.\n6. What is the initial value of $\\alpha$? Has an ablation study been conducted to verify the impact of $\\alpha$?\n7. The authors mention that DDM can be promoted as a plug-and-play component for different models. However, I think DDM has limitations. For instance, how would DDM be applied to commonly used pseudo-labeling methods based on CPS (Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross Pseudo Supervision)?\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the weakness.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The approach largely modifies the existing Mean Teacher framework, and similar adaptive extensions have been reported previously.

Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript presents a methodological innovation in *semi-supervised medical image segmentation*, introducing a *meta-learned dynamic decay mechanism* for the Mean Teacher framework. The contribution squarely targets algorithmic and training methodology, relevant to TMI’s focus on methodological advances in image analysis rather than pure application studies.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe proposed *Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM)* and *Meta Mean Teacher* framework represent a conceptual and technical contribution: using meta-learning to adapt a critical hyperparameter (EMA decay) during training. While the Mean Teacher and meta-learning foundations are not new, their integration for dynamic control of the EMA coefficient is a novel idea with plausible generality. The incremental benefit (~0.5–1.5% improvement in Dice or Jaccard) is modest but consistent, demonstrating methodological value.  \n→ **Assessment:** Methodologically moderate-to-strong novelty relative to existing semi-supervised segmentation paradigms.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe experimental design includes:  \n- Comparisons on two standard 3D datasets (LA MRI, Pancreas-NIH CT).  \n- Ablation testing between fixed, teacher-guided, and student-guided DDM update strategies.  \n- Integrations into multiple Mean Teacher derivatives (UA-MT, AD-MT, PMT).  \nThe details of optimization and hyperparameters are adequately stated. However, documentation of *dataset splits*, *statistical significance of improvements*, *runtime overhead*, and *reproducibility assurances* (e.g., code sharing specifics) are limited. The theoretical justification adds conceptual clarity but remains informal—not rigorous mathematics.  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nOverall clear and fluent English with a professional structure (abstract, introduction, method, experiments). Figures and tables are informative. Minor issues: formatting glitches (e.g., subscript/superscript spacing, occasionally inconsistent symbol rendering), some sentence-level redundancy, and overlength explanations. Grammar is good but readability could be improved by tighter phrasing and clearer figure captions.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nDatasets used (LA, Pancreas-NIH) are public and anonymized. There is no mention of institutional review board (IRB) approvals or patient data handling details, but expected for public datasets. The authors *state* that code will be released upon acceptance—TMI recommends release at submission or acceptance. Reproducibility would benefit from inclusion of random seeds and precise training-validation-test partitioning.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe paper proposes *Meta Mean Teacher*, a new semi-supervised segmentation framework combining the classical Mean Teacher approach with *Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM)*. DDM employs a small meta-learned network that dynamically adjusts the exponential moving average (EMA) decay coefficient (α) between student and teacher models based on their respective losses. The authors introduce a “student-guided” meta-learning strategy, theoretically argue its advantage, and empirically validate it on two 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks (LA MRI and Pancreas CT). The approach serves as a plug-and-play extension to current Mean Teacher–style methods, yielding consistent but moderate performance improvements.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological scope relevant to semi-supervised medical image segmentation.  \n- Conceptually elegant integration of meta-learning for dynamic hyperparameter control.  \n- Broad validation across multiple MT-based architectures.  \n- Theoretical motivation clarifies underlying intuition.  \n- Demonstrated generality on multiple imaging modalities.  \n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Incremental gains: improvements are small relative to added complexity.  \n- Limited statistical analysis or robustness studies (no variance over multiple runs).  \n- Theoretical analysis is heuristic rather than formal proof-based.  \n- No exploration of runtime or computational burden of the DDM (an important consideration for practical adoption).  \n- Only two datasets; broader validation (other segmentation tasks or modalities) would strengthen claims.  \n- Reproducibility could be improved by earlier public code release and complete dataset split documentation.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Quantitative significance** – Provide variance/error bars or multiple runs to demonstrate robustness of improvements. Are observed gains statistically significant given stochastic training variance?  \n2. **Complexity analysis** – Report computational cost, training time overhead, and parameter count associated with DDM.  \n3. **Generalization** – Consider adding experiments on a different anatomical task or at least cross-validation between modalities to claim methodological generality.  \n4. **Clarity on meta-learning setup** – Expand explanation of meta-dataset selection: how is *Dm* separated from labeled/unlabeled data, and how does this affect data efficiency?  \n5. **Code and reproducibility** – Strongly recommend providing a GitHub repository link or detailed pseudocode, per TMI reproducibility policy.  \n6. **Theoretical exposition** – The current “function space” argument is qualitative. Strengthen with a clearer mathematical formulation or intuition figures.  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Fix isolated formatting errors (e.g., missing spaces in formulas and variable superscripts).  \n- In Figures 1–3, ensure high-resolution and clearer captions explaining all abbreviations.  \n- Recheck references for consistent IEEE style capitalization.  \n- Eliminate redundant sentences in Introduction (lines 056–080 overlap with Abstract).  \n- Clarify units and voxel size descriptions consistently (LA dataset section).\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The work presents a promising and conceptually novel enhancement to Mean Teacher–based semi-supervised segmentation frameworks with methodological relevance for TMI. However, the manuscript needs additional experimental rigor (statistical significance, efficiency analysis) and clearer methodological exposition to reach publishable standard.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4/5  \n(High confidence in technical assessment; moderate uncertainty about expected generalization beyond tested datasets.)\n\n---\n\n**Reviewer Summary Comment to Editor**  \nThe submission introduces an interesting meta-learning–based mechanism for dynamic teacher-student consistency adaptation, fitting within TMI’s methodology scope. The idea is novel enough to warrant consideration, though improvements are numerically small and the paper lacks some reproducibility and statistical analyses expected for an IEEE TMI-level contribution. With a strong revision focusing on experimental substantiation and presentation polish, it may reach publishable quality.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\n### This manuscript introduces Meta Mean Teacher (Meta MT), a semi-supervised learning framework designed to enhance the performance of Mean Teacher (MT) models in medical image segmentation by dynamically adjusting the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) decay coefficient. The proposed Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module uses meta-learning to adaptively determine the EMA decay coefficient based on the losses of both student and teacher models. The authors claim that this approach improves the representation capabilities of the student model, leading to better segmentation performance. The manuscript is well-written and provides detailed experimental results on two datasets (LA Heart and Pancreas-NIH), demonstrating consistent improvements over traditional MT methods.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning. While the proposed DDM module offers a novel way to dynamically adjust the EMA decay coefficient, the manuscript could benefit from a clearer distinction from existing works on dynamic hyperparameter tuning in semi-supervised learning. Specifically, the authors should highlight how their approach differs from and potentially improves upon recent methods that also employ dynamic adjustments in similar contexts.\n\n2. Evaluation Design. The evaluation is performed on two datasets with different modalities, which is commendable. However, the experiments are limited to a fixed number of iterations (6000) and a specific baseline model (VNet). The authors should consider extending the evaluation to include more diverse architectures and training conditions to validate the robustness and generalizability of their approach.\n\n3. Comparisons. The comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are thorough, but the manuscript should also include a discussion on how the proposed framework compares to other semi-supervised techniques that do not rely on the Mean Teacher framework. This would provide a more comprehensive view of the method's advantages and limitations.\n\n4. Reproducibility. Although the authors state they will release the code upon acceptance, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters used. Providing complete methodological details is crucial for ensuring reproducibility and allowing others to build upon the work.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures and Tables. Some figures (e.g., Fig. 3) are cluttered and could benefit from a more streamlined presentation, highlighting fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions to improve readability.\n   \n2. Notation and Definitions. The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is inconsistent and lacks sufficient explanation. For example, the forward operator is denoted differently in various parts of the manuscript.\n   \n3. Acronyms. Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without clear definitions, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the context.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues. There are typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7) that need to be corrected.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(Focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\nThe manuscript addresses a significant clinical challenge: improving medical image segmentation with limited labeled data. The proposed Meta Mean Teacher framework, incorporating a Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module, is a technically innovative approach to enhance the Mean Teacher model's performance. The experimental results on two datasets show consistent improvements over traditional methods, indicating the potential significance of the work. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including a broader range of datasets and models to fully establish generalizability. The reproducibility of the approach is also a concern due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, while the idea holds promise, the current evidence partially meets the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include a wider range of methods and datasets, provide complete methodological details for reproducibility, and clarify the novelty and positioning of their work relative to existing literature.",

DDM is trained with a student-guided bilevel/meta-learning objective that takes the student’s and teacher’s supervised losses as inputs to output α at each iteration. Experiments on LA (MRI) and Pancreas-NIH (CT) show consistent gains over fixed-α Mean Teacher and modest improvements when plugging DDM into MT-based methods (UA-MT, PMT, AD-MT).\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntroduces a simple, plug-and-play mechanism to adapt the EMA decay α online using a learned mapping from student/teacher loss signals.Casts α selection as a meta-learned hyperparameter within a bilevel optimization setup, which is a principled framing and aligns with recent meta-learning for hyperparameters.The student-guided meta-objective is a meaningful choice: optimize α to improve the student’s downstream supervised performance, consistent with meta-pseudo-labeling concepts.\n- Experimental rigor and validationEvaluates on two standard 3D medical segmentation datasets (LA and Pancreas-NIH) with commonly used label fractions.Tests integration into strong MT-based frameworks (UA-MT, PMT, AD-MT) and includes an ablation comparing student-guided vs teacher-guided meta-updates.Provides sensitivity evidence that α matters (Figure 1), motivating a dynamic approach.\n- Clarity of presentationPresents a pipeline diagram and an algorithmic sketch that clarify the two-phase (student-learning and meta-learning) procedure.Clearly states the role of DDM and how α is injected into EMA updates.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a widely used but under-discussed hyperparameter (EMA decay) in teacher–student semi-supervised segmentation.If robust and general, the idea could be useful broadly for MT variants in medical imaging.\n\nTechnical novelty and innovation\n\n- Introduces a simple, plug-and-play mechanism to adapt the EMA decay α online using a learned mapping from student/teacher loss signals.\n- Casts α selection as a meta-learned hyperparameter within a bilevel optimization setup, which is a principled framing and aligns with recent meta-learning for hyperparameters.\n- The student-guided meta-objective is a meaningful choice: optimize α to improve the student’s downstream supervised performance, consistent with meta-pseudo-labeling concepts.\n\nExperimental rigor and validation\n\n- Evaluates on two standard 3D medical segmentation datasets (LA and Pancreas-NIH) with commonly used label fractions.\n- Tests integration into strong MT-based frameworks (UA-MT, PMT, AD-MT) and includes an ablation comparing student-guided vs teacher-guided meta-updates.\n- Provides sensitivity evidence that α matters (Figure 1), motivating a dynamic approach.\n\nClarity of presentation\n\n- Presents a pipeline diagram and an algorithmic sketch that clarify the two-phase (student-learning and meta-learning) procedure.\n- Clearly states the role of DDM and how α is injected into EMA updates.\n\nSignificance of contributions\n\n- Addresses a widely used but under-discussed hyperparameter (EMA decay) in teacher–student semi-supervised segmentation.\n- If robust and general, the idea could be useful broadly for MT variants in medical imaging.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsMissing critical implementation details: DDM architecture (size/activations), how α is constrained to [0,1] (e.g., sigmoid/clipping), number of unrolled steps, meta-iterations per update, and how gradients are stabilized through the unrolled optimization.“Meta data” split is unspecified: size, selection strategy, and whether it reduces the already scarce labeled pool; risk of data leakage if validation/test data are inadvertently used.The theoretical analysis is informal: key claims about EMA’s “probability zero” to pass through θ* and unavoidable approximation error are not rigorous and do not reflect practical behavior (e.g., EMA as regularized ensembling rather than optimality in parameter space).\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesInconsistent improvements: several configurations with DDM degrade 95HD/ASD compared to the corresponding baseline (e.g., UA-MT+DDM on LA 5%, Pancreas 10%; PMT+DDM on Pancreas 20%; AD-MT+DDM on Pancreas 20% 95HD).

Is it a strict hold-out from the labeled set, and does its use further reduce supervision for the main training? Any risk of leakage with validation/test data?\n- How is α constrained to [0,1]? What activation or clipping do you use, and how is α initialized and regularized to avoid instability (e.g., α→1 too early)?\n- How many inner student update steps are unrolled when computing ∇_{θ^D} L_m? Do you use exact higher-order gradients or truncation/stop-gradients? What is the meta-update frequency?\n- What is the computational and memory overhead of DDM (per-iteration time, total GPU hours) relative to the baselines on LA and Pancreas?\n- At inference time you average student and teacher predictions. Did all baselines use the same ensembling? If not, can you report results without ensembling for a fair comparison?\n- Several rows show degraded 95HD/ASD with DDM (e.g., UA-MT+DDM on LA 5% and Pancreas 10%). Can you analyze failure modes and propose adjustments (e.g., boundary-aware meta-loss, uncertainty masking)?\n- How does DDM compare against simple α schedules (e.g., linear/cosine ramp-up to 0.99/0.999) and tuned schedules? Please include these as strong baselines.\n- Why did you choose to feed only supervised losses to DDM? Have you tried including unsupervised loss, teacher–student disagreement, or uncertainty as inputs?\n- How sensitive are results to the DDM architecture, learning rate, and the choice of λ? Please provide robustness analyses.\n- How does the proposed student-guided approach relate empirically and conceptually to Meta Pseudo Labels? Can you cite and contrast with MPL, and clarify the key differences in optimization target and compute?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is a timely and promising idea: dynamically meta-learning the EMA decay coefficient addresses an important but under-explored component of Mean Teacher. The plug-and-play DDM concept is attractive, and the student-guided bilevel framing is sensible. However, the current presentation lacks essential implementation and evaluation detail, contains several clarity issues and inconsistencies, and overstates claims relative to the tables (not all metrics improve, sometimes substantially worse). To be competitive at a top-tier venue, the paper needs a more rigorous and transparent experimental section (multi-seed statistics, compute overhead, stronger baselines including α schedules, ablations of DDM design), clearer positioning against closely related meta-teacher work (MPL) and recent MT variants in medical segmentation, and a tighter, more accurate narrative around when and why DDM helps. With these improvements and a refined theoretical or empirical justification of the student-guided choice, the contribution could be impactful for MT-based semi-supervised segmentation.",

        "text": "# Review Report for \"LEARNING TO TEACH: IMPROVING MEAN TEACHER IN SEMI-SUPERVISED MEDICAL IMAGE SEGMENTATION WITH DYNAMIC DECAY MODULATION\"\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThe paper addresses the critical challenge of limited labeled data in medical image segmentation by proposing a novel framework that enhances the Mean Teacher approach in semi-supervised learning. The authors identify that the fixed Exponential Moving Average (EMA) decay coefficient in traditional Mean Teacher methods fails to adapt to evolving training dynamics, potentially limiting performance. They propose Meta Mean Teacher, which incorporates a Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module that uses meta-learning to dynamically adjust the EMA decay coefficient throughout training. The DDM module takes student and teacher network losses as inputs and updates the decay coefficient through pseudo-gradient descent on a meta-objective. The authors demonstrate that their approach consistently outperforms traditional Mean Teacher methods with fixed EMA coefficients across two diverse medical datasets (LA Heart and Pancreas-NIH) with different imaging modalities (MRI and CT). Furthermore, integrating Meta Mean Teacher into state-of-the-art frameworks (UA-MT, AD-MT, PMT) achieves new state-of-the-art results, with improvements of up to 1.58% in Jaccard coefficient and significant reductions in 95HD and ASD metrics across various labeled data proportions (5%, 10%, 20%). The visualizations provided in Figure 3 clearly illustrate the segmentation quality improvements over baseline methods.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n**Major Comments:**\n\n1. **Insufficient validation of student-guided vs. teacher-guided approach:** While the paper provides a strong theoretical justification for the student-guided meta-learning approach, the empirical validation is limited to a single ablation study (Table 1) on the LA dataset. More comprehensive experiments across both datasets and different labeled data proportions would strengthen the claim that student-guided learning is consistently superior to teacher-guided learning.\n\n2. **Lack of computational complexity analysis:** The paper does not discuss the additional computational cost of the meta-learning approach compared to standard Mean Teacher methods. Since medical imaging applications often face computational constraints, understanding the training time overhead and resource requirements of the proposed method is crucial for practical implementation.\n\n3. **Incomplete comparison with state-of-the-art:** The paper claims to achieve new state-of-the-art results but does not comprehensively compare with all recent semi-supervised approaches that don't use the Mean Teacher framework. Some alternative methods may offer comparable or better performance without the added complexity of dynamic decay modulation.\n\n4. **Insufficient description of meta-dataset:** The paper lacks critical details about how the meta-dataset is selected from the training data for the meta-learning phase. This information is essential for reproducibility and understanding potential data leakage issues that might affect results.\n\n5. **Lack of insight into dynamic decay behavior:** The paper would benefit from visualizations or analysis showing how the DDM module dynamically adjusts the decay coefficient during training, which would provide deeper understanding of the method's operation and help validate the authors' claims about adapting to training dynamics.\n\n**Minor Comments:**\n\n1. The paper would benefit from additional ablation studies on the DDM module architecture (e.g., different MLP sizes, activation functions) to demonstrate the robustness of the design choices.\n\n2. The explanation of \"pseudo-gradient descent\" mechanism could be made more accessible for readers without extensive meta-learning background.\n\n3. The theoretical analysis in Section 3.2 is somewhat abstract and could be strengthened with concrete mathematical examples or visualizations.\n\n4. Figure 1's caption states it shows results on the LA Heart dataset, but the x-axis is labeled \"Weight\" without clear connection to EMA decay coefficient α, potentially causing confusion for readers.\n\n5. The discussion of limitations in Section 5 is somewhat superficial; expanding on scenarios where dynamic decay modulation might not provide benefits would strengthen the paper's credibility.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Against TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a critical problem in medical imaging—limited labeled data—which is foundational for clinical applications. The Mean Teacher framework is widely used in medical image segmentation, and improving its performance through dynamic decay modulation has high potential impact across various medical imaging domains. The demonstrated performance gains with limited labeled data directly address a key bottleneck in deploying AI in healthcare.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper presents a novel approach to dynamically adjusting the EMA decay coefficient using meta-learning, which represents a significant conceptual advance over fixed-coefficient approaches. The student-guided meta-learning strategy provides an innovative perspective on optimizing this critical parameter, and the demonstration that it outperforms teacher-guided approaches offers new theoretical insights into the Mean Teacher framework.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is comprehensive across two diverse datasets with different modalities and varying proportions of labeled data. The use of four complementary metrics (Dice, Jaccard, 95HD, ASD) provides a thorough assessment of segmentation quality. However, the meta-dataset selection process is not clearly described, and the lack of analysis showing how the decay coefficient evolves during training limits the depth of the evaluation.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides reasonable implementation details including network architecture (VNet), training parameters, and optimization settings. However, key details about the DDM module architecture and meta-dataset selection are missing, which would be necessary for exact replication. The promise to release code upon acceptance helps address this concern, but the paper should still include more methodological specifics for immediate reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision (Reject/Resubmit)**\n\nThe paper presents a valuable contribution to semi-supervised medical image segmentation with a novel approach to enhancing the Mean Teacher framework. The core idea is sound, the methodology is well-structured, and the results demonstrate consistent improvements over existing methods. However, several critical issues require substantial revision before the paper can be accepted. Specifically, the authors need to: (1) provide more comprehensive validation of the student-guided approach; (2) analyze the computational cost of their method; (3) clarify the meta-dataset selection process; (4) include visualizations of how the decay coefficient evolves during training; and (5) expand the comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Addressing these concerns would significantly strengthen the paper's contribution and ensure the claims are adequately supported by empirical evidence. I recommend major revision with the expectation that the authors can adequately address these points in a revised submission.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThis manuscript tackles the well‑known limitation of using a fixed exponential moving average (EMA) decay coefficient in Mean‑Teacher semi‑supervised segmentation of 3‑D medical images. The authors introduce **Meta Mean Teacher**, which incorporates a Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module that learns the EMA coefficient through meta‑learning based on both student and teacher losses. Experiments are performed on two volumetric datasets—a left‑atrial MRI collection (100 volumes) and a pancreatic CT set (82 volumes)—using a VNet backbone. The evaluation includes Dice, Jaccard, 95 % Hausdorff Distance and Average Surface Distance. Reported results indicate that the DDM‑augmented models achieve modest but consistent improvements (up to ~1.3 % absolute Dice gain) and reductions in distance‑based metrics compared with fixed‑α baselines. The primary contribution is a plug‑and‑play framework that adapts the EMA decay coefficient during training, thereby enhancing the teacher‑student interaction in semi‑supervised segmentation.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Relevance:** The sensitivity of the EMA decay to the dynamics of training is an important issue for semi‑supervised segmentation when only a small number of annotated 3‑D volumes are available.  \n- **Originality:** Employing meta‑learning to adapt the EMA coefficient represents a novel twist on the classic Mean‑Teacher paradigm. Although the DDM itself is a relatively simple MLP that maps loss information to a scalar, the idea of learning the decay schedule on the fly is commendable.  \n- **Experimental scope:** The authors evaluate two distinct imaging modalities and benchmark against several strong baselines, which adds confidence to the empirical claims. However, the study would benefit from reporting statistical significance, variance, and perhaps an additional external dataset to further substantiate the findings. Some reported numbers (e.g., the 95 % Hausdorff Distance for UA‑MT+DDM in Table 2) appear at odds with the described improvements and should be clarified.  \n- **Reproducibility:** While the overall methodology is clear, details concerning the DDM hyper‑parameters (architecture, learning rates, number of meta‑iterations), the construction of the meta‑dataset, and the computational overhead of the meta‑learning step are missing. Making the code available only after acceptance limits immediate verification, but providing more implementation specifics in the manuscript would greatly aid reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / suggestions for improvement  \n\n1. **DDM architecture description:** The paper states that the DDM is “a small neural network, typically an MLP,” yet it does not enumerate the number of layers, hidden units, activation functions, or total parameters (see §3.2). Adding these details would allow readers to gauge model complexity and facilitate replication.  \n\n2. **Meta‑dataset handling:** The source, size, and splitting strategy for the meta‑dataset \\(D_m\\) are not specified, leaving uncertainty about potential overlap with the primary training set (Algorithm 1). Clarifying how \\(D_m\\) is constructed and ensuring it is independent from the training data would strengthen the methodological rigor.  \n\n3. **Definition of “pseudo‑gradient descent”:** This term is introduced without a formal definition or citation in §3.1, which makes the update rule ambiguous. Providing a precise mathematical formulation or referencing prior work that employs this concept would improve reproducibility.  \n\n4. **Metric inconsistency:** In Table 2, the 95 % Hausdorff Distance for UA‑MT+DDM appears to increase from 13.71 to 25.59, contradicting the narrative of improvement. This likely reflects a typographical error; correcting the table will restore confidence in the reported results.  \n\n5. **Statistical analysis:** All tables present single mean values. Including standard deviations, confidence intervals, or results of statistical tests (e.g., paired t‑tests) would help assess whether the ≤ 1 % Dice improvements are statistically meaningful.  \n\n6. **Broader ablation study:** The current ablation compares fixed α, teacher‑guided DDM, and student‑guided DDM. Adding a baseline that uses a simple scheduled α (e.g., linear or cosine decay) would clarify whether the meta‑learning component offers a genuine advantage over conventional decay schedules.  \n\n7. **Training cost assessment:** The manuscript does not quantify the additional runtime or memory requirements introduced by the meta‑learning phase. Reporting these overheads would allow readers to evaluate the practicality of deploying the proposed method in real‑world settings.  \n\n8. **Baseline diversity:** Recent semi‑supervised approaches such as FixMatch, contrastive learning frameworks, or other dynamic‑teacher strategies are absent from the comparative study. Including these methods could provide a more comprehensive benchmark and highlight the relative strengths of Meta Mean Teacher.  \n\n9. **Code availability:** Stating that the code will be released only after acceptance limits transparency. Providing a public repository (or at least a link to a pre‑release version) would enable the community to verify and build upon the work sooner.\n\n---\n\n## Suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\n*Rationale:* While the paper addresses a pertinent problem and proposes an innovative meta‑learning based solution, the current manuscript lacks sufficient methodological detail, statistical validation, and comprehensive benchmarking to meet the journal’s standards for reproducibility and scientific rigor. Addressing the points above would greatly enhance the work’s impact and suitability for publication.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a conformal prediction based method to quantify the uncertainty for medical image segmentation. The proposed method is particularly designed for pre-trained segmentation models which notoriously make overconfident and wrong predictions. The proposed method learns thresholds using the maximum logit scores from a calibration set for the inside and outside of the ground truth masks and apply them on the logit scores of the test image to return conformalized segmentation prediction which guarantees to include the ground truth segmentation. The paper shows that naively learning the outside thresholds on max logits is not optimal and propose to transform the scores using a distance to make sure that far away pixels have lower scores. The method is validated on a single dataset for polyp segmentation and the results show that the proposed method produces conformal sets with narrower boundaries compared to using scores which are not transformed.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 1\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The idea of using transformed max logit scores is simple but quite effective strategy to produces conformal segmentation sets.\n- The presented experiments show the effectiveness of the method compared to using non-transformed logits.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1- Although I found the proposed idea of transforming max logit scores interesting, I don't think that the paper presents enough contribution to be presented in ICLR. The idea of applying conformal prediction to max logits for inside and outside of the boundaries is a direct extension of initial conformal prediction methods developed for segmentation, and applying transformations based on distance is an intuitive choice to refine predicted boundaries.\n\n2- The paper does not present any comparisons with the existing conformal prediction works for image segmentation.\n\n[1] Mossina et al. Conformal Semantic Image Segmentation: Post-hoc Quantification of Predictive Uncertainty, CVPR Workshops, 2024,\n\n3- The method is evaluated on only a single dataset. Multiple datasets should be included to make sure that the performance generalizes across datasets.\n\n4- In many segmentation tasks, we are interested in segmenting multiple structures. The paper only focuses on binary segmentation. I think the method should be validated on multi-class setting to make sure that it is also applicable in that setting.\n\n5- The explanation of how the method is applied at test time could also be clearer. As I understand it, during testing, the method applies the inner threshold on max logits to find inner boundaries, then applies a distance transformation based on each pixel’s distance from these inner boundaries, and finally applies an outer boundary threshold. However, the exact steps of the algorithm during test time need more clarification.\n\n6- In conventional uncertainty quantification algorithms for segmentation such as [2, 3] the uncertainty is quantified by the variance of the segmentation samples generated from the posterior distribution. How can the quantification be done in this case? Is it the margin between the inner and outer boundaries? Is the uncertainty quantified by the algorithm correlates with the uncertainty in the input image? For example, does the method output larger margins when there is greater disagreement between the segmentations of different experts?  \n\n[2] Kohl et al. A Probabilistic U-Net for Segmentation of Ambiguous Images\n[3] Erdil et al. MCMC Shape Sampling for Image Segmentation with Nonparametric Shape Priors\n\n7- The margin between the inner and outer boundaries appears quite large and there can be many unplausible segmentations within this area. For practical applications, an uncertainty quantification method should ideally produce a set of plausible segmentation samples within this margin, rather than simply indicating a large margin that may or may not include the ground truth segmentation. How could one obtain a plausible segmentation sample from this margin?\n\n### Questions\n\n- How does the results generalize to other datasets and segmentation of multiple structures?\n- How does the uncertainty quantified by the proposed method relates with the real uncertainty (assuming it can be measured by the disagreement between multiple experts)?\n- How one can use the proposed method in a practical application? Can we get samples of plausible segmentations within the margin outputted by the algorithm?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4",

(While I do understand that you would consider your contribution here to be in the formal derivation of underlying theory, i.e., very much the opposite of a heuristic.)\n* The experiments only provide insights into one very narrow application. they are merely fulfilling the purpose of an illustation of the problem, but not a validation.\n\n### Questions\n\n* You are testing on public data. Has your pretrained polyp segmentation algorithm been trained on the same public data? \n* Are there any susequent video frames in the dataset, or images of the same polyp / patient? If there are, did you stratify your training / testing set accordingly?  \n* Please remove the reference to tumors throughout the paper. Polyps may be precursors to tumors, but they aren't any. \n* You are using a dataset from different centers, there may be systematic differences in how the polyp areas are annotated - some annotators being more inclusive with respect to surrounding tissue, others being less. How does this variability impact on your measure? \n*  I might have missed it but what is the accuracy of your underlying segmentation algorithm? I would be under the impression that it is a well performing algorithm on a rather easy segmentation task? How does your approach relate to extrema in algorithmic performance, i.e., perfect segmentations or complete misses? \n* You are stating \"In order to make efficient use of the data available, the learning dataset can in fact contain some or all of the data used to train the image segmentor.\" Your training data may be fairly overfittet impacting on your logit score and, hence, your choice of margin (logit/distance, thresholds). Wouldn't it be a safer approach to generate cross-validated logit functions and use them in the comparison?\n* I understand that the primary contribution of this study is the theory offered. Still, you are stressing that your algorithm is a very lightweight addition to any pretrained segmentation algorithm. And there are a lot of standard computer vision / biomedical image data sets for segmentation available, as well as pretrained algorithms. Would you be able to generate segmentations maps for predefined certainty levels, and compare these levels with the testing performances across a larger set of applications? It would be quite convincing, if e.g., your 90% certainty map of the outer margin would indeed include 90% pixels of a test set or lead to a sufficiently large overlap (that has previously been defined) in 90% of all test cases.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 3\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nnone",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces a formal method for estimating uncertainty margins in image segmentation tasks. The approach involves thresholding either the logit scores or the distance from the predicted segmentation to identify uncertain regions, with the optimal threshold and margin type determined experimentally for each dataset. Experiments are demonstrated on a public dataset of still images from minimally invasive surgery. The problem addressed is relevant and the manuscript presents it in a formal and structured manner, although the experimental evaluation is limited.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Motivation and Theoretical Foundation** – The justification for the choice of scoring functions (logit vs. distance) is insufficient. The flexibility to select or combine them gives the proposed method a heuristic character, which appears contrary to the authors’ intent of providing a theoretical contribution.  \n2. **Experimental Scope and Validation** – The experiments are very limited, using only one narrow application. They serve more as an illustration than a true validation of the proposed approach.  \n3. **Training and Data Management** – Clarification is needed regarding whether the pretrained polyp segmentation algorithm was trained on the same public dataset used in testing. The authors should also specify whether there is overlap between training and test data, particularly if images of the same patient or polyp are included.  \n4. **Dataset Composition and Annotation Variability** – The influence of inter-center differences in annotation style (more or less inclusive delineation of polyp areas) on the derived uncertainty measures should be addressed.  \n5. **Baseline Performance and Overfitting** – Information is missing on the baseline segmentation accuracy. Given that the segmentation task may be relatively easy, it is unclear how the proposed measure behaves under extreme performance conditions (perfect or failed segmentations). Further, using the same data to train both the segmentor and uncertainty model risks overfitting; cross-validated logit functions might provide a safer evaluation.  \n6. **Generalizability** – Since the approach is described as lightweight and potentially adaptable, evaluation on a broader range of datasets would strengthen the empirical claims, for example by comparing predicted uncertainty levels against observed segmentation accuracy.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Remove all references to “tumors,” as polyps are not themselves tumors.  \n- Minor typographical errors and phrasing inconsistencies can be corrected for improved readability.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper addresses a relevant problem and is presented with adequate formalism. However, the methodological motivation appears weak, and the validation is restricted to a single dataset without adequate controls for overfitting or annotation bias. Broader experiments and clearer articulation of theoretical rationale would be necessary to support the claims.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – Substantial improvements in justification, experimental validation, and dataset handling are required before the work can be considered for acceptance.",

It develops a new mathematical and statistical framework for constructing spatial **conformal confidence sets** for image segmentation outputs, with theoretical coverage guarantees. This relates directly to quantitative imaging analysis and statistical image inference, fitting well within the IEEE TMI scope.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe central novelty is the *adaptation of conformal inference* to generate *spatially aware uncertainty regions* for segmentation masks, including:\n- Use of image‑level exchangeability to obtain rigorous finite‑sample guarantees.\n- Derivation of inner and outer confidence sets with probabilistic coverage of the full segmentation mask, not just pixelwise or FDR‑controlled uncertainty.\n- Introduction of *learned score transformations* (notably the distance transformation) to improve the geometric tightness of the sets.\n- Theoretical results (Theorems 2.1–2.8) linking coverage control to Hausdorff distance and bounding‑box formulations.  \nThis is a meaningful methodological advance beyond prior “pixelwise conformal” or “risk‑controlled” approaches.  \n\n3. **Technical & Experimental Rigor**  \nTheory is formally developed with proofs, assumptions stated, and multiple validation studies on independent datasets (polyps, brain, teeth). Experiments demonstrate both coverage control at nominal levels and comparative efficiency of score transformations.  \nPotential issues: limited discussion of computational complexity, sensitivity to segmenter quality, and reliance on reasonably large calibration datasets. Reproducibility seems supported through code availability.\n\n4. **Clarity & Presentation**  \nThe manuscript is generally clear and well‑structured, though mathematically dense. Figures are numerous and informative, though some legends and notations could be streamlined. Minor English style and formatting corrections would improve readability.\n\n5. **Ethical & Reproducibility Compliance**  \nAll datasets are publicly available and anonymized. The text explicitly mentions compliance and provides code for replication. No ethical concerns detected.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe authors propose a general framework for constructing conformal confidence sets that provide spatially resolved uncertainty guarantees for biomedical image segmentation. Instead of pixel‑level conformal p‑values, the method calibrates thresholds based on maxima of transformed logit scores within and outside ground‑truth masks. Distance‑based and other transformations can be learned on an auxiliary dataset to produce tight outer and inner bounds. Theoretical coverage results are proven under exchangeability. Experiments on colon‑polyp, brain‑mask, and dental CT segmentations validate finite‑sample coverage and show practical utility for uncertainty quantification.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Strong theoretical grounding with well‑defined probabilistic guarantees.  \n- Novel extension of conformal inference to spatial segmentation masks.  \n- Demonstrated generality across different imaging modalities and neural‑network backbones.  \n- Practical insights on transformation learning (e.g., distance transform) that markedly improve confidence‑set precision.  \n- Clear link to clinical uncertainty needs and easy computational implementation.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Some derivations assume ideal exchangeability and independence between segmenter and calibration data; discussion of violations (e.g., domain shift) is brief.  \n- Evaluation focuses mainly on qualitative visualizations and coverage‑rate plots; limited quantitative metrics on set tightness versus segmentation accuracy.  \n- The method’s scalability to 3‑D volumetric data is not fully evaluated.  \n- Writing densely mathematical; minor editing needed for accessibility to broader TMI readership.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Exchangeability and Independence** – elaborate on how violations (e.g., correlated calibration/test subjects, retraining same network) might affect validity, and potential remedies (weighted conformal, domain adaptation).  \n2. **3‑D and Computational Cost** – extend discussion/experiments to full volumetric data efficiency to demonstrate feasibility for standard medical‑image sizes.  \n3. **Quantitative Evaluation of Efficiency** – include standardized metrics (Dice of inner/outer bounds, average Hausdorff width) to better quantify practical informativeness.  \n4. **Transformation Learning Strategy** – clarify selection criteria, hyperparameters, and avoid any circularity when limited data are available.  \n5. **Potential Clinical Integration** – briefly discuss how these spatial uncertainty bounds could be used in downstream decision‑making or uncertainty visualization interfaces.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct small typographical and spacing errors (e.g., “polyps colonscopy,” “acheived”).  \n- Improve figure captions to be self‑contained.  \n- Consolidate repetitive references to sections/appendices for conciseness.  \n- Ensure consistent notation for α₁, α₂ across figures and text.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision**  \nThe manuscript offers significant theoretical and methodological innovation of clear relevance to TMI, but a stronger empirical section, clearer exposition of assumptions, and expanded discussion of computational/clinical aspects would materially strengthen it before publication.\n\n**7.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper develops conformal confidence sets for biomedical image segmentation that provide spatial uncertainty guarantees with probabilistic coverage. The authors adapt split-conformal inference by computing thresholds on calibration data based on the distribution of maximum transformed logit scores within and outside ground truth masks. The method constructs inner and outer confidence sets guaranteed to contain the true segmented mask with desired probability under exchangeability assumptions (Assumption 1, Section 2.1). Key theoretical contributions include marginal coverage results (Theorems 2.1-2.2), joint coverage guarantees (Theorem 2.6), and analysis of distance transformations showing improved performance when segmentation models are accurate (Theorem 2.8). The approach is validated on three biomedical datasets: polyp colonoscopy (Section 3), brain imaging (Section 4), and teeth segmentation (Section 5), demonstrating that distance transformations of predicted masks provide tighter outer confidence sets compared to raw logit scores.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical notation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - The notation switches between M̂(X) and Mˆ(X) for predicted masks without explanation (pages 2-3)\n  - Definition of sign(A,v) in distance transformation (page 5, line 252) could be clearer about boundary cases\n  - The relationship between score function s and predicted mask M̂(X) is stated as assumed but never formally defined (page 2, lines 108-109)\n\n• **Limited theoretical analysis of score transformation optimality**\n  - No theoretical guidance provided for selecting optimal transformations beyond distance transforms (Section 2.4)\n  - Theorem 2.8 only covers distance transformations but applications use other methods like smoothing (Section 5, teeth segmentation)\n  - The learning dataset approach lacks theoretical justification for when including training data is appropriate (pages 4-5, lines 216-228)\n\n• **Experimental validation limitations**\n  - Small dataset sizes limit generalizability, particularly brain imaging (524 subjects, Section 4) and teeth (598 subjects, Section 5)\n  - No comparison with existing conformal methods for image segmentation beyond brief mention of Angelopoulos et al. (2024) approach\n  - Validation procedure uses only 1000 random splits which may not capture full variability in coverage performance (Figure 4, Section 3.3)\n\n• **Insufficient analysis of computational complexity and scalability**\n  - Algorithm 1 (page 16) shows computational steps but provides no complexity analysis\n  - Runtime reported only for downscaled polyp data (0.03 seconds) with limited scalability assessment (page 10, lines 537-539)\n  - No discussion of memory requirements for large medical images or 3D volumes\n\n• **Incomplete treatment of practical implementation challenges**\n  - Limited guidance on hyperparameter selection (e.g., FWHM values for smoothing kernels in teeth application)\n  - No analysis of sensitivity to calibration set size or composition\n  - Assumption 2 (independence of scores) may be violated when learning dataset overlaps with training data but this is not addressed theoretically\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Standardize mathematical notation and improve clarity**\n  - Use consistent notation throughout (either M̂(X) or Mˆ(X)) and define all symbols upon first use\n  - Provide explicit definition of sign(A,v) with examples for boundary cases\n  - Formally define the relationship between score function s(X) and predicted mask M̂(X) in the setup section\n\n• **Develop theoretical framework for transformation selection**\n  - Provide theoretical analysis or guidelines for selecting optimal score transformations beyond distance transforms\n  - Extend theoretical results to cover smoothing and other transformations used in applications\n  - Establish formal conditions for when training data can be safely included in learning datasets without violating independence\n\n• **Strengthen experimental evaluation**\n  - Include larger datasets or multi-center validation to improve generalizability claims\n  - Add quantitative comparisons with existing conformal image segmentation methods (e.g., Mossina et al. 2024, Bates et al. 2021)\n  - Increase validation runs beyond 1000 or provide statistical analysis of coverage estimate uncertainty\n\n• **Add comprehensive computational analysis**\n  - Provide theoretical or empirical complexity analysis for all algorithmic components\n  - Include scalability experiments on larger images and 3D volumes with memory usage analysis\n  - Compare computational efficiency with alternative conformal approaches\n\n• **Enhance practical implementation guidance**\n  - Develop systematic approaches for hyperparameter selection with validation on learning datasets\n  - Analyze sensitivity to calibration set characteristics (size, distribution, quality)\n  - Address potential violations of Assumption 2 when learning and training data overlap, possibly through empirical validation or relaxed theoretical conditions",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces a novel approach for constructing conformal confidence sets for the output of black-box machine learning models used in biomedical image segmentation tasks. The method leverages conformal inference to provide spatial uncertainty guarantees, utilizing transformed logit scores and distance transformations to generate tight inner and outer confidence sets. The authors demonstrate their approach across three distinct datasets—polyps colonscopy, brain imaging, and teeth segmentation—highlighting the flexibility and applicability of their method. The manuscript is well-written and provides a thorough theoretical foundation, alongside empirical validation.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The manuscript offers a compelling contribution to the field of uncertainty quantification in image segmentation by adapting conformal inference techniques to provide spatial uncertainty guarantees. However, the novelty of the approach relative to existing literature on conformal inference for image segmentation is not fully articulated. The authors should more explicitly discuss how their method distinguishes itself from previous work, particularly in terms of the specific contributions of the distance transformations and the optimization of score transformations.\n\n2. Empirical Validation Scope: The empirical validation is conducted on three datasets, which is commendable. However, the datasets are somewhat specialized (polyps, brain imaging, teeth), and the manuscript could benefit from broader validation across a wider range of biomedical imaging tasks. Additionally, while the manuscript provides extensive validation on the datasets used, the authors should consider including more diverse types of segmentation tasks to further substantiate the generalizability of their approach.\n\n3. Reproducibility: The manuscript states that Matlab code will be provided, which is a positive step towards reproducibility. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including specifics on the preprocessing steps, model training procedures, and parameter settings. Providing a more comprehensive guide on how to reproduce the results would enhance the manuscript's utility and credibility.\n\n4. Comparison with Baselines: While the manuscript compares the proposed method against baselines such as logit scores and bounding box scores, it would be beneficial to include comparisons against more recent and sophisticated methods in the domain of uncertainty quantification for image segmentation. This would provide a clearer understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity of Figures: Some figures, such as Figure 2, are somewhat cluttered. Simplifying the presentation by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions could improve readability and clarity.\n\n2. Notation Explanation: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is dense and could be explained more thoroughly. In particular, the forward operator is denoted inconsistently, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with the terminology.\n\n3. Acronym Definitions: Several acronyms are used without definition (e.g., \"R=4\"). Defining these acronyms would improve the accessibility of the manuscript.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: There are a few typographical errors throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). These should be corrected to maintain the professionalism of the document.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in biomedical imaging: providing reliable uncertainty quantification for the output of deep learning models used in image segmentation. The proposed approach, which adapts conformal inference techniques to provide spatial uncertainty guarantees, is technically sound and potentially impactful. The theoretical foundations are robust, and the empirical validation, although somewhat limited in scope, demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the approach. However, the manuscript could benefit from broader validation and more detailed comparisons with recent methods. Reproducibility is addressed through the provision of code, but the manuscript would benefit from a more detailed description of the experimental setup. Overall, the manuscript meets many of the standards for publication in TMI but would benefit from addressing the identified limitations.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand their empirical validation to cover a broader range of biomedical imaging tasks, provide more detailed comparisons with recent methods, and enhance the reproducibility of their results through a more comprehensive description of the experimental setup.",

The core idea is to calibrate thresholds on the maxima of suitably transformed score maps inside/outside the ground-truth mask; a key practical contribution is to use distance-transformations of the predicted masks to obtain much tighter outer sets, with a theoretical link to the Hausdorff distance. The method is validated on polyp, brain, and teeth segmentation, with extensive coverage calibration on polyps and ablations on score transformations.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe formulation of inner/outer image-wise confidence sets using maxima of transformed score maps is intuitive and general, with clean conformal guarantees under exchangeability.The use of distance transforms tied to the predicted mask to create outer confidence sets is a simple, effective idea; the Hausdorff-distance–based result (Theorem 2.8) provides an appealing theoretical rationale linking segmentation accuracy and set tightness.The joint-coverage construction via either Bonferroni splitting or a joint max-statistic is a useful design choice that practitioners can tune for asymmetrical inner/outer priorities.The generalization to any increasing combination function offers a flexible path to adapt beyond the maximum.\n- Experimental rigor and validationFor polyps, the paper performs 1000 random calibration/test splits over a large held-out pool (n=1500) and reports empirical coverage curves spanning a range of confidence levels, which strongly supports nominal validity.The transformation-learning split (learning vs calibration vs test) is clearly motivated to avoid post-selection bias, and the demonstrated gains of distance transforms are consistent across examples.Efficiency analyses (diameter ratios and area-based measures) substantiate the practical benefits of specific transformations for inner vs outer sets.\n- Clarity of presentationThe conceptual distinction between inner, outer, and joint coverage is well explained, including the analogy to FWER vs FDR in multiple testing.The pipeline and the role of the learning dataset for choosing transformations are presented in a way that is actionable for practitioners.The appendices broaden the theoretical scope (increasing combination functions, risk-control view).\n- Significance of contributionsReliable, image-wise uncertainty quantification for segmentation with finite-sample guarantees is important for biomedical deployments where over/under-segmentation has clinical consequences.The proposed scheme is simple to implement, computationally lightweight, and compatible with existing black-box segmenters, which increases its potential impact.\n\n- The formulation of inner/outer image-wise confidence sets using maxima of transformed score maps is intuitive and general, with clean conformal guarantees under exchangeability.\n- The use of distance transforms tied to the predicted mask to create outer confidence sets is a simple, effective idea;

while distance transforms help, the paper could more systematically explore alternative aggregators (e.g., top-k max, spatial quantiles).Assumption 2 (independence of s, fI, fO from calibration/test data) is crucial; the text suggests the learning set can include training data, but a clearer, stricter data-separation protocol is needed to ensure no leakage into calibration/test when fine-tuning transformations.Edge cases (empty masks or full-foreground images) are not explicitly handled in the definitions of τi and γi; the maximum over an empty index set should be defined and implemented carefully to avoid invalid scores.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesBaseline comparisons miss several recent conformal segmentation approaches beyond bounding boxes and conformal risk control, including morphological dilation/erosion CP methods that require only binary masks, and spatially structured CP methods; empirical head-to-head comparisons would strengthen claims of efficiency.The brain and teeth applications are less thoroughly quantified than polyps (e.g., fewer coverage curves, fewer ablations/baselines), which makes it harder to generalize the conclusions.Calibration robustness to dataset shift is not assessed; the polyps pool aggregates multiple datasets, but explicit cross-dataset calibration/testing would be informative.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesTheorem/proof snippets contain typographical artifacts from PDF extraction (e.g., corrupted Greek letters and symbols in Theorems 2.1/2.2 proofs); while not fatal, they impede readability and should be corrected.Several implementation details are deferred or implicit (e.g., precise definition of E(A) and distance transforms in 3D, handling of anisotropic spacing), which matter for biomedical imaging.Some figures/tables show placeholder text or artifacts (“TABLE AREA”, blurred numbers); the camera-ready should replace these with finalized figures and numerical tables.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsMinimal discussion and no empirical comparison with: (i) morphological conformal approaches for segmentation that calibrate dilation/erosion radii to guarantee coverage of a fraction of the ground truth (e.g., nested-set CP with morphological operators), (ii) methods controlling inner false positive proportions via conformal calibration of score thresholds/erosions, and (iii) spatially structured or representation-space conformal methods that tighten sets by leveraging correlated uncertainty.

Please detail assumptions on grid spacing, isotropy, and how boundary discretization affects the bound in practice.Joint coverage via max(τ,γ) is valid; however, “pivotality” concerns raised in Remark 2.7 deserve a quantified treatment (e.g., simple simulation showing when joint-max calibration is inferior to Bonferroni splits and how transformation scaling mitigates imbalance).\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentPolyps: The repeated-split coverage curves and efficiency plots are strong and convincing; thank you for reporting uncertainty bands. Please add numerical summaries (mean coverage ± CI at canonical levels 0.8/0.9/0.95) and mean set sizes (inner/outer) to complement the plots.Brain and teeth: Include the same systematic coverage/effectiveness plots as for polyps; add standard segmentation metrics for the base models and correlate them with band tightness (beyond the brief discussion in the appendix).Edge-case analysis: Report behavior on images with empty ground-truth masks or tiny structures (where maxima/quantiles can be unstable). Also show the impact of different metrics ρ (Euclidean vs chessboard vs physical spacing-aware metrics) on outer-set size.Computational considerations: The stated runtimes are promising; add runtime break-down for distance transform computations and 3D cases, and memory considerations for large volumes.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Conformal risk control (Bates 2021; Angelopoulos et al. 2024): The paper correctly notes that risk-control methods target expected loss (e.g., FN rate) rather than full-set coverage. It would help to include a direct empirical comparison on polyps using a representative risk function (as in the cited works) to quantify the trade-off between tighter outer sets vs stricter guarantees.Morphology-based conformal segmentation (e.g., nested dilation CP; inner-mask FP control via erosion/thresholding): These methods offer black-box applicability (no logits) and sometimes more coherent margins; please discuss and, if possible, include a baseline that calibrates morphological dilation/erosion for outer/inner sets, respectively, on the same datasets. This would help position the proposed distance-transform method relative to black-box CP alternatives.Spatially structured CP (e.g., CONSIGN) and representation-space CP for downstream metrics (e.g., COMPASS): While these target different uncertainty objects (set-valued masks via low-dim subspaces or metric intervals), they address the same broad need—spatially coherent, efficient uncertainty. A short discussion clarifying scope (full mask coverage vs expected-risk vs metric coverage), assumptions (need for multiple stochastic samples vs single deterministic map), and potential hybridization opportunities would strengthen the context.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe image-wise guarantee is clinically meaningful (FWER-like protection), especially for critical applications where even one missed or spurious region matters. The distance-transform trick makes this practically viable in settings where score maps are unreliable near boundaries.Practical deployment will hinge on calibration under shift; the current approach assumes exchangeability. Consider adding a brief outline for detecting calibration drift and re-calibrating under shift (e.g., covariate-shift CP, importance-weighted calibration, or lightweight adaptive recalibration strategies).The framework is model-agnostic and adds minimal overhead, making it a good candidate for integration into clinical pipelines.

What are the exact conventions for maxima over empty index sets, and how do they affect coverage validity?\n- Can you provide a precise, reproducible definition of the boundary operator E(A) for 2D and 3D (marching squares vs marching cubes), and discuss the effect of anisotropic pixel/voxel spacing on the distance transform and Theorem 2.8?\n- How sensitive are the results to the choice of distance metric ρ and to discretization? Have you tried spacing-aware Euclidean distances in 3D brain datasets, and how do they change outer-set sizes and empirical coverage?\n- Could you include baseline comparisons with morphological CP approaches (calibrated dilation for outer sets, erosion/score-thresholding for inner sets) and with a risk-control outer-set baseline, on the polyps dataset?\n- When learning fI and fO, what is the exact data partitioning strategy to ensure independence from calibration/test? If training and learning sets overlap in images, how do you guard against leakage into calibration/test via fine-tuned transformations?\n- For joint coverage, did you measure empirical joint coverage under the α1 + α2 split versus the joint-max approach, and how did the two compare across datasets?\n- Could you report ablations for alternative combination functions (e.g., top-k maxima or spatial quantiles) to mitigate the conservativeness of the plain max, and comment on any changes to validity/efficiency?\n- In the teeth and brain studies, can you add the same repeated-split coverage curves and efficiency metrics as for polyps to substantiate generality?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper addresses an important need in medical image segmentation: simple, valid, and interpretable uncertainty quantification at the image level. The proposed inner/outer conformal confidence sets are technically sound, easy to implement, and supported by a pragmatic insight—distance transforms—that materially tightens outer sets, with a supporting Hausdorff distance result. The polyps study is thorough and convincingly demonstrates nominal coverage and efficiency gains from appropriate score transformations. However, for a top-tier venue, the experimental scope and positioning relative to closely related conformal segmentation baselines (morphological CP, conformal risk control, spatially structured CP) should be strengthened with direct comparisons and broader quantification (especially for brain and teeth). Clarifying edge cases, 3D/spacing details, and formalizing the data-splitting protocol will improve reproducibility and perceived rigor. Overall, the work is promising and impactful; with the suggested additions and cleanup, it would be a strong candidate for publication.",

        "text": "# IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging Review Report\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of providing formal uncertainty quantification for biomedical image segmentation models, which is essential for safe clinical deployment of AI systems in medical imaging. The authors develop a novel approach using conformal inference to generate spatial confidence sets with probabilistic guarantees for segmentation outputs. Their key innovation lies in adapting conformal methods to handle the spatial dependencies in images by using score transformations (particularly distance transformations) of neural network outputs to create tight inner and outer confidence sets. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive empirical validation across three diverse medical imaging domains (polyps colonoscopy, brain MRI, and dental X-ray segmentation), the authors demonstrate that their approach provides meaningful spatial uncertainty bounds while strictly controlling false coverage rates. The results show that distance-transformed scores significantly outperform raw logit scores, yielding confidence sets that are both theoretically valid and practically useful for identifying regions where segmentation predictions are reliable.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n1. **Limited comparison to alternative uncertainty quantification methods**: While the paper effectively compares to bounding box approaches (e.g., Andéol et al., 2023), it lacks direct comparison to other state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods for medical segmentation such as Monte Carlo dropout, deep ensembles, or Bayesian approaches. Including such comparisons would better position the method within the broader uncertainty quantification landscape and demonstrate its relative advantages.\n\n2. **Practical clinical implications could be strengthened**: The paper would benefit from more concrete examples of how these confidence sets would inform clinical decision-making. Specifically, how would practitioners interpret and act upon the inner/outer confidence sets in real clinical workflows? What is the added value compared to standard segmentation outputs with simple confidence thresholds?\n\n3. **Computational considerations for 3D volumes**: The distance transformation step, while effective, may present computational challenges for large 3D medical volumes. The paper should discuss the computational complexity of the approach, especially for 3D segmentation tasks, and potentially suggest optimizations for clinical deployment.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n1. **Clarification of learning dataset requirements**: The paper mentions setting aside a learning dataset for score transformation optimization but doesn't clearly specify the minimum size requirements or how performance varies with learning dataset size. Adding this information would help practitioners implement the method in resource-constrained settings.\n\n2. **Visualization consistency**: Some figures (e.g., Figure A16) could benefit from more consistent labeling and clearer distinction between different score transformation methods to facilitate direct comparison.\n\n3. **Algorithm implementation details**: While Algorithm 1 provides a good overview, more specific implementation details (e.g., exact parameter choices for the distance transformation, computational time for different image sizes) would enhance reproducibility.\n\n4. **Discussion of model performance dependency**: The paper notes that confidence set precision correlates with segmentation model quality (Section 6), but could elaborate more on how the approach performs when segmentation quality is poor, which is common in challenging clinical cases.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance**: This work addresses a critical gap in medical AI - the lack of formal uncertainty guarantees for segmentation outputs. Providing spatial confidence sets with probabilistic coverage is highly significant for clinical applications where segmentation errors can have serious consequences. The approach is applicable across multiple medical imaging domains, enhancing its potential impact on clinical practice.\n\n**Innovation**: The paper makes a substantial theoretical contribution by adapting conformal inference to provide spatial confidence sets for image segmentation, moving beyond pixel-wise confidence measures. The use of distance transformations to optimize confidence set tightness is particularly innovative, and the formal connection between spatial confidence sets and multiple testing error rates provides valuable conceptual framing.\n\n**Evaluation**: The authors provide thorough empirical validation across three diverse medical imaging datasets, with extensive visualizations and quantitative metrics. The coverage rate validation with 1000 resamples is particularly strong. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by direct comparisons to alternative uncertainty quantification methods beyond bounding box approaches.\n\n**Reproducibility**: The paper provides clear theoretical foundations and algorithmic descriptions, with supplementary code available for implementation. The detailed appendices and comprehensive visualization of results significantly enhance reproducibility. Including more specific implementation parameters and computational requirements would further strengthen this aspect.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nMinor Revision\n\nThe paper presents a significant and well-executed contribution to uncertainty quantification in medical image segmentation with strong theoretical foundations and thorough empirical validation. The approach addresses a critical need in clinical AI deployment by providing spatial confidence sets with formal guarantees. While the paper is fundamentally sound and makes a valuable contribution to the field, the major comments regarding comparison to alternative uncertainty quantification methods and clarification of practical clinical implications should be addressed to strengthen its impact and utility for the medical imaging community. The minor comments are relatively straightforward to address and would further improve the paper's clarity and reproducibility. Overall, this work has high potential to influence both research and clinical practice in medical AI if these revisions are incorporated.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles an important gap in biomedical image segmentation: the absence of formal uncertainty quantification for deep‑learning models, which can produce overconfident predictions that jeopardize clinical decisions. The authors assess their approach on three distinct domains—colonoscopy polyp images, brain‑MRI skull‑stripping, and dental radiographs—using pretrained segmentation networks that output per‑pixel logits. Their method relies on split‑conformal inference to generate inner and outer confidence sets. Thresholds are obtained from the distribution of the maximum transformed scores inside and outside the ground‑truth masks on a calibration set. Score transformations are learned on a separate dataset; the identity transformation is used for the inner set, while a distance‑transform is applied to the outer set to improve tightness. Experiments show that the constructed confidence sets achieve the nominal coverage probabilities on held‑out test data, demonstrating that the technique can provide probabilistic spatial guarantees for segmentation outputs.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:**  Offering distribution‑free, spatially resolved uncertainty guarantees for black‑box segmenters addresses a pressing need in medical imaging, where unchecked confidence can lead to harmful clinical outcomes.  \n- **Innovation:**  The use of the **maximum of transformed logits** for split‑conformal calibration, together with an explicit **distance‑transform score** for tighter outer sets, represents a novel departure from earlier pixel‑wise p‑value or FDR‑based methods.  \n- **Evaluation:**  The authors present experiments on three datasets and show that the nominal coverage levels are met (see Figures 4 and A16).  Nevertheless, the paper does not include quantitative comparisons with existing conformal segmentation baselines or other uncertainty‑estimation techniques, and there is no statistical testing of the reported improvements.  \n- **Reproducibility:**  While MATLAB code and a demonstration are mentioned in the supplement, crucial details—such as precise dataset versions, random‑seed handling, hyper‑parameters for the distance transform, and the exact protocol for constructing the learning set—are missing, making it difficult for others to replicate the work.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n- **Assumption 1 (exchangeability) not justified:**  The coverage guarantee hinges on exchangeability of the image‑pair sequence, yet the manuscript does not discuss possible violations (e.g., subject‑level correlation, scanner heterogeneity) or their effect on the theoretical guarantees (Section 2.1).  \n- **Baseline comparisons absent:**  No results are shown against state‑of‑the‑art conformal segmentation approaches (e.g., Angelopoulos et al., 2021; Mossina et al., 2024) or more conventional uncertainty methods (Monte‑Carlo dropout, deep ensembles).  Consequently, the relative advantage of the proposed confidence sets remains unclear.  \n- **Coverage evaluation lacks statistical rigor:**  Figures 4 and A16 report mean coverage over 1 000 resamples but omit confidence intervals or hypothesis tests, so the variability and significance of differences between score transformations cannot be assessed.  \n- **Efficiency metrics are under‑reported:**  Tightness is illustrated through diameter ratios (Figure 5) without accompanying statistical summaries (e.g., mean ± standard deviation) or clinically meaningful measures such as Hausdorff distance or Intersection‑over‑Union between the confidence sets and the ground truth.  \n- **Score‑transformation learning procedure undefined:**  Section 3.1 references a “learning dataset” used to select the best transformation, yet provides no algorithmic description (cross‑validation scheme, loss function, optimization details), hindering reproducibility of the transformation selection step.  \n- **Reproducibility gaps:**  Exact split proportions (e.g., “1798 polyp images → 298 learning, 1000 calibration, 500 test”), random‑seed strategy, hardware specifications, and software versions are omitted; the supplemental code lacks documentation of these essential details.  \n- **Computational cost claim unsupported:**  The statement that calibrating thresholds takes 0.03 s on a downscaled polyp set (Section 6) does not specify the hardware used, the data dimensionality, or how the method scales to full‑resolution 3D volumes.  \n- **Typographical and notation issues:**  The manuscript contains numerous formatting glitches (e.g., “_il‑_ _lustrate_”, “_c on‑ sequences”) and inconsistent symbols (τᵢ, γᵢ, f_I, f_O, λ_I) that impede readability and suggest insufficient proofreading.  \n- **No analysis of failure cases or clinical integration:**  The paper does not present examples where the confidence sets miss the ground‑truth mask or become excessively large, nor does it discuss concrete clinical workflows or user‑study evaluations that would substantiate the claimed practical impact.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\nThe manuscript makes an interesting contribution, but the lack of baseline comparisons, absence of statistical analysis, and several reproducibility shortcomings prevent the claims from being adequately supported.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript addresses an important need in biomedical image segmentation: the lack of formal uncertainty quantification for deep‑learning models, which can lead to overconfident and potentially unsafe clinical predictions. The authors propose a split‑conformal approach to generate inner and outer confidence sets around segmentation outputs, using transformed per‑pixel logits from pretrained networks. Experiments on three tasks—colonoscopy polyp segmentation, brain‑MRI skull‑stripping, and dental‑radiograph segmentation—demonstrate that the proposed method attains nominal coverage on held‑out data. Overall, the paper presents an appealing concept with promising results, but its empirical and methodological support remains incomplete.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and contribution** – The integration of split‑conformal calibration with distance‑transformed logits is conceptually innovative compared with pixel‑wise or FDR‑based calibration methods.  \n2. **Exchangeability assumption** – The theoretical guarantees depend on data exchangeability, but the manuscript does not discuss possible violations (e.g., inter‑subject correlation, scanner variability) or their implications (Section 2.1).  \n3. **Lack of baseline comparisons** – No quantitative results are provided against existing conformal segmentation methods (e.g., Angelopoulos et al., 2021; Mossina et al., 2024) or established uncertainty approaches such as Monte‑Carlo dropout or deep ensembles, leaving the relative advantage unclear.  \n4. **Statistical analysis of coverage** – Mean coverage values are shown without confidence intervals or tests of significance, limiting the rigor of claims about calibration quality.  \n5. **Evaluation metrics** – Tightness is illustrated only by diameter ratios; more complete measures such as mean ± standard deviation, Hausdorff distance, or Intersection‑over‑Union would better quantify efficiency and clinical relevance.  \n6. **Reproducibility issues** – Key implementation details are missing, including dataset splits, random‑seed policies, hyper‑parameters for distance transforms, and the algorithmic procedure for learning score transformations. The supplementary code lacks documentation of these aspects.  \n7. **Computational efficiency** – The reported 0.03 s calibration time lacks hardware context and scaling analysis for larger 3D data, making performance claims uncertain.  \n8. **Practical validation** – No failure‑case analysis or clinical‑workflow demonstration is provided to substantiate the real‑world applicability of the proposed confidence sets.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Numerous typographical and formatting inconsistencies occur (e.g., “_il‑_ _lustrate_”, “_c on‑sequences_”) and inconsistent notation (τᵢ, γᵢ, f_I, f_O, λ_I).

However, current generative methods exhibit a notable gap in clinical metrics when compared to medical image classification. Recently, leveraging diagnostic results to improve report quality has emerged as a promising approach. We are curious whether training a classifier that encompasses all possible long-tailed and rare diseases could enhance the robustness of reports. To investigate this question, this study designs an evaluation framework that integrates long-tail scenarios and summarizes potential combinations of LLM-based report generation models. We assess the impact of classification on report quality across four benchmarks. Initially, we introduce LLM-based language and clinical metrics and develop a pipeline to evaluate the model's performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution (OOD) long-tail scenarios. Subsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation of all potential model combinations. Our findings reveal that: 1) the impact of classification on report quality is positively correlated with the performance of classifiers, but the gap still exists, and 2) while classification can enhance report quality in in-domain long-tail scenarios, its benefits for OOD scenarios are limited.",

The authors investigate whether training a classifier that encompasses all possible long-tailed and rare diseases could enhance the robustness of reports. Key findings show that classification helps improve report quality in in-distribution settings but exhibits limited benefits in OOD scenarios.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper evaluates whether classification models can help improve the quality of radiology reports. This is a novel and interesting insight, with potential for aiding in real-world clinical workflows.\n2. The authors perform extensive evaluations across different strategies for incorporating classification information as well as in-domain vs. OOD settings. \n3. The authors also introduce novel LLM-based metrics for assessing the quality of radiology reports, which evaluate how well reports capture long-tail observations. This metric is an interesting contribution and has potential for aiding future works in the domain of radiology report generation.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe key weakness of this paper is inadequate evaluations, as discussed below.\n\n1. **Inadequate evaluations of classifier:** The incorporation of the classifier is inadequately evaluated, making it difficult to understand the settings in which incorporating a classifier is useful, as detailed below. The paper could have benefitted from more nuanced insights on when including the classifier helps vs. detracts from the quality of generated reports.\n\n    a. **Classifier Performance:** Although the incorporation of the classifier is the key contribution of this paper, the authors do not provide any evaluations on the quality of the actual classifier. What conditions does the classifier perform well on and which conditions does the classifier perform worse on? Does this correlate with report generation performance on the subset of images with particular conditions when the classifier is included? Does improving the performance of the classifier improve report generation quality? In OOD settings, the evaluated classifier displays poor performance  (12.0-14.0 F1 points), and as a result, it is not surprising that incorporating the classifier will not result in benefits to the RRG model in OOD settings; does this result change if the classifier is instead trained on the PadChest or IU X-ray datasets? All of these questions are critical for understanding when/how classification helps in RRG, but none of these are evaluated.\n\n    b. **Upper Bound:** It would be useful to establish an upper bound on performance of the report generation model by utilizing an “oracle” classifier (i.e. a hypothetical classifier that predicts every condition correctly). This would establish whether classification, in the optimal setting, makes useful contributions to the report generation task. As of now, the evaluations are limited by the poor performance of the evaluated classifier, and the key findings/takeaways from the paper are based on this specific classifier.\n\n2. **Inadequate evaluations of proposed metrics:** Although several new metrics are presented as key contributions of this paper, the quality of these metrics is not evaluated. How accurate is the OpenAI GPT-4o model at extracting disease categories? Did the authors check for false negatives / positives in this extraction procedure? Does this metric align with ground-truth labels for the conditions where labels are provided? Evaluating the quality of the metrics via a dataset like ReXVal would have been useful [1].\n\n[1] https://physionet.org/content/rexval-dataset/1.0.0/\n\n### Questions\n\nMy questions are detailed above in the weaknesses section.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript investigates whether integrating classification models—covering both common and rare diseases—can improve the robustness and quality of radiology report generation (RRG) systems. The study finds that while classification-based approaches enhance report quality for in-distribution data, they provide limited benefits in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The paper presents extensive evaluations across different classifier integration strategies and introduces novel large language model (LLM)-based metrics for assessing report quality, particularly in terms of capturing long-tail disease observations. Overall, the manuscript is clear and addresses an important question in clinical image analysis, though several aspects of the evaluation require strengthening.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Evaluation of Classifier Integration:** The investigation into classifier incorporation is insufficient. The paper does not explore under what conditions including a classifier improves or diminishes RRG performance. More granular analysis of when classification aids report quality would significantly improve interpretability.  \n2. **Classifier Performance Details:** Despite the classifier being central to the study’s contribution, there is no detailed assessment of its own performance. The results lack clarity regarding which conditions the classifier handles well or poorly and whether these trends correlate with report generation quality. The classifier performs poorly in OOD settings (12–14 F1 points), making it unsurprising that no gains are observed in those cases. The study would benefit from experiments using classifiers trained on alternative datasets (e.g., PadChest, IU X-ray) to assess generalizability and the relationship between classifier accuracy and report quality.  \n3. **Need for an Upper Bound:** Introducing an “oracle” classifier that predicts all conditions accurately could establish a meaningful upper bound for RRG performance, clarifying whether classification, in principle, can enhance generation quality beyond current limitations.  \n4. **Evaluation of Proposed Metrics:** The new LLM-derived metrics are proposed as key contributions but are not validated. The authors should assess how accurately GPT-4o extracts disease categories, check for false positives/negatives, and compare with ground truth where available—potentially using datasets such as ReXVal—to determine metric reliability.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify whether the LLM-based metrics correlate with human or clinical evaluations.  \n- Some references to datasets and model names could be more explicitly linked to experimental setups.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis work addresses an interesting and relevant question about leveraging classification for more robust radiology report generation. Its strengths include novelty, thoughtful motivation, and the introduction of innovative LLM-based evaluation metrics. However, the study’s impact is limited by insufficient validation of both the classifier and the proposed metrics. A more comprehensive evaluation—particularly analyzing classifier performance, exploring alternate datasets, and validating the new metrics—would substantially strengthen the conclusions.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The submission presents promising ideas but requires stronger empirical validation and methodological clarity before being suitable for acceptance.",

The study finds that while classification models improve report quality in in-domain scenarios, their impact is limited in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, especially for long-tail disease categories. The authors propose a comprehensive evaluation framework with novel LLM-based metrics and conduct experiments across multiple benchmarks, concluding that classification aids in in-domain accuracy but may introduce errors in OOD cases due to model biases.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe study tackles a critical challenge in medical AI—how to generate reliable and clinically relevant radiology reports that generalize well across diverse clinical scenarios. By showing that classification models can enhance in-domain performance while introducing potential errors in OOD settings, this paper offers valuable insights into the limitations and trade-offs of using classification-aided generation models. The paper is well-structured, with each section building logically upon the previous one. The problem formulation, methodology, and experimental setup are clearly articulated, enhancing accessibility for readers. The experimental design is thorough, incorporating multiple benchmarks and a diverse set of evaluation metrics, including novel LLM-based metrics, to assess model performance across both in-domain and OOD settings. The rigorous use of benchmarks and detailed comparisons with existing methods underscore the study's robustness and the reliability of its findings.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe primary weakness of this work lies in its motivation, or key argument, which has already been discussed in a prior publication that is not referenced in this submission. The previous study, Medical Report Generation Is A Multi-label Classification Problem (Fan et al., IEEE MedAI 2024), introduces a similar concept: that classification accuracy significantly impacts the quality of medical report generation. Both works share the same foundational idea, though they differ in specific model designs and classification categories. From a performance perspective, the previous work, which uses a cross-attention approach, demonstrates better outcomes and introduces the concept of ceiling performance. This concept suggests that the theoretical upper bound for this approach would be achieved if all ground-truth labels were provided to the model, given that real-world classifiers cannot reach 100% accuracy. \n\nWhile this submission’s strength lies in its extensive experiments, broader metrics, and a variety of models, its core insights are similar to the prior work, without addressing ceiling performance or providing a comparison to it. Additionally, the reason why the 28 classification categories used in the previous study outperform disease-based categories is not examined here. These points, along with further experimental and discussion-based additions, would significantly enhance the paper.\n\n### Questions\n\nplease read the weakness part.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

Overall, the paper is clearly written, methodologically sound, and well organized, presenting its rationale, experimental design, and results in a coherent manner.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and Relation to Prior Work**: The central motivation and conceptual contribution are closely aligned with an existing study, *Medical Report Generation Is a Multi-label Classification Problem* (Fan et al., IEEE MedAI 2024). That prior work already articulated the key idea that classification accuracy influences the quality of generated medical reports. Although the current paper differs in its choice of model architectures and classification taxonomies, its fundamental premise is not sufficiently distinct. The absence of explicit discussion or citation of the earlier study weakens the claim of novelty.  \n2. **Evaluation Scope**: The previous work introduced the concept of ceiling performance, representing an upper bound achievable if ground truth labels were perfectly known. This important consideration is not addressed here, leaving unclear how far current results are from this theoretical upper limit.  \n3. **Category Design**: The reason for differing outcomes between disease-based classification categories (used here) and the 28-class label scheme (used in the prior study) is not investigated. A comparative or analytical discussion of this difference would clarify design trade-offs and contribute to a more robust understanding of classification effects.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Overall presentation and logical flow are strong.  \n- Experimental coverage is comprehensive, with clear methodological descriptions and diverse evaluation metrics.  \n- No ethical concerns are noted.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis is a technically competent and clearly presented study addressing an important problem in medical AI.

The authors explore different architectures on the combination of vision encoders, classifiers, and LLM, and perform lots of experiments. They get the findings that classification can enhance report quality in in-domain long-tail scenarios but is bounded by the performance of the classifier.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. Many research focuses on  LLM-based report generation models, which is an important task for the medical AI domain, the question this paper investigated may provide some useful information for future research.  \n2. The research comprehensively evaluates different architectural combinations (vision encoders, classifiers, and LLMs) across multiple diverse datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT, PadChest, and IU X-Ray).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The comparison between the four baseline models lacks analysis. The metrics give inconsistent results, how could the author get the results that C+V+LLM is better than V+LLM, and the comparison between Refining and C+V+LLM, giving statistical significance analysis of the results would be helpful.\n\n2. The poor performance of the 'Expanding' approach may be due to the prompt rather than inherent limitations.  I do not find details about the prompts used (apologize if I overlooked them). The 'Expanding' prompt should include standard medical report templates to prove a fair comparison.\n\n3. The classifier only provides binary disease presence information without crucial details like location and severity. This limitation makes hallucinations in LLM-generated reports inevitable when using classification-only inputs. Instead of comparing with these inherently limited training-free approaches, the paper would be more valuable if it explored different variants of end-to-end Vision + LLM full training. \n\n4. The paper's title 'Is classification all you need for radiology report generation?' raises a clear question, but fails to provide the answer. While the findings show that classification helps with in-domain cases but struggles with OOD scenarios, the paper leaves crucial questions unanswered: Is better classification the solution? Or should we focus on pursuing end-to-end training approaches? If the answer is ' we need better classification models', then everyone knows it.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

A statistical significance analysis of the results would strengthen the claims, particularly in comparing the Refining and C+V+LLM settings.  \n2. **Prompt Design and Fairness** – The poor performance of the “Expanding” approach may stem from suboptimal prompt design rather than inherent model limitations. The paper lacks details about the prompts used. Including standardized medical report templates within the prompts could create a fairer comparison.  \n3. **Classifier Limitations and Model Design** – The classifier provides only binary disease presence information, omitting critical localization and severity cues.

Hence, the innovation is more **empirical and benchmarking-oriented** than algorithmic.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor** –  \n   - The experiments are thorough: multiple datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT, PadChest, IU X-Ray), carefully separated in-domain vs. OOD testing, and use of robust baselines.  \n   - Metrics and ablation studies are exhaustively detailed, with appropriate reporting of macro/micro F1, BLEU/ROUGE, and LLM-based metrics.  \n   - However, **quantitative uncertainty or statistical significance** testing is not reported, and many analyses rely on heuristic interpretation of observed trends.  \n   - Some aspects (e.g., use of GPT-4-based evaluation) introduce subjectivity and reproducibility concerns, since API-based results can vary.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation** –  \n   - The manuscript is generally clear and well-structured, though lengthy with some redundancy across sections.  \n   - Figures and tables are informative but dense; Figure 1 and the multi-page tables may require reformatting for journal readability.  \n   - Minor grammar and phrasing issues appear but do not hinder comprehension.  \n   - Equation-level or theoretical formulations are minimal; the work is largely experimental.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance** –  \n   - The authors explicitly use **public datasets** (MIMIC-CXR, PadChest, IU X-Ray) with proper citations.  \n   - All datasets are de-identified; ethical compliance appears adequate.  \n   - Code availability is not explicitly stated—reproducibility could be strengthened by releasing model code, prompt templates, and evaluation scripts, especially for LLM-based scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \n   The manuscript investigates whether improved image classification performance translates into higher-quality radiology report generation. The authors propose a comprehensive **benchmark and evaluation framework** that tests multiple combinations of vision encoders, classifiers, and large language models (LLMs). They introduce **two LLM-based evaluation metrics** addressing the shortcomings of traditional language and clinical metrics. Through experiments on four datasets (in-domain and OOD, long-tail distributions), the study concludes that while classification outputs can improve report quality for common in-domain cases, their benefits do not generalize to out-of-distribution long-tail pathologies, sometimes even degrading performance.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n   - Timely topic addressing the **integration of large language models in medical imaging**.  \n   - Systematic exploration and well-structured benchmark that could serve the community.  \n   - Insightful empirical observation clarifying the limited utility of diagnostic classifiers for OOD generation.  \n   - Introduction of LLM-based metrics that qualitatively enhance the evaluation of generated clinical text.  \n   - Extensive ablation and dataset diversity improve credibility of trends.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n   - Limited *methodological novelty*: the framework largely reuses established architectures and metrics, with limited theoretical advancement.  \n   - Reproducibility depends heavily on proprietary LLM APIs (GPT‑4), reducing accessibility.  \n   - Lacks formal statistical analysis or uncertainty quantification for comparative results.  \n   - Discussion of the *mechanistic reasons* for classification–generation gaps remains descriptive; no modeling insight or mathematical analysis is provided.  \n   - Some contextual framing (e.g., clinical interpretability, alignment with diagnostic reasoning) could be expanded to emphasize imaging science impact.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n   1. Clarify the **novelty boundary**: is this primarily an evaluation paper or a modeling contribution? The abstract and title may overstate methodological innovation relative to the actual scope.  \n   2. Strengthen **methodological rationale** for new LLM-based metrics—describe how they are validated against expert judgment or inter-rater consistency.  \n   3. Discuss **statistical significance and variability** in reported results; include confidence intervals or standard deviations where possible.  \n   4. Provide **code and pipeline availability** for LLM-based evaluation; otherwise, the benchmark cannot be adopted or verified.  \n   5. Improve **discussion of clinical relevance**: how might these findings inform the next generation of clinically trustworthy ARRG systems?  \n   6. Consider reducing redundancy in Results/Appendix and enhancing visual clarity (condensed tables, key examples).  \n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n   - Carefully proofread for minor grammatical inconsistencies (“aim to,” “would improve”) and typographical errors.  \n   - In Figure 1, ensure architectural variants are legible in grayscale print.  \n   - Explicitly define all abbreviations at first use (e.g., ICL, RJ-n).  \n   - Move dataset preprocessing details to supplementary material for length reduction.  \n   - Update the references to the latest *TMI* or *MedIA* works on multimodal LLM evaluation if available.\n\n6. **Overall Recommendation** – **Major Revision**  \n   The work is thorough, relevant, and potentially impactful as a community benchmark, but it falls short of TMI’s threshold for publication-ready novelty and methodological generality in its present form. Clarify conceptual contributions, enhance reproducibility, and solidify empirical rigor to justify acceptance.\n\n7. **Confidence Level** – **4 / 5**  \n   Confident in the assessment; findings and claims are well-supported but rely on external LLM-based evaluation that may evolve.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Decision:** *Major Revision — potentially valuable benchmark contribution; requires stronger articulation of novelty, reproducible methodology, and quantitative rigor to meet IEEE TMI standards.*",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper investigates whether incorporating classification information can improve the robustness of automatic radiology report generation (ARRG), particularly for long-tail and out-of-distribution scenarios. The authors design an evaluation framework that combines LLM-based report generation models with diagnostic classifiers, proposing four baseline architectures: vision+LLM, classifier+vision+LLM, expanding, and refining approaches (Figure 1). They introduce LLM-based evaluation metrics including LLM-RadJudge and Long-tailed & OOD F1 scores to assess performance beyond conventional language and clinical metrics (Section 2.3.2). Experiments across four datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT, PadChest, IU X-Ray) reveal that while classification information improves report quality in in-domain scenarios, it provides limited benefits for out-of-distribution long-tail cases when using powerful foundation models like Llama 3.1 70B and GPT-4 (Tables 2, 4, 5).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Insufficient Mathematical Rigor in Model Formulation**\n  - The paper lacks formal mathematical definitions for the core components (vision encoder, classifier, LLM integration) described in Section 2.2, making it difficult to assess technical soundness\n  - No explicit loss functions or optimization objectives are provided for the different training paradigms (end-to-end vs. training-free), which is critical for reproducibility\n  - The connector architecture is only briefly mentioned as \"multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with GELU activations\" (Section 2.1) without mathematical specifications\n\n• **Limited Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis**\n  - Tables 1-2 show results without confidence intervals, standard deviations, or significance tests, undermining the reliability of claimed improvements\n  - The choice of 100 and 200 long-tail categories for classifier training (Table 2) appears arbitrary with no justification or ablation study\n  - Case studies are limited to individual examples (Figure 3, Figure 5) without systematic analysis across the test sets\n\n• **Questionable Evaluation Framework Validity**\n  - The LLM-based metrics (LLM-RadJudge, Long-tailed & OOD F1) rely on GPT-4o for ground truth extraction (Section 2.3.2), introducing potential bias and circularity in evaluation\n  - The paper acknowledges that \"varying granularity in observation names across datasets requires semantic transformation\" but doesn't address how this affects metric reliability\n  - No validation of the proposed metrics against radiologist assessments or existing clinical standards\n\n• **Unclear Methodology and Reproducibility Issues**\n  - The data preprocessing pipeline lacks detail, particularly for the OOD datasets where Spanish reports are translated to English using GPT-4 (Section 2.3.1)\n  - Implementation details are relegated to the appendix with insufficient description of hyperparameter selection and model training procedures\n  - The \"refining\" approach methodology is not clearly explained in the main text, making it difficult to understand how classification information is integrated\n\n• **Weak Analysis of Core Research Question**\n  - The title question \"Is classification all you need?\" is not systematically addressed through controlled experiments isolating classification effects\n  - The paper conflates multiple variables (model architecture, training paradigm, dataset domain) making it difficult to attribute performance differences to classification integration\n  - Finding 2 states limitations for OOD scenarios but doesn't provide sufficient analysis of why this occurs or potential solutions\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance Mathematical Formulation and Technical Clarity**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definitions for each model component including input/output dimensions and transformation functions\n  - Specify explicit loss functions and optimization objectives for each training paradigm with proper mathematical notation\n  - Include detailed architectural specifications for the connector and classification integration mechanisms\n\n• **Strengthen Experimental Rigor and Statistical Validation**\n  - Report confidence intervals and conduct statistical significance tests for all performance comparisons across tables\n  - Provide systematic ablation studies justifying the choice of long-tail category numbers and other key hyperparameters\n  - Expand case studies to include quantitative analysis across larger sample sets rather than cherry-picked examples\n\n• **Validate and Improve Evaluation Framework**\n  - Validate LLM-based metrics against expert radiologist evaluations to establish reliability and remove potential circular reasoning\n  - Address the acknowledged issues with cross-dataset observation granularity through systematic semantic alignment studies\n  - Include traditional clinical validation metrics alongside the proposed LLM-based approaches\n\n• **Clarify Methodology and Ensure Reproducibility**\n  - Move essential implementation details from appendix to main text and provide comprehensive hyperparameter justification\n  - Describe the data preprocessing pipeline in detail, particularly for cross-lingual translation and its potential impact on results\n  - Provide clear algorithmic descriptions of the \"refining\" approach and other training-free methods\n\n• **Systematically Address the Core Research Question**\n  - Design controlled experiments that isolate the effect of classification information while holding other variables constant\n  - Provide deeper analysis of why classification helps in-domain but fails for OOD scenarios, potentially through attention visualization or ablation studies\n  - Restructure the paper to more directly answer the title question with clear experimental evidence and theoretical justification",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript investigates the impact of incorporating classification information into large language model (LLM)-based radiology report generation systems. The authors hypothesize that integrating a classifier trained on long-tailed and rare diseases can enhance the robustness of generated reports. They evaluate this hypothesis using four benchmarks and a comprehensive set of metrics, including traditional language and clinical metrics, as well as novel LLM-based metrics. The results reveal that while classification information improves report quality in in-domain scenarios, it has limited benefits in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. The study highlights the potential of classification in improving report generation but also underscores the challenges faced by LLMs in handling long-tail and OOD data.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The manuscript contributes to the ongoing discussion on the role of classification in report generation, but it could benefit from a clearer distinction from related works. The authors should more explicitly compare their approach with recent studies that have explored the integration of classification and LLMs in medical imaging tasks. Additionally, the manuscript should provide a more detailed analysis of how the proposed method differs from existing techniques in terms of both conceptual design and empirical performance.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experiments are conducted on a diverse set of datasets, including in-domain and OOD scenarios. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including more detailed case studies and analyses of the generated reports. Specifically, qualitative evaluations of the generated reports in OOD scenarios could provide deeper insights into the limitations and potential biases of the models. Moreover, the inclusion of additional clinical metrics, such as those that assess the impact of the generated reports on clinical decision-making, would further bolster the manuscript's contributions.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares the proposed approach against several state-of-the-art baselines, but it lacks comparisons with recent diffusion-based and transformer-based methods that have shown promising results in medical image synthesis and report generation. Including these comparisons would provide a more comprehensive view of the proposed method's performance relative to the latest advancements in the field.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript states that code will be released, but the description of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters is insufficient for full reproducibility. Providing a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including the exact configurations and data preprocessing pipelines, would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the work.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity of Figures: Figures 3 and 5 are somewhat cluttered. Simplifying the presentation by showing fewer representative examples with zoomed-in regions would improve readability.\n   \n2. Notation Consistency: The notation for the vision encoder and classification tokens is inconsistent. Clarifying these notations and ensuring consistency throughout the manuscript would aid in understanding the model architecture.\n   \n3. Acronym Definitions: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition. Providing definitions for all acronyms would improve clarity.\n   \n4. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical issues such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7) should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in the field of automatic radiology report generation by investigating the impact of classification information on report quality. The proposed adaptation of LLMs to incorporate diagnostic results from classifiers is technically sound and offers valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of current approaches. The evaluation framework is comprehensive and includes both traditional and novel metrics, providing a thorough assessment of the proposed method. However, the evaluation could be strengthened with additional qualitative analyses and comparisons to recent diffusion-based and transformer-based methods. The reproducibility of the approach is currently limited due to incomplete methodological details, which needs to be addressed. Overall, while the manuscript makes a meaningful contribution to the field, there is room for improvement in terms of comprehensive evaluation and reproducibility.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand their comparative analysis to include recent diffusion-based and transformer-based methods, conduct more detailed qualitative evaluations, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "## Is CLASSIFICATION ALL YOU NEED FOR RADIOLOGY REPORT GENERATION?\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper investigates whether improving multi-label classifiers is sufficient to close the gap between medical image classification and radiology report generation, particularly under long-tailed and out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. The authors propose a design space for LLM-based report generation (vision encoder, classifier, LLM) and a robustness-oriented evaluation framework that augments standard language/clinical metrics with LLM-based metrics, including an LLM judge and an LLM-extracted long-tail/OOD F1.

this undercuts the conclusion that classification “helps in-domain but not OOD” without testing guardrails.The switch from DICOM to JPG inputs (for compatibility) is acknowledged but not quantified; this could degrade subtle findings and confound conclusions about gaps between generation and classification.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesLimited comparison to several strong contemporary methods focused on clinical fidelity and long-tail robustness, such as LM-RRG (clinical RL), RA-RRG (retrieval-augmented generation), and concept-alignment pipelines like RadAlign; results would be more compelling with these baselines.No statistical significance analysis, error bars, or calibration metrics; correlation claims between classifier quality and report outcomes would benefit from controlled sweeps with quantified variance.The PadChest OOD evaluation is based on a small random sample (n=500) and English translation via GPT-4, which may shift label distributions and semantics relative to the original; the impact of translation is not analyzed.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesSeveral tables have missing values, formatting artifacts, and unexplained metric names (e.g., RGER vs RadGraph F1), reducing interpretability and reproducibility.Definitions of LT-100/LT-200 label sets, their coverage, and mapping across datasets are under-specified, making it hard to assess OOD label-space mismatch.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited discussion and empirical comparison with recent pipelines that (a) align visual concepts to diagnostic criteria (RadAlign), (b) use RL with clinical rewards (LM-RRG), or (c) employ retrieval/quality-control auditing (RA-RRG; auditing frameworks) to mitigate hallucinations and noisy classifier propagation.The CXR-LT 2024 challenge highlights stronger long-tail practices (reweighting, ensembles, synthetic augmentation, calibration); these strategies are not tested here to see if they change the central finding.\n\nTechnical limitations or concerns\n\n- The LLM-based long-tail/OOD F1 relies on GPT-4o extraction and ad-hoc label mappings, which introduces uncertainty, potential subjectivity, and limited reproducibility without extensive details or calibration checks.\n- Lack of uncertainty-aware integration (e.g., calibration, abstention, confidence gating) despite the finding that misclassifications can mislead LLMs;

the impact of translation is not analyzed.\n\nClarity or presentation issues\n\n- Several tables have missing values, formatting artifacts, and unexplained metric names (e.g., RGER vs RadGraph F1), reducing interpretability and reproducibility.\n- Definitions of LT-100/LT-200 label sets, their coverage, and mapping across datasets are under-specified, making it hard to assess OOD label-space mismatch.\n\nMissing related work or comparisons\n\n- Limited discussion and empirical comparison with recent pipelines that (a) align visual concepts to diagnostic criteria (RadAlign), (b) use RL with clinical rewards (LM-RRG), or (c) employ retrieval/quality-control auditing (RA-RRG; auditing frameworks) to mitigate hallucinations and noisy classifier propagation.\n- The CXR-LT 2024 challenge highlights stronger long-tail practices (reweighting, ensembles, synthetic augmentation, calibration); these strategies are not tested here to see if they change the central finding.\n\n### Detailed Comments\n\n- Technical soundness evaluationThe central claim—that classification improves in-domain report quality but has limited OOD benefits and can amplify errors—is plausible and supported by aggregate metrics and cases. However, the current integration strategies are relatively naive (token injection, prompts, basic refining), and the study omits uncertainty-aware fusions (e.g., confidence gating, selective abstention, calibration, ensembling). Without these, the conclusion may overstate the limits of classification-informed generation.The proposed LLM-based metrics are directionally useful, but they demand rigorous controls: inter-rater reliability between LLM labelers and human experts, stability across prompts/temperature, ontology normalization across datasets, and handling of near-synonyms and hierarchies (e.g., lobe vs lung). Absent these, metric variance may be high.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentDataset coverage is appropriate, but the OOD samples for PadChest are small and potentially confounded by translation. Consider evaluating directly in Spanish with clinically tuned NER/labelers or validating that translation preserves mention-level labels.The ablation on [CLS] vs promptifying classification information is informative; however, the study would benefit from:A calibrated thresholding study (e.g., tune per-class thresholds using dev sets; ECE/Brier scores; temperature scaling/Dirichlet calibration) and analysis of how confidence gating affects generation outcomes and OOD robustness.Selective prediction experiments that trade coverage for accuracy (auditing frameworks), e.g., deferring to human when classifier vs text labels disagree, as in modular auditing approaches.Controlled sweeps of classifier strength (e.g., synthetic noise injection or different backbones and training regimes) to quantify the monotonic relationship between classifier F1 and generation quality more precisely (confidence intervals, regression analyses).The decision to use MIMIC-CXR-JPG rather than DICOM for vision inputs should be supported by quantitative comparisons; subtle pathologies can be degraded by lossy transformations.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Relative to MAIRA-1, this work focuses more on evaluation design and classifier integration than on pushing SOTA generation quality.

Can you share the ontology mappings and coverage statistics?\n- For the GPT-4o-based long-tail/OOD F1, what prompts, temperatures, and normalization rules did you use? How consistent are extractions across repeated runs, and how do they correlate with human annotations?\n- Did you evaluate classifier calibration (ECE, Brier, temperature scaling) and test confidence gating/abstention when injecting classifier outputs into the LLM? If so, how did coverage–quality trade-offs change?\n- What was the impact of translating PadChest reports into English on label distributions and metrics? Did you try native Spanish labelers or concept normalization (e.g., UMLS/RadGraph mapping) to avoid translation artifacts?\n- Why did you choose MIMIC-CXR-JPG rather than DICOM or the MAIRA-1 pipeline’s DICOM pathway? Do you have quantitative evidence that this choice does not adversely affect clinical findings?\n- Can you provide statistical significance and error bars for the main comparisons (especially the “classification helps in-domain” result) and per-class head/medium/tail analyses?\n- Did you experiment with retrieval augmentation (e.g., exemplar reports) or concept-alignment losses (as in RadAlign) to reduce classifier-error amplification? If not, what challenges prevented this?\n- How do your results change when using auditing pipelines that reconcile image-derived labels with text-derived labels and defer disagreements (e.g., Warr et al.)?\n- Are multi-view studies handled explicitly? If not, could multi-view fusion alter your conclusions about classifier vs LLM contributions?\n- Will you release code, prompts, and the LLM-judge evaluation scripts to facilitate replication and standardization?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis is a timely, thoughtful analysis paper that asks an important question for clinically reliable radiology report generation: does a stronger classifier suffice? The study’s main finding—that classification boosts in-domain metrics but offers limited or even negative OOD benefits without safeguards—is valuable and likely to influence practice. The work is strengthened by its design space framing, long-tail/OOD emphasis, and ablations on how to inject classifier information.\n\nHowever, the evaluation pipeline has methodological gaps that limit the conclusiveness of the claims. The LLM-based long-tail/OOD metric needs more rigorous standardization and validation; OOD evaluation is small and confounded by translation; key modern baselines (RL-aligned, retrieval-augmented, concept-aligned) are not included; and uncertainty-aware fusion and auditing, which are directly relevant to your conclusions, are not tested. Table/reporting artifacts also impede clarity and reproducibility.\n\nWith a more rigorous and transparent evaluation (calibration, abstention, larger OOD sets without translation, statistical tests), stronger baselines, and inclusion of safety mechanisms (gating/auditing), this paper could reach top-tier impact as a benchmark/analysis contribution. As it stands, it is a useful and thought-provoking step that surfaces critical pitfalls, but it needs additional experimental depth and cleaner reporting to meet the standards of a top-tier venue.",

It explores a systematic design space for LLM-based report generation, integrating visual encoders, classifiers, and large language models. A robustness-oriented evaluation framework is introduced, augmenting conventional clinical and language metrics with LLM-based assessments such as an “LLM judge” and LLM-extracted tail/OOD F1 scores. Experiments across multiple datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT, PadChest, IU X-Ray) show that classification improvements benefit in-domain performance but have limited or adverse OOD effects, as classifier errors may mislead the LLM.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Technical rigor and novelty:** The study’s systematic exploration of classifier–LLM integration is commendable, yet its evaluation metrics rely on GPT-4o label extraction and heuristic mappings that may reduce reproducibility. The absence of calibration checks or inter-rater validation weakens confidence in the proposed long-tail/OOD metric.  \n2. **Methodological gaps:** No uncertainty-aware mechanisms such as calibration, confidence gating, or abstention are tested, despite their direct relevance to the identified failure mode. The claim that classification helps only in-domain could be overstated without these controls.  \n3. **Experimental limitations:** OOD evaluation is based on a small, translated PadChest subset, potentially altering label semantics. The switch from DICOM to JPG is unquantified and could affect clinical fidelity.  \n4. **Missing baselines:** Key recent methods—LM-RRG (RL-aligned generation), RA-RRG (retrieval-augmented), and RadAlign (concept-based alignment)—are not compared, limiting the contextual depth of results.  \n5. **Statistical reporting:** The paper lacks significance tests, variance analyses, and calibration metrics. Controlled sweeps over classifier strength and confidence effects would reinforce the core claims.  \n6. **Clarity and reproducibility:** Incomplete tables, undefined acronyms (e.g., RGER), and missing definitions for LT-100/LT-200 sets reduce interpretability. Precise label mappings, prompts, and extraction details should be released for replication.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clean up table formatting and fill missing values.  \n- Include per-class head/mid/tail results and calibration metrics.  \n- Quantify the impact of JPG over DICOM inputs.  \n- Clarify prompt templates, temperatures, and extraction consistency for GPT-4o metrics.  \n- Discuss the translation artifacts from Spanish PadChest to English evaluation.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis is a timely, carefully framed study that raises an important question about the role of classification in report generation.

The paper would benefit from stronger statistical analysis, transparent protocols, and inclusion of confidence- or retrieval-based mechanisms to ensure robustness and clinical safety.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The work offers significant insights but requires improved methodological rigor, expanded baselines, validation of LLM-derived metrics, and clearer reporting before acceptance.",

        "text": "# Review Report for \"IS CLASSIFICATION ALL YOU NEED FOR RADIOLOGY REPORT GENERATION?\"\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper investigates the significant performance gap between medical image classification and radiology report generation, where current generative methods lag approximately 20% behind classification models in diagnostic accuracy. The authors explore whether incorporating classification information, particularly from models trained on long-tailed and rare disease distributions, can improve the quality and diagnostic accuracy of automatically generated radiology reports. They design a comprehensive evaluation framework that integrates long-tail scenarios and systematically evaluates different combinations of vision encoders, classifiers, and LLMs across both in-domain (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT) and out-of-distribution (PadChest, IU X-Ray) datasets. Their findings reveal that while classification information can enhance report quality in in-domain long-tail scenarios (with Macro F1 improvements of ~2-3%), its benefits for out-of-distribution scenarios are limited, and in some cases, incorporating classifier outputs can even degrade performance due to error propagation. The authors demonstrate that the \"Refining\" approach (using classification information to refine existing generated reports) outperforms direct expansion methods, but the persistent performance gap between classification and generation suggests that classification alone is not sufficient for high-quality report generation.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths:\n- The paper presents a well-designed evaluation framework that properly addresses the long-tail distribution challenges in medical imaging, which is a critical issue in clinical applications.\n- Introduction of LLM-based metrics (beyond traditional language and clinical metrics) provides more nuanced assessment of report quality, particularly for long-tail and rare conditions.\n- The systematic exploration of different model architectures (end-to-end vs. training-free approaches) offers valuable insights for future model development in the field.\n- Clear demonstration of the limitations of using classification information for OOD scenarios addresses an important gap in current understanding.\n- Comprehensive ablation studies examining the impact of different components (vision encoders, MLP layers, LLM scales) provide practical guidance for implementation.\n\n### Major Limitations:\n- The paper identifies the performance gap between classification and generation but offers limited exploration of why this gap persists beyond the hypothesis about missing descriptive details in classification information.\n- The evaluation is limited to chest X-rays; the generalizability of findings to other imaging modalities (CT, MRI) is unclear and should be addressed.\n- While the paper shows that classification information can introduce errors, it lacks a detailed analysis of specific error patterns and failure modes, which would strengthen the practical implications of the findings.\n- The paper could benefit from more concrete recommendations about when and how to optimally incorporate classification information for different clinical scenarios.\n\n### Minor Comments:\n- Figure 2 could be better labeled to clarify the distinction between \"w/ [IMG CLS] token\" and \"w/o [IMG CLS] token\" conditions, as the current presentation may be confusing to readers unfamiliar with vision transformer architectures.\n- Some sections, particularly the Related Work, could be more concise while maintaining necessary context.\n- The paper mentions the potential for LLMs to selectively use additional data during fine-tuning but doesn't explore this direction in depth, which would have strengthened the discussion.\n- More specific guidance on computational trade-offs between different approaches would be valuable for clinical implementation.\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance**: This work addresses a critical problem in medical AI - the substantial performance gap between image classification and report generation. Understanding the conditions under which classification information improves report quality has direct implications for developing more accurate clinical decision support systems. The findings help set realistic expectations about the benefits of classification-based approaches and have practical value for the medical imaging community.\n\n**Innovation**: The paper introduces a novel evaluation framework with LLM-based metrics specifically designed for assessing report generation in long-tail scenarios. The systematic exploration of the model design space and clear categorization of approaches (end-to-end vs. training-free) provide valuable new insights. The finding that classification information helps in-domain but not OOD scenarios is counterintuitive and represents an important contribution to the field.\n\n**Evaluation**: The evaluation is thorough across multiple dimensions - different model architectures, vision encoders, LLM scales, and datasets (including both in-domain and OOD long-tail scenarios). The use of both traditional and LLM-based metrics provides a comprehensive assessment of model performance. However, the paper would be strengthened by a more detailed analysis of specific error patterns when classification information is incorporated.\n\n**Reproducibility**: The paper provides sufficient implementation details, including training procedures, hyperparameters, and dataset descriptions. The ablation studies are well-documented, and the model variants are clearly defined. While the authors describe their experimental setup comprehensively, explicit mention of code and model checkpoint availability would further enhance reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nMinor Revision\n\nThe paper presents a well-conducted study with significant findings about the limitations of using classification information for radiology report generation. The evaluation is thorough, the methodology sound, and the findings have practical implications for the field. The authors have addressed an important clinical problem with a systematic approach that advances our understanding of when and how classification information can improve report generation. While there are areas for improvement (particularly in error analysis and generalizability), these can be addressed through minor revisions. The paper makes a valuable contribution to understanding the relationship between classification and report generation in medical imaging and merits publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging after addressing the specific concerns outlined in the major and minor comments.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe authors explore whether a comprehensive classification of radiological findings—including long‑tailed and rare diseases—can strengthen automatic radiology report generation (ARRG). They train their models on the MIMIC‑CXR dataset and evaluate them on four benchmarks (MIMIC‑CXR, CXR‑LT, PadChest, and IU X‑Ray), constructing an evaluation framework that captures both in‑domain and out‑of‑distribution (OOD) long‑tail scenarios. A design space for LLM‑based report generation is defined, consisting of a vision encoder, a classifier, and a large language model (LLM). The study compares several configurations—vision‑only, classifier‑augmented, and refined prompting—and reports results using conventional language and clinical metrics together with two LLM‑derived metrics. The findings indicate that classification can improve report quality for in‑domain long‑tail cases in proportion to classifier performance, but offers limited advantage for OOD cases and may even magnify classifier errors in long‑tail settings. The principal contribution is a systematic analysis of how classifiers influence LLM‑driven ARRG across a variety of evaluation conditions.\n\n---  \n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:** The investigation of how diagnostic classification might bolster ARRG addresses a clinically relevant challenge, particularly for rare pathologies where reliability is essential.  \n- **Innovation:** The paper presents three notable elements: (i) a clear taxonomy of LLM‑based report generators (see Figure 1), (ii) two novel LLM‑derived evaluation metrics, and (iii) an extensive empirical assessment of classifier‑report interactions. While the taxonomy is helpful, the underlying concept of feeding classifier outputs to an LLM has been explored in recent literature (e.g., Wang et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024), which narrows the novelty margin.  \n- **Evaluation:** The authors employ four datasets and a broad suite of language, clinical, and LLM‑based metrics (Tables 1‑5). However, the analysis would benefit from statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, and an independent radiologist assessment. Moreover, the OOD subsets are relatively small (e.g., 500 PadChest images and 756 IU‑X‑Ray images), limiting the robustness of the conclusions.  \n- **Reproducibility:** Training specifics such as optimizer, learning‑rate schedule, and number of epochs are documented (Appendix F), yet key details—random seeds, precise data splits for the long‑tail subsets, prompt templates, and the configuration of the LLM‑RadJudge metric—are missing. Additionally, the code and model checkpoints have not been released, which hampers reproducibility.\n\n---  \n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n- **Title and framing:** The current title, “IS CLASSIFICATION ALL YOU NEED FOR,” is incomplete and could mislead readers into believing the paper proves classification alone is sufficient. A clearer phrasing that reflects the paper’s evaluative focus would improve comprehension.  \n- **Typographical and formatting issues:** Throughout the manuscript there are stray numbers (e.g., “054‑077”), broken tables, and duplicated figure captions. These distractions detract from readability and suggest the need for careful editorial polishing.  \n- **Statistical analysis:** The manuscript does not present any significance testing (e.g., paired t‑tests, bootstrapping) to substantiate claims such as “the impact of classification on report quality is positively correlated with classifier performance.” Incorporating such analyses would strengthen the evidential basis of the results.  \n- **OOD experiment robustness:** The PadChest and IU‑X‑Ray evaluations each rely on a single random sample (500 and 756 images, respectively) without reporting variability. Consequently, reported macro‑F1 improvements (e.g., 7.5 % versus 12.8 %) may not be reliable. Providing multiple splits or confidence intervals would address this concern.  \n- **Human evaluation:** While the authors argue that traditional clinical metrics have limitations, they do not include a radiologist or expert study to validate the proposed LLM‑based metrics (LLM‑RadJudge, disease‑extraction). Adding such validation would greatly enhance the credibility of these new metrics.  \n- **Details of “expanding” and “refining” paradigms:** The description of how classification prompts are tokenized, how many tokens are added, and how the LLM processes them is lacking. More granular information is required for other researchers to reproduce the experiments.  \n- **Discussion of [CLS] tokens:** Figure 2 shows a minimal effect of adding image [CLS] tokens, yet the text claims this contradicts earlier work (Kim 2021; Touvron 2021) without investigating possible reasons (e.g., token alignment, fine‑tuning strategy). A deeper analysis would clarify this discrepancy.  \n- **LLM‑RadJudge discriminative power:** The RJ‑1/RJ‑2 scores are close to zero across all methods, offering little differentiation, and no comparison with radiologist judgments is provided. Further validation is needed to demonstrate the metric’s usefulness.  \n- **Reproducibility gaps:** The lack of publicly available code, trained checkpoints, random seeds, and exact prompt templates—especially for the LLM‑based metrics—does not meet the reproducibility standards expected by the journal. Addressing these gaps would be essential for future adoption.  \n\n---  \n\n## A suggested decision  \n\nReject.  \n\nThe manuscript offers a systematic analysis of classifier influence on LLM‑driven ARRG, but it falls short in terms of novelty, statistical rigor, and reproducibility. Consequently, it does not yet meet the criteria for publication in its current form.",

Overall, the paper is clearly written and systematically organized, but its methodological and statistical rigor are limited, and novelty beyond existing literature appears modest.  \n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and Contribution:** While the taxonomy of LLM‑based generators and the inclusion of new LLM‑derived metrics are helpful, the foundational concept of integrating classifier outputs with LLMs has prior precedents, reducing the perceived originality.  \n2. **Evaluation Design:** The experiments cover four datasets with varied metrics, yet lack statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, or variance estimates, which weakens the reliability of the reported improvements. Sample sizes for OOD datasets (PadChest and IU‑X‑Ray) are small and drawn from a single split, limiting generalizability.  \n3. **Validation of Proposed Metrics:** The new metrics (LLM‑RadJudge and disease‑extraction) are not supported by expert or radiologist validation, and their scores show limited discriminative capacity. Incorporating a human study would substantiate their value.  \n4. **Reproducibility Issues:** Important implementation details—random seeds, long‑tail split definitions, prompt templates, and LLM‑RadJudge configurations—are omitted, and no code or checkpoints are released, hindering replication.  \n5. **Technical Description:** The mechanisms of “expanding” and “refining” classification prompts and the handling of [CLS] tokens are insufficiently described. The limited discussion of contradictory findings relative to prior work leaves some technical claims unexplained.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The title is incomplete and potentially misleading about the work’s scope; a more descriptive phrasing is advised.  \n- Formatting and typographical inconsistencies (e.g., stray numbers, broken tables, repeated captions) reduce readability and should be corrected.  \n- Reporting statistical analyses (e.g., paired tests or bootstrapping) would support the claim of a correlation between classifier performance and report quality.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript addresses an important question regarding the role of classification in enhancing LLM‑based report generation and is commendable for its comprehensive experimental scope and clear structural taxonomy. However, the contribution is limited by modest methodological innovation, insufficient statistical validation, lack of expert evaluation, and incomplete reproducibility information. Strengthening these aspects would be essential for a convincing demonstration of the proposed approach’s value.  \n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Reject.** The study provides informative analyses but does not yet reach the required levels of novelty, statistical support, and reproducibility for publication.",

    "abstract": "The persistent challenge of medical image synthesis posed by the scarcity of annotated data and the need to synthesize \"missing modalities\" for multi-modal analysis, underscored the imperative development of effective synthesis methods. Recently, the combination of Low-Rank Adaptation (*LoRA*) with latent diffusion models (LDMs) has emerged as a viable approach for efficiently adapting pre-trained large language models, in the medical field. However, the direct application of *LoRA* assumes uniform ranking across all linear layers, overlooking the significance of different weight matrices, and leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Prior works on *LoRA* prioritize the reduction of trainable parameters, and there exists an opportunity to further tailor this adaptation process to the intricate demands of medical image synthesis. In response, we present *SeLoRA*, a Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation module, that dynamically expands its ranking across layers during training, strategically placing additional ranks on crucial layers, to allow the model to elevate synthesis quality where it matters most. Our analysis shows that *SeLoRA* strikes the best balance between synthesis quality and training efficiency. The proposed method not only enables LDMs to fine-tune on medical data efficiently but also empowers the model to achieve improved image quality with minimal ranking. The code of our *SeLoRA* method is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SeLoRA-980D.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method SeLoRA (Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation) for adapting Stable Diffusion to generate chest x-ray images. The main contribution of the paper lies in dynamically expanding the rank of LoRA during the training process, allowing it to adapt the rank according to the importance of different layers and thereby improving the quality of the synthesized images. The novelty of this approach is in using Fisher Information to guide the rank expansion, avoiding the limitations of the traditional LoRA method, which uses a \"uniform rank,\" especially when dealing with models (like Stable Diffusion) that have diverse weight matrix shapes. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SeLoRA on two chest x-ray datasets and provides detailed comparative experiments with other LoRA variants.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. \nThe papers proposes SeLoRA, a dynamic rank-expanding method using Fisher Information to guide rank expansion during fine-tuning large models with LoRA. This is novel and more applicable to models with diverse weight matrix shapes.\n2.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n3. \nThe paper is well-organized.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1.\nThe contribution is vague. As a paper focusing on adaptive parameter efficient fine-tuning methods, the paper utilizes LoRA to adapt Stable Diffusion for Chest X-ray synthesis, limiting its technical contribution. For a paper dedicated to adapting foundation model like Stable Diffusion for Chest X-ray (medical image) synthesis, the exploration is also limited and does not compare with previous work (e.g. Chambon et al., 2022a;b). Through visual comparison with image displays in Chambon et al., 2022a;b, the proposed method seems at a disadvantage.\n2.\nExperiments are conducted on relatively small datasets. Large image-report paired Chest X-ray datasets exist (e.g. MIMIC-CXR). Is this because of the heavy burden of large model like Stable Diffusion, or may be also related to the proposed method? Can the authors provide training time comparisons between SeLoRA and the compared methods? Also, as the test set of IU X-RAY and Montgomery County CXR dataset has only contains 100~200 images, the validation of the effectiveness of the method is weak.\n3.\nEvaluation and explanation are insufficient. Using a CLIP model trained purely on natural images and a maximum text token length of 76 to compute CLIP-score may not faithfully reflect how good the text-image alignment is for Chest x-ray images.\nThe training/validation/testing split is strange, could the author explain why the test set only contain 4% of the data? Are Table 1 values computed with valid data or test data? This is unclear. The paper also lacks in-depth discussion of the distribution of final rank (Figure 4,5,6) and why other LoRA methods fail on Montgomery county CXR data (Figure7). How accurate can the model generate an image given the disease or abnormal findings in the text prompt? This may be revealed using pretrained Chest X-ray classification models or manually inspect a small subset of generated results.\n\nOther non-important issues:\n4.\nthe paper title is about \"medical image syntheis”; but it only focuses on chest x-ray image.\n5.\nThe formula derivation in section3.3 is unclear.\n6.\nThe Stable Diffusion model is trained to generate a resolution of 512x512, using a resolution of 224x224 may limit the performance.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease answer the questions mentioned in the above 'weakness' section.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The paper is well organized and clearly written, though its contributions and evaluation depth require clarification.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Scope and Contribution** – The paper’s contribution appears limited. It primarily adapts existing LoRA methodology for Stable Diffusion and applies it to chest X‑ray synthesis without broad exploration or deeper analysis of adaptation mechanisms. Comparisons with prior medical‑domain diffusion studies (e.g., Chambon et al., 2022a,b) are missing; visual comparisons suggest that SeLoRA may perform less favorably.  \n2. **Dataset Scale and Validation** – Experiments rely on small datasets (IU X‑RAY, Montgomery County CXR) with only about 100–200 test images, weakening empirical validation. The authors should clarify whether dataset choice was constrained by the computational cost of Stable Diffusion or by SeLoRA itself, and report training‑time comparisons with baseline methods.  \n3. **Evaluation Metrics and Experimental Design** – The CLIP‑score, computed with a model trained on natural images and limited to 76‑token text prompts, may not accurately assess text–image alignment for medical imagery. The data split is unclear—why does the test set comprise only 4% of the data? Specify whether the results in Table 1 correspond to validation or test data. Discussion of rank distributions (Figures 4–6) and failures on Montgomery County data (Figure 7) should be expanded.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe paper present SeLoRA, a Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation module, that dynamically expands its ranking across layers during training. The proposed method increases the rank from 1 gradually. FI-Ratio and parameter \\lambda were used to determine when to expanding the rank.  The experiment is performed with stable diffusion and X-ray dataset and synthesis the X-ray image with text prompt.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper introduces a parameter-efficient method to e fine-tune stable diffusion models for generating X-ray images based on text (radiology) prompts. And the proposed method can progressive expansion in the rank of LoRA. FI-Ratio is used to guiding SeLoRA to expand its rank. The rank of different layers was given. The experiment shows the result is promisingly.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. Computational overhead. While SeLoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, its dynamic rank expansion mechanism introduces additional computational complexity. Computing Fisher information increases the overhead, which may become significant for larger datasets or more complex models.\n2. Limited dataset evaluation. Experiments were limited to two 2D X-ray datasets, with no evaluation of SeLoRA’s performance on other modalities, such as MRI or CT scans. Further validation on additional modalities would help confirm the generalizability of the method.\n3. Visual result is limited. The visual result is not satisfactory, such as in Figure 8, the contrast and details are not good.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Computational complexity analysis A comparison of training time, memory usage and FLOPs between SeLoRA, LoRA, and other variants is needed to quantify the computational trade-offs introduced by dynamic rank expansion.\n2. Evaluation on a wider range of datasets Evaluating SeLoRA on larger datasets, such as MIMIC-CXR (containing approximately 377,000 images), would provide more insights into its scalability. Future work could also validate SeLoRA on MRI, CT, or ultrasound datasets, as testing on diverse datasets would better demonstrate its robustness and versatility.\n3. Incorporating related work. The idea of dynamically adjusting the rank of the LoRA matrix in SeLoRA is conceptually similar to the recently proposed ALoRA (NAACL 2024). However, the two methods differ in implementation: ALoRA utilizes pruning and redistribution strategies, while SeLoRA relies on Fisher information as the adjustment criterion. Insights from ALoRA could provide valuable inspiration for future improvements of SeLoRA.\n4. Evaluation with medical doctor may help verify the experiment results.\nOther questions\n1. Unconventional split of the IU X-Ray dataset. The 80:16:4 split results in a relatively small test set, which could compromise the robustness of the evaluation. A more conventional split (e.g., 80:10:10) might provide more reliable insights.\n2. Small sample size in the Montgomery County CXR dataset. With only 138 samples, the Montgomery County dataset is too small for deep learning applications, which may impact the stability and generalizability of the model’s results\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI:**  \n   ✅ The manuscript presents a methodological contribution to *medical image synthesis* using diffusion-based generative models. Specifically, it introduces **SeLoRA** (Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism for adapting latent diffusion models to medical imaging tasks. The work focuses on rank-adaptive LoRA techniques, which are methodological innovations in model adaptation rather than purely application studies. The application to X-ray and histopathology image synthesis serves to validate methodological claims. Thus, the work fits well within TMI’s scope of *imaging methods and computational modeling*.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level:**  \n   The core novelty lies in introducing a **dynamic rank-expansion strategy guided by Fisher information** to improve parameter efficiency in diffusion model adaptation. Compared with prior adaptive LoRA or rank-pruning variants (DyLoRA, AdaLoRA, ALoRA), SeLoRA’s “self-expanding” mechanism is distinct — it allows rank growth rather than pruning and uses a theoretically motivated Fisher Information Ratio test. While LoRA-based adaptation itself is established, the proposed incremental-learning mechanism provides a methodological increment rather than a radical advance. The contribution is thus *moderately novel but technically meaningful and well-motivated.*\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor:**  \n   The algorithmic formulation (Equations 2–5, Algorithm 1) is clearly presented, and convergence considerations are discussed (Sec. 3.3). The evaluation is conducted on multiple public datasets (IU X-Ray, Montgomery CXR, PatchGastricADC22) and multiple resolutions, with ablation on threshold λ. Comparisons include LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA baselines with careful control of parameter counts. Metrics (FID, CLIP) and figures are standard and support conclusions. However:\n   - Datasets used are relatively small; external validation beyond X-ray (e.g., CT or MR) remains limited.\n   - Statistical significance or confidence intervals for FID are minimal.\n   - Limited reporting of computational cost beyond memory/time averages (no discussion of scalability or stability).\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation:**  \n   The manuscript is clearly structured and well-written, with sufficient mathematical detail and readable figures. Minor typographical issues (spacing, capitalization, and occasional OCR artifacts like “S ELF -EXPANDING”) should be corrected. Figures 3–6 are informative but somewhat dense; legends could better explain abbreviations (q, k, v, attn1, attn2).  \n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance:**  \n   The authors state publicly available code and use of publicly released datasets (IU X-Ray, Montgomery County CXR, PatchGastricADC22). No identifiable patient data are introduced, and dataset use appears consistent with public repository terms; IRB exemption would be appropriate. Reproducibility is adequately supported through provided hyperparameters and algorithm pseudocode.  \n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThis paper presents *SeLoRA*, a Self‑Expanding Low‑Rank Adaptation method for fine‑tuning latent diffusion models in medical image synthesis. The approach starts with a minimal rank and dynamically expands it per layer, guided by a Fisher Information Ratio (FI‑Ratio) criterion. This allows the model to allocate parameters strategically where adaptation is most beneficial. SeLoRA is applied to X‑ray and histopathology datasets for text‑to‑image synthesis, demonstrating improved Fréchet Inception Distance and CLIP scores relative to LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA while using fewer trainable parameters. The paper also analyzes rank allocation patterns and training efficiency.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Introduces a *methodologically motivated* dynamic rank‑expansion mechanism guided by Fisher Information—novel among LoRA variants.  \n- Demonstrates consistent improvements in synthesis quality and parameter efficiency.  \n- Offers theoretical intuition for convergence and empirical ablations across λ thresholds.  \n- Well‑structured, reproducible implementation with code availability.  \n- Applied to multiple medical imaging datasets and modalities, suggesting general applicability.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- The experimental datasets are relatively small; results may not generalize to larger or clinically diverse cohorts.  \n- The presented FID/CLIP improvements, while positive, are modest on certain datasets and lack statistical testing.  \n- Limited theoretical depth beyond heuristic Fisher scoring—no formal proof of optimality or convergence.  \n- Figures and tables sometimes contain formatting anomalies; some numerical results (e.g., FID 64/192 units) could be better explained.  \n- Comparison restricted to LoRA variants; missing baseline vs. full fine‑tuning or non‑LoRA PEFT methods in vision‑language diffusion settings.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Novelty Contextualization:** Clarify how SeLoRA’s Fisher‑guided expansion differs mathematically from existing ALoRA or adaptive‑rank LoRA variants. A concise comparison table would help establish novelty.  \n2. **Scalability Evaluation:** Include an experiment on a larger dataset (e.g., MIMIC‑CXR subset or similar) or a 3D imaging task to strengthen claims of general applicability.  \n3. **Ablation on FI‑Ratio Threshold and t:** Present quantitative curves of performance vs. parameter growth to better show the efficiency trade‑off.  \n4. **Uncertainty and Statistical Reporting:** Provide mean ± SD for FID/CLIP across multiple runs and confidence intervals for improvements.  \n5. **Clinical Relevance Discussion:** Expand on how synthesized images could be used in downstream clinical or training pipelines, addressing potential ethical use.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct typographical inconsistencies and OCR artifacts (e.g., “Fisher information Ratio”, “S ELF‑EXPANDING”).  \n- Improve figure readability—especially Figures 3–6—by using consistent color scales and adding legends.  \n- Ensure all dataset citations (e.g., IU X‑Ray, Montgomery CXR, PatchGastricADC22) include proper repository URLs or DOIs.  \n- Clarify units for memory/time tables and refer consistently to “GPU‑hours” or “memory (GB)”.  \n- Verify that all hyperparameters (λ, t, r) are defined upon first mention in the main text.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.**  \nThe paper presents a promising and well‑implemented methodological contribution within TMI’s scope. However, it requires additional evidence of generalizability and more rigorous comparative and statistical analysis to meet TMI’s standards for methodological maturity. With extended validation and stronger framing of novelty, SeLoRA could be a valuable addition to the literature on parameter‑efficient adaptation for medical imaging generative models.\n\n**7.

The paper is clearly organized, methodologically sound, and presents mathematical and algorithmic details with clarity.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and Differentiation:** The self‑expanding mechanism guided by Fisher information is a meaningful technical extension over existing adaptive LoRA variants. Nevertheless, the authors should clarify mathematically how this differs from other adaptive‑rank methods such as ALoRA and AdaLoRA. A concise comparative table could strengthen the novelty claim.  \n2. **Evaluation Scope:** Most experiments rely on relatively small datasets (IU X‑Ray, Montgomery CXR, PatchGastricADC22). Additional tests on larger or more clinically diverse datasets, or on 3D imaging modalities, would better establish scalability and robustness.  \n3. **Ablation and Efficiency Analysis:** The threshold parameters (λ, t) governing rank expansion warrant a more systematic analysis (e.g., performance vs. parameter growth curves).  \n4. **Statistical Reporting:** Quantitative results (FID, CLIP) should include multiple runs with mean ± standard deviation or confidence intervals to assess statistical significance.  \n5. **Clinical and Ethical Context:** The discussion could further address potential downstream uses of the synthesized images and relevant ethical considerations.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Correct typographical inconsistencies and OCR artifacts (e.g., spacing and capitalization of “Self‑Expanding”).  \n- Improve figure readability and ensure legends clearly define abbreviations.  \n- Include dataset source references (URLs or DOIs) where appropriate.  \n- Clarify units for memory and time comparisons and maintain consistent notation for parameters (λ, t, r).  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis work delivers a technically motivated and reproducible approach to adaptive low‑rank fine‑tuning for medical diffusion models. Its main strengths are methodological clarity, theoretical grounding in Fisher information, and consistent empirical improvements across multiple datasets. However, the contribution remains incremental rather than transformative, with limited experimental breadth and incomplete statistical validation. Clarifying novelty, expanding evaluation, and refining presentation would significantly strengthen the manuscript.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The paper is promising and well-executed but requires broader validation and stronger evidence of generalizability and novelty before acceptance.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents SeLoRA (Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for adapting latent diffusion models to medical image synthesis. The authors address the limitation that standard LoRA applies uniform ranking across all linear layers, which may be suboptimal for the diverse weight matrix shapes in diffusion models' U-Net architecture. SeLoRA dynamically expands ranks during training using Fisher information as a guide, starting from rank r=1 and strategically placing additional ranks on crucial layers. The method is evaluated on chest X-ray datasets (IU X-RAY and Montgomery County CXR) for text-conditioned medical image synthesis. Results show that SeLoRA achieves superior FID scores and CLIP scores compared to standard LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA while using fewer trainable parameters (Section 4, Tables 1-2). The rank allocation analysis demonstrates that SeLoRA concentrates higher ranks on attention layers where text and image embeddings interact (Figures 3-4).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - The FI-Ratio definition in Equation 5 uses inconsistent notation where the denominator should logically be larger than numerator for meaningful interpretation, but the paper suggests expansion when FI-Ratio ≥ λ > 1, creating conceptual confusion about what constitutes \"improvement\"\n  - Algorithm 1 lacks mathematical precision in the expansion condition, particularly in how the FI-Scores are computed for the expanded matrices A′ and B′ without parameter updates\n  - The convergence analysis in Section 3.3 provides only intuitive arguments without formal mathematical proof, and the approximation of FI-Ratio lacks rigorous derivation of the assumed relationship between rank and Fisher information\n\n• **Limited experimental validation and dataset scope**\n  - Evaluation is restricted to only two small chest X-ray datasets (3,955 and 138 images respectively as noted in Section 3.4), which limits generalizability claims for medical image synthesis\n  - No comparison with full fine-tuning baselines or other parameter-efficient methods beyond LoRA variants, missing important performance context for the claimed efficiency gains\n  - The PatchGastricADC22 results in Appendix show SeLoRA performing worse than LoRA on the primary FID metric (Table 6), contradicting the main narrative of consistent superiority\n  - Statistical significance testing is absent despite reporting standard deviations in Tables 1-2, making it unclear whether observed differences are statistically meaningful\n\n• **Methodological concerns and incomplete analysis**\n  - The Fisher information calculation in Equation 3 uses empirical estimation over single batches, which may be noisy and unstable for reliable expansion decisions during training\n  - Hyperparameter selection (λ=1.1, t=40) appears arbitrary with insufficient justification or sensitivity analysis beyond the limited ablation in Table 3\n  - The rank expansion strategy lacks theoretical grounding for why Fisher information should be the optimal criterion for determining when to expand, and no comparison with alternative expansion criteria is provided\n  - Missing analysis of computational overhead during training, particularly the cost of repeatedly computing FI-Scores every t steps for expansion testing\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and strengthen mathematical foundations**\n  - Reformulate the FI-Ratio definition in Equation 5 with clear explanation of why this specific ratio indicates improvement, and provide formal mathematical justification for the expansion criterion\n  - Add rigorous algorithmic details in Algorithm 1 specifying exactly how FI-Scores are computed for expanded matrices, including gradient computation procedures without parameter updates\n  - Develop formal convergence proof for the rank expansion algorithm with clear bounds, and derive the FI-Ratio approximation in Section 3.3 with explicit assumptions and mathematical steps\n\n• **Expand experimental validation comprehensively**\n  - Include evaluation on larger and more diverse medical imaging datasets beyond chest X-rays to demonstrate broader applicability across medical imaging modalities and scales\n  - Add comparisons with full fine-tuning and other PEFT methods (e.g., adapters, prompt tuning) to provide complete performance context and justify the focus on LoRA-based approaches\n  - Conduct statistical significance testing for all reported metrics and provide detailed analysis of why SeLoRA underperforms on PatchGastricADC22, addressing apparent contradictions in performance claims\n  - Report comprehensive computational analysis including training time, memory usage, and FLOPs comparison across all methods with proper statistical analysis\n\n• **Strengthen methodological rigor and theoretical justification**\n  - Investigate stability of Fisher information estimation and propose more robust alternatives, including analysis of how batch size and gradient noise affect expansion decisions\n  - Conduct thorough hyperparameter sensitivity analysis across multiple datasets and provide principled guidelines for selecting λ and t values based on dataset characteristics\n  - Compare Fisher information criterion with alternative expansion strategies (e.g., gradient magnitude, loss-based criteria) and provide theoretical analysis of why Fisher information is optimal for this task\n  - Add detailed computational cost analysis of the expansion testing procedure and propose efficiency improvements to reduce the overhead of frequent FI-Score computation",

SeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank of the low-rank decomposition matrices during training, guided by Fisher information ratios (FI-Ratios), allowing for more efficient and adaptive fine-tuning. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of SeLoRA on two datasets, IU X-Ray and Montgomery County CXR, showcasing improved synthesis quality and reduced parameter counts compared to baseline methods. The manuscript is well-written and provides a thorough analysis of the proposed approach.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning:\n   - Strength: The introduction of SeLoRA offers a unique approach to rank adjustment, leveraging Fisher information to guide rank expansion dynamically. This is a novel contribution that distinguishes the work from existing methods.\n   - Weakness: The manuscript could benefit from a more detailed comparison with other recent rank-adaptive methods, particularly those that also leverage Fisher information for rank selection. This would help clarify the unique contributions and improvements offered by SeLoRA.\n\n2. Evaluation Design:\n   - Strength: The evaluation covers multiple metrics (FID, CLIP Score) and includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses, providing a comprehensive assessment of SeLoRA's performance.\n   - Weakness: The evaluation is limited to two datasets, both of which are relatively small. Including a more diverse set of datasets, including larger and more complex medical imaging datasets, would strengthen the validation of SeLoRA's effectiveness.\n\n3. Comparisons:\n   - Strength: The manuscript compares SeLoRA against several relevant methods (LoRA, DyLoRA, AdaLoRA), demonstrating consistent improvements across different metrics.\n   - Weakness: The baseline comparisons lack a more extensive set of recent methods that also aim to optimize parameter efficiency. Including these would provide a more robust benchmark against which SeLoRA can be evaluated.\n\n4. Reproducibility:\n   - Strength: The authors state that the code will be made publicly available, which is a positive step towards reproducibility.\n   - Weakness: The methodological details, particularly regarding the training protocols and hyperparameters, are somewhat sparse. Providing more explicit details, such as the full training configurations and any preprocessing steps, would significantly enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures:\n   - Figure 2 and Figure 9 could be improved by providing more representative samples and zoomed-in regions to better illustrate the differences between methods.\n   \n2. Notation and Terminology:\n   - The notation used for the forward operator and other mathematical expressions should be consistently defined and explained.\n   \n3. Acronyms:\n   - Several acronyms (e.g., FID, CLIP) are used without definition. Adding a glossary or defining these terms in the text would improve clarity.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues:\n   - There are minor typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). These should be corrected.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\n\nThe manuscript addresses the significant challenge of medical image synthesis, particularly in the context of limited annotated data. SeLoRA introduces a novel and innovative approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LDMs by dynamically adjusting the rank of low-rank decomposition matrices. The evaluation, while comprehensive, could be strengthened by including a broader range of datasets and more recent comparative methods. The reproducibility of the method is somewhat compromised by the lack of detailed training protocols and hyperparameters. Overall, while SeLoRA shows promise, the current evidence falls short of fully meeting the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, broaden the validation across a wider range of datasets, and provide more detailed methodological descriptions to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "## SeLoRA: SELF-EXPANDING LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LATENT DIFFUSION MODEL FOR MEDICAL IMAGE SYNTHESIS\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes SeLoRA, a self-expanding Low-Rank Adaptation mechanism for fine-tuning Latent Diffusion Models (Stable Diffusion v1-5) in medical image synthesis. Instead of fixing a uniform rank across layers, SeLoRA starts with rank 1 per adapter and periodically decides whether to expand rank based on a Fisher Information (FI) ratio computed between an “original” and an “expanded” adapter configuration, aiming to concentrate capacity on layers where it is most beneficial. Experiments on IU X-Ray, Montgomery County CXR, and a histopathology patch dataset suggest SeLoRA can match or improve fidelity and text–image alignment with fewer trainable parameters than static LoRA and pruning-based variants.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntroduces a simple, modular rank-expansion mechanism that operates during training, avoiding a-priori rank selection and enabling per-layer non-uniform rank allocation.Uses an FI-based criterion to gate rank growth, aligning expansion decisions with a signal of parameter informativeness.Proposes an output-preserving expansion scheme by appending a new column to A and a zero row to B, keeping current predictions unchanged at the expansion moment.\n- Experimental rigor and validationCompares against relevant LoRA variants (LoRA, DyLoRA, AdaLoRA) on multiple datasets and resolutions.Reports performance across multiple FID feature dimensions (including intermediate Inception features) and CLIP score, with results aggregated over three seeds.Provides qualitative analyses and heatmaps showing where rank is concentrated (notably in cross-attention q/k), which is consistent with intuition about conditioning.\n- Clarity of presentationThe high-level motivation and the training loop (Algorithm 1) are easy to follow.The ablation on λ offers some insight into the aggressiveness–efficiency trade-off.Rank allocation visualizations help interpret what the method is learning.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a practical pain point for PEFT on diffusion models: non-uniform, layer-wise rank needs.If robust, the approach could be useful beyond medical synthesis (e.g., other conditional diffusion tasks) and complementary to orthogonal PEFT advances (quantization, Kroneckerized adapters, etc.).\n\n- Introduces a simple, modular rank-expansion mechanism that operates during training, avoiding a-priori rank selection and enabling per-layer non-uniform rank allocation.\n- Uses an FI-based criterion to gate rank growth, aligning expansion decisions with a signal of parameter informativeness.\n- Proposes an output-preserving expansion scheme by appending a new column to A and a zero row to B, keeping current predictions unchanged at the expansion moment.\n\n- Compares against relevant LoRA variants (LoRA, DyLoRA, AdaLoRA) on multiple datasets and resolutions.\n- Reports performance across multiple FID feature dimensions (including intermediate Inception features) and CLIP score, with results aggregated over three seeds.\n- Provides qualitative analyses and heatmaps showing where rank is concentrated (notably in cross-attention q/k), which is consistent with intuition about conditioning.\n\n- The high-level motivation and the training loop (Algorithm 1) are easy to follow.\n- The ablation on λ offers some insight into the aggressiveness–efficiency trade-off.\n- Rank allocation visualizations help interpret what the method is learning.\n\n- Addresses a practical pain point for PEFT on diffusion models: non-uniform, layer-wise rank needs.\n- If robust, the approach could be useful beyond medical synthesis (e.g., other conditional diffusion tasks) and complementary to orthogonal PEFT advances (quantization, Kroneckerized adapters, etc.).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe FI-Ratio definition and gate condition appear internally inconsistent across the text and the convergence discussion; the sign and threshold interpretation likely contain errors.With Bnew initialized to zero and K random, gradients flow to Bnew but not to K at the decision step; thus FI for the added “A-side” component is initially zero, biasing FI comparisons and potentially inducing systematic expansion regardless of utility.The convergence “upper bound” argument is heuristic and relies on an FI-Ratio that seems algebraically inverted relative to earlier definitions.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesEvaluation on very small datasets (IU X-Ray ≈4k items, Montgomery 138 images) limits generality; stronger validation on MIMIC-CXR or larger medical corpora is needed.FID with ImageNet Inception features and generic CLIP score are known to be suboptimal for medical imaging; domain-specific metrics (e.g., XRV-FID, CheXpert-based AUROC alignment, RadGraph metrics) and radiologist ratings would strengthen claims.Fairness of parameter budget comparisons is unclear when λ=1 yields large ranks (heatmaps show ranks >20–40 in some modules). Report exact trainable parameter counts per setting and ensure baselines are matched to the final SeLoRA parameter budget.No baselines against non-LoRA PEFT that performed well on diffusion (e.g., Bias Tuning, SV-Diff, DiffFit) and no recent adaptive-rank methods with expansion (ALoRA) or combined prune+expand (e.g., ElaLoRA, PrunedLoRA) on this task.Overhead of periodic FI evaluation (extra forward/backward) is not profiled in wall-clock time; only GPU memory is reported.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesConflicting statements about the FI-Ratio threshold (≥ vs ≤) and its interpretation (λ=1 “accepts any improvement”) make the core decision rule ambiguous.Some figures show unexpected colorized “X-ray” outputs for certain baselines, raising concerns about consistent preprocessing/decoding and fairness of qualitative comparisons.Data splits vary across sections (80/16/4 vs 70/10/20), and the code link is referenced but not provided.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLacks experimental comparisons to: RoentGen and Chest-Diffusion (domain-adapted diffusion pipelines), and adaptive/pruning+expansion LoRA methods (ALoRA, ElaLoRA, SubLoRA, PrunedLoRA, FLoE).

Discussion mentions some but empirical positioning is limited.\n\n### Detailed Comments\n\n- Technical soundness evaluationFI-Ratio definition and gate: Equation (5) defines FI-Ratio = FI-Scoreorig / FI-Scoreexp, yet the text states “expand when FI-Ratio ≥ λ,” and also that “λ=1 accepts any improvement.” If FIexp > FIorig signals “improvement,” then FI-Ratio < 1 should trigger expansion, not ≥. The convergence analysis then uses a formula aligned with exp/orig (not orig/exp). Please reconcile these inconsistencies and provide a formal derivation for the chosen form and inequality direction.Gradient flow at expansion: With A’ = [A K] and B’ = [B; 0], the output is unchanged, but the gradient w.r.t. K at the decision step is zero (because Bnew=0), whereas gradient w.r.t. Bnew can be non-zero (depends on xK). Consequently, the “expanded FI-Score” may understate the value of expanding A while overstating B-side utility, biasing the decision. Consider initializing Bnew to a small ε and K scaled by 1/ε to keep AB contribution ≈0 while allowing non-trivial gradients to both sides, or adopt a symmetric tiny-noise initialization for both A and B with explicit output compensation.Fisher information estimation: Empirical, diagonal FI can be noisy at small batch sizes and sensitive to scale. Without smoothing (e.g., EMA over steps) or normalization by parameter count, the comparison across different-sized layers and across time may be unstable. The paper would benefit from specifying normalization, smoothing strategies, and sensitivity analyses to batch size and t.Convergence argument: The proportionality derivation for FI-Ratio depends on average FI per parameter and ignores cross-parameter interactions; it also relies on a ratio that appears inverted relative to Eq. (5). As it stands, it is heuristic. A more careful analysis or empirical convergence evidence (rank trajectories and final rank stability under multiple seeds) would be more convincing.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentMetrics: FID based on ImageNet Inception and CLIP score are weak proxies in medical imaging. Consider domain-specific metrics used in prior work: (i) FID with in-domain encoders (e.g., DenseNet/XRV features), (ii) pathology alignment via CheXpert/XRV AUROC on synthetic images conditioned on labels, (iii) RadGraph or factENT-based text–image alignment, and (iv) radiologist blinded rating for realism/alignment.Data scale and representativeness: Results on Montgomery County CXR (n=138) can be highly variable; IU X-Ray is relatively small and heterogeneous. Stronger validation on MIMIC-CXR (as in RoentGen and Chest-Diffusion) would better support generalization claims.Fairness of parameter budgets: You report that at λ=1.1 SeLoRA uses fewer tunables than LoRA r=4, which is encouraging. However, the best scores in Table 3 (FID=76.4 at λ=1) likely use much larger total rank. Please report for every experiment: total trainable parameters, average/final rank per module group (e.g., text enc, U-Net), and show performance as a function of parameter budget.Overhead and efficiency: The periodic FI testing implies extra computation. Report wall-clock training time and overhead percentage relative to LoRA, and confirm that inference-time cost (due to increased rank) remains acceptable.Qualitative consistency: Some qualitative images appear colorized for baselines but grayscale for SeLoRA. Ensure uniform postprocessing (VAE decoding, grayscale conversion, windowing) across all methods to enable fair visual comparisons.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)RoentGen and Chest-Diffusion show that domain-adapted pipelines (larger-scale data, domain text encoders, transformer denoisers) significantly improve report-to-CXR generation. Position SeLoRA as orthogonal (PEFT) and, if possible, test SeLoRA within such pipelines to demonstrate additive benefits.Adaptive LoRA methods such as ALoRA (expansion), ElaLoRA (prune+expand with orthogonality), SubLoRA (second-order submodular pruning), and PrunedLoRA (second-order structured pruning) present alternative ways to allocate rank. Given the conceptual overlap, an empirical comparison on at least one dataset would better situate SeLoRA. Similarly, FLoE’s FI-based layer selection is related in spirit; discuss differences in FI use (per-layer gating vs constrained selection) and potential synergies.For diffusion, prior benchmarks suggest LoRA may be suboptimal relative to bias tuning, SV-Diff, or DiffFit. Including these baselines would help establish that SeLoRA improves not just over LoRA variants but also over the best-known PEFT baselines for diffusion.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceGenerating medical images raises safety, privacy, and downstream bias concerns. It would help to discuss safeguards (e.g., watermarking synthetic images), intended uses (data augmentation vs. clinical decision support), and the risks of hallucinated findings or device artifacts. Incorporating radiologist evaluation would provide practical insight into clinical viability.The idea of dynamic rank allocation guided by information-theoretic signals is promising beyond medical imaging; a brief note on generalization to other modalities and tasks could broaden impact.\n\n- FI-Ratio definition and gate: Equation (5) defines FI-Ratio = FI-Scoreorig / FI-Scoreexp, yet the text states “expand when FI-Ratio ≥ λ,” and also that “λ=1 accepts any improvement.” If FIexp > FIorig signals “improvement,” then FI-Ratio < 1 should trigger expansion, not ≥. The convergence analysis then uses a formula aligned with exp/orig (not orig/exp). Please reconcile these inconsistencies and provide a formal derivation for the chosen form and inequality direction.\n- Gradient flow at expansion: With A’ = [A K] and B’ = [B; 0], the output is unchanged, but the gradient w.r.t. K at the decision step is zero (because Bnew=0), whereas gradient w.r.t. Bnew can be non-zero (depends on xK). Consequently, the “expanded FI-Score” may understate the value of expanding A while overstating B-side utility, biasing the decision.

Stronger validation on MIMIC-CXR (as in RoentGen and Chest-Diffusion) would better support generalization claims.\n- Fairness of parameter budgets: You report that at λ=1.1 SeLoRA uses fewer tunables than LoRA r=4, which is encouraging. However, the best scores in Table 3 (FID=76.4 at λ=1) likely use much larger total rank. Please report for every experiment: total trainable parameters, average/final rank per module group (e.g., text enc, U-Net), and show performance as a function of parameter budget.\n- Overhead and efficiency: The periodic FI testing implies extra computation. Report wall-clock training time and overhead percentage relative to LoRA, and confirm that inference-time cost (due to increased rank) remains acceptable.\n- Qualitative consistency: Some qualitative images appear colorized for baselines but grayscale for SeLoRA. Ensure uniform postprocessing (VAE decoding, grayscale conversion, windowing) across all methods to enable fair visual comparisons.\n\n- RoentGen and Chest-Diffusion show that domain-adapted pipelines (larger-scale data, domain text encoders, transformer denoisers) significantly improve report-to-CXR generation. Position SeLoRA as orthogonal (PEFT) and, if possible, test SeLoRA within such pipelines to demonstrate additive benefits.\n- Adaptive LoRA methods such as ALoRA (expansion), ElaLoRA (prune+expand with orthogonality), SubLoRA (second-order submodular pruning), and PrunedLoRA (second-order structured pruning) present alternative ways to allocate rank. Given the conceptual overlap, an empirical comparison on at least one dataset would better situate SeLoRA. Similarly, FLoE’s FI-based layer selection is related in spirit; discuss differences in FI use (per-layer gating vs constrained selection) and potential synergies.\n- For diffusion, prior benchmarks suggest LoRA may be suboptimal relative to bias tuning, SV-Diff, or DiffFit. Including these baselines would help establish that SeLoRA improves not just over LoRA variants but also over the best-known PEFT baselines for diffusion.\n\n- Generating medical images raises safety, privacy, and downstream bias concerns. It would help to discuss safeguards (e.g., watermarking synthetic images), intended uses (data augmentation vs. clinical decision support), and the risks of hallucinated findings or device artifacts. Incorporating radiologist evaluation would provide practical insight into clinical viability.\n- The idea of dynamic rank allocation guided by information-theoretic signals is promising beyond medical imaging; a brief note on generalization to other modalities and tasks could broaden impact.\n\n### Questions for Authors\n\n- Please clarify the FI-Ratio definition and the expansion condition: is it FI-Ratio = FIorig / FIexp or the inverse, and do you expand when the ratio is ≤ λ or ≥ λ? How does this align with the statement that “λ=1 accepts any improvement” and with the convergence analysis formula?\n- With Bnew initialized to zero and K random, gradients at the expansion test time do not flow to K, only to Bnew. How do you ensure FIexp reflects the value of adding a new A-direction? Would a small non-zero initialization or compensated scaling for both A and B be more appropriate?\n- What is the exact computational overhead (wall-clock time per epoch and total training time) introduced by periodic FI testing across all modules compared to LoRA? How does it scale with t and model size?\n- For every reported experiment, could you provide the final total number of trainable parameters and the average/final rank distribution per module group (text encoder vs. U-Net), and confirm that baselines are matched to SeLoRA’s final budget?\n- How many images were generated for FID and CLIP score evaluations per test set and per seed? What sampling settings (number of diffusion steps, guidance scale) and random seeds were used? Were generation and FID calculation identical across methods?\n- Given known limitations of Inception-FID and generic CLIP in medical imaging, can you report in-domain metrics (e.g., XRV-FID, CheXpert AUROCs, RadGraph) or expert evaluations to corroborate improvements?\n- Figures show some colorized “X-ray” outputs for baselines. Are all methods using the same decoding and grayscale conversion? Could preprocessing differences explain some qualitative discrepancies?\n- How sensitive is SeLoRA to t (testing interval) and batch size (FI stability)? Do you use any EMA or normalization of FI across layers to reduce noise?\n- Could you release the code (the paper references “this link” but no URL is provided), data splits, and scripts to compute FI and perform expansion decisions for reproducibility?\n- Have you considered combining SeLoRA with pruning (e.g., adding a mechanism to remove unhelpful ranks) or comparing against expansion-capable baselines like ALoRA/ElaLoRA on at least one dataset?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nSeLoRA addresses a practical limitation of fixed-rank LoRA by proposing a training-time, FI-guided expansion strategy that adaptively allocates rank where it matters most. The idea is appealing, the implementation appears simple, and the qualitative rank heatmaps support the intuition that cross-attention and text-encoder q/k benefit from more capacity. However, key methodological details (FI-Ratio definition and gating condition, gradient flow through the expanded components, and the convergence argument) are currently ambiguous or internally inconsistent. Experimentally, improvements on the smallest datasets are promising but would be much more compelling with (i) domain-appropriate evaluation metrics and expert review, (ii) larger-scale validation (e.g., MIMIC-CXR), (iii) matched-parameter comparisons throughout, (iv) runtime overhead reporting, and (v) comparisons to the strongest PEFT baselines for diffusion and to recent dynamic LoRA methods that include expansion. Addressing these points would materially strengthen the paper and better position it for a top-tier venue.",

The method dynamically allocates rank during training using a Fisher Information (FI)-based criterion, enabling per-layer non-uniform expansion rather than fixed-rank adaptation. Experiments on several medical imaging datasets (IU X-Ray, Montgomery CXR, histopathology patches) indicate that SeLoRA can achieve comparable or improved fidelity and text–image alignment with fewer trainable parameters than static or pruning-based LoRA variants.

Opening Paragraph\n\nThis manuscript addresses the critical challenge of medical image synthesis in resource-constrained settings where annotated data is scarce, focusing on adapting latent diffusion models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques. The authors propose SeLoRA (Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel method that dynamically expands the rank of LoRA modules during training based on Fisher Information analysis, rather than using a uniform rank across all layers as in conventional approaches. The core innovation lies in initializing with rank=1 and strategically expanding ranks only in crucial layers where additional capacity provides meaningful improvements in synthesis quality. The authors demonstrate that SeLoRA achieves superior image fidelity (as measured by FID scores) and better text-image alignment (CLIP scores) compared to standard LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA across multiple medical imaging datasets (IU X-Ray, Montgomery County CXR, and PatchGastricADC22), while maintaining training efficiency. The method's ability to automatically allocate ranks to critical attention layers (particularly query and key weights in cross-attention mechanisms) is empirically validated through detailed rank allocation visualizations and ablation studies.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n**Major Strengths:**\n- The core concept of dynamically expanding ranks based on Fisher Information is well-motivated and addresses a genuine limitation of uniform-rank LoRA approaches when applied to the heterogeneous layer structures of medical image diffusion models\n- Comprehensive experimental validation across multiple datasets, resolutions (224×224 and 384×384), and medical imaging modalities (X-ray and histopathology) demonstrates the method's versatility\n- The rank allocation patterns shown in Figures 3-6 provide compelling evidence that SeLoRA correctly identifies critical layers (particularly cross-attention mechanisms) for rank expansion\n- Thorough memory usage analysis (Figures 11-12) and training time comparison offer practical insights for real-world implementation\n\n**Major Limitations:**\n- The paper lacks comparison with more diverse state-of-the-art medical image synthesis methods beyond LoRA variants (e.g., traditional GAN-based approaches or other diffusion model adaptations)\n- The theoretical convergence analysis (Section 3.3) is somewhat hand-wavy and would benefit from more rigorous mathematical treatment with formal proofs\n- The selection of λ=1.1 as default threshold appears arbitrary without sufficient justification for why this value works best across different datasets and modalities\n- Limited discussion of computational complexity in terms of FLOPs, which would complement the memory usage analysis\n\n**Minor Strengths:**\n- Clear visualization of the rank expansion mechanism in Figure 1\n- Inclusion of qualitative results across different medical imaging modalities (X-ray and histopathology)\n- Detailed ablation study on the impact of threshold parameter λ (Table 3)\n- Public availability of code, which enhances reproducibility\n\n**Minor Limitations:**\n- Some figures (e.g., Figure 2) would benefit from clearer annotations to highlight key differences between methods\n- The paper mentions \"more sample results in Appendix\" but doesn't specify exact locations for all supplementary materials\n- Minor inconsistencies in notation (e.g., sometimes using \"r\" for rank, sometimes not)\n- The memory usage plots (Figures 11-12) could be improved with clearer labeling of expansion events\n\n## 3. Evaluation Against TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance (High):** The work addresses a critical problem in medical imaging—the scarcity of annotated data for training deep learning models. By improving parameter-efficient fine-tuning of diffusion models for medical image synthesis, the approach has significant potential impact on enabling AI applications in resource-limited clinical settings. The application to multiple medical imaging modalities (X-ray and histopathology) further strengthens its significance for the medical imaging community.\n\n**Innovation (High):** The self-expanding rank mechanism represents a meaningful advancement beyond existing LoRA variants. The Fisher Information-based criterion for rank expansion is particularly innovative, providing an automated method to allocate resources where they matter most. The work effectively bridges concepts from efficient fine-tuning with the specific needs of medical image synthesis, where data scarcity makes parameter efficiency crucial.\n\n**Evaluation (Good):** The evaluation is comprehensive, including quantitative metrics across multiple datasets and resolutions, qualitative comparisons, memory usage analysis, and ablation studies. However, the evaluation would be strengthened by including human expert evaluation of synthesized images and comparison with a broader range of baselines beyond LoRA variants. The inclusion of higher-resolution experiments (384×384) and cross-modality validation on histopathology images demonstrates thoroughness.\n\n**Reproducibility (Good):** The paper provides sufficient implementation details, including hyperparameters, training protocols, and code availability. The inclusion of memory usage plots, training time analysis, and the worst-case training time formula (Section D.2.1) significantly enhances reproducibility. The public release of code is a strong point for reproducibility, though the paper would benefit from more specific information about the computational environment used.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Minor Revision**\n\nThe manuscript presents a novel and well-executed approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical image synthesis that makes a valuable contribution to the field. The core innovation of dynamically expanding ranks based on Fisher Information analysis is both theoretically sound and empirically validated across multiple medical imaging datasets and modalities. While the paper is generally well-written and scientifically rigorous, I recommend minor revisions to address the limitations noted above, particularly strengthening the theoretical analysis, providing more justification for the selected threshold parameter, and expanding the comparison with broader state-of-the-art methods. These revisions would further enhance the paper's impact and clarity without requiring substantial additional experimentation. The work is well-positioned for acceptance in TMI after these minor revisions.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThe manuscript tackles the well‑known problem of limited annotated medical imaging data and the consequent need to synthesize missing imaging modalities for multimodal analyses. The authors train stable‑diffusion models on several chest‑X‑ray collections – the IU X‑Ray dataset (≈ 4 k image‑report pairs), the Montgomery County CXR set (138 frontal images) – as well as on a gastric histology patch dataset. To improve efficiency, they introduce a Self‑Expanding Low‑Rank Adaptation (SeLoRA) module. SeLoRA starts with LoRA adapters of rank 1 and, during training, expands the rank of each linear layer according to a Fisher‑information‑based ratio, while a special initialization scheme (zero‑init B / random‑init A) is used to keep the model output unchanged. Across the three benchmarks, SeLoRA yields lower Fréchet Inception Distance scores and higher CLIP similarity values than the baseline LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA, while requiring fewer trainable parameters and comparable GPU memory consumption. The key contribution is a parameter‑efficient, rank‑adaptive fine‑tuning strategy for latent diffusion models in the context of medical image synthesis.\n\n---\n\n**## General feedback**\n\n- **Significance:** The paper addresses an important practical bottleneck—how to choose the rank for parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning (PEFT) when only a small amount of medical data is available. The topic is certainly relevant, although the experiments are confined to relatively small 2‑D datasets, which limits the immediate clinical impact.\n\n- **Innovation:** The authors propose a novel rule for rank expansion based on a Fisher‑information ratio, together with a zero‑initialization of the B matrix and random‑initialization of A (see Sections 3.1–3.2). While adaptive‑rank ideas have appeared before (e.g., AdaLoRA, DyLoRA, ALoRA), the manuscript does not clearly explain what theoretical advantage SeLoRA has over these existing approaches.\n\n- **Evaluation:** Three datasets and three baseline methods are examined, and the reported improvements (e.g., a ~5 % reduction in FID from 113.04 to 65.78 on IU X‑Ray, Table 1) are encouraging. However, the analysis lacks statistical testing, variance measures for SeLoRA are missing in several tables, and stronger diffusion‑specific baselines such as DreamBooth, Textual Inversion, or full‑parameter fine‑tuning are not included.\n\n- **Reproducibility:** A code repository is provided, which is commendable. Nevertheless, several critical hyper‑parameters (the Fisher‑ratio threshold λ, the testing interval t, optimizer β values) and details of the data splits are only partially described (Table 4, Section B.1). The choice of t = 40 is described as “somewhat arbitrary” without a sensitivity study, making it hard for others to reproduce the results reliably.\n\n---\n\n**## Specific comments/critiques**\n\n1. **Justification of the FI‑Ratio:** Equation 5 defines the Fisher‑information ratio used to decide when to expand ranks, but the paper offers only an empirical rationale and does not reference prior work on Fisher‑based model selection. A stronger theoretical grounding would improve confidence in this criterion.\n\n2. **Sensitivity to hyper‑parameters:** The expansion interval (t = 40) and the FI‑Ratio threshold (λ = 1.1) are presented as convenient choices (Section 3.5). Apart from a brief comparison in Table 3, there is no systematic ablation or sweep of these values, leaving the robustness of SeLoRA to such settings unclear.\n\n3. **Baseline completeness:** The study does not compare against full‑parameter fine‑tuning or recent diffusion‑specific PEFT techniques such as DreamBooth or Textual Inversion. Without these comparisons, it is difficult to ascertain whether the observed gains stem from the adaptive rank mechanism itself or simply from the larger number of trainable parameters.\n\n4. **Statistical reporting:** While standard deviations are reported for the LoRA baselines (Tables 1‑2), they are absent for SeLoRA and for the higher‑resolution experiments (Tables 5‑6). Confidence intervals or hypothesis tests would be essential to demonstrate that the improvements are statistically meaningful.\n\n5. **Clinical validation:** Figures 2, 9, and 10 showcase visually appealing results and claim better capture of pathological features. However, no blinded assessment by radiologists or pathologists is performed, so the clinical relevance of the generated images remains unverified.\n\n6. **Analysis of rank allocation:** The visualisations in Figures 3‑6 illustrate where ranks increase during training, yet the manuscript does not relate these per‑layer changes to gradient magnitudes, FI‑Score contributions, or the final FID impact. A deeper analysis would help explain why certain layers are preferred for rank expansion.\n\n7. **Memory and runtime claims:** Reported GPU‑memory savings (~0.2 GB, Table 7) and modest training‑time overhead (~2.5 % extra, Table 8) are interesting, but they are presented without measures of variability. It would be useful to see whether these benefits persist across different hardware configurations or larger models.\n\n8. **Notation inconsistencies:** Table 4 lists optimizer momentum as “β₁ = 0.9, β₂ = 0.999”, whereas Section 3.5 writes “β₁ = 0 ._ 9_, β₂ = 0 ._ 999”. The discrepancy could cause confusion and should be corrected.\n\n9. **Presentation issues:** The manuscript contains several typographical errors, broken equations, and inconsistent formatting (e.g., misplaced underscores). These issues detract from readability and may hinder reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n**## A suggested decision**\n\n**Reject**\n\n*Rationale:* Although the work presents an interesting idea for rank‑adaptive fine‑tuning of diffusion models, the current manuscript falls short of the journal’s standards. The limited experimental scope, insufficient statistical validation, incomplete baseline comparisons, and several reproducibility and presentation concerns prevent the paper from being ready for publication in its present form. Further development and more rigorous evaluation would be needed before the contribution can be considered for acceptance.",

The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM), enhanced with medical imaging capabilities (MedSAM), to refine the bounding boxes into pixel-level segmentation masks, ensuring precision in differentiating nodules from surrounding anatomy.\n\nTo address the class imbalance in CT data - where lung nodules are rare compared to healthy tissue - the framework incorporates focal loss, reducing model bias towards non-tumor areas and enhancing detection accuracy for hard-to-detect nodules. Achieving a 94.2% F1 score for bounding box prediction and a 92.4% Dice coefficient in segmentation accuracy, this pipeline demonstrates strong potential to improve clinical workflows, enhance tumor board decision-making, and contribute to better patient outcomes by streamlining nodule detection in a clinical setting.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper introduces a novel two-stage approach for lung tumor segmentation by framing the task as anomaly detection, addressing the challenges of sparse nodule identification in CT scans. This innovative structure uses a Deformable Detection Transformer (DETR) for region proposals and a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise segmentation, effectively handling class imbalance and complex image features.\n\nAdditionally, the paper’s clear, logical structure and well-explained methodology make complex concepts accessible. Detailed quantitative results further highlight the framework's effectiveness, making it a valuable and readable contribution to medical imaging and clinical decision support.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The paper’s experimental section lacks depth, with insufficient analysis to thoroughly validate the proposed method. \n\n2. There is no ablation study provided, which limits insight into how each component - such as the use of Deformable Detection Transformer (DETR), the fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM), and the customized focal loss - contributes to overall performance. Without this breakdown, it’s difficult to assess which aspects of the framework are most effective. \n\n3. The paper relies solely on quantitative evaluation, omitting any qualitative assessment, such as visual comparisons among different methods, which could provide a clearer understanding of the model's segmentation accuracy and real-world applicability.\n\n4. The presentation of results is also weak, with layout issues that detract from readability and professionalism. For instance, Table 2 extends beyond the page margin, rendering the data difficult to interpret. Additionally, there are inconsistencies and errors in in-text citations, which may confuse readers and hinder the paper’s credibility. These issues in presentation and citation detract from the paper's overall clarity and polish, suggesting the need for more careful formatting and editing. There are also several grammatical errors, which make the paper somewhat challenging to read.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Why is there only quantitative evaluation/comparison provided in the manuscript? Could you provide some qualitative results, such as visual examples of segmentation outputs, to illustrate the model’s performance?\n\n- Can you elaborate on how the class imbalance was handled during training? Were any additional strategies (besides focal loss) considered or tested to further address this issue?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 5\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nNone",

In the data preprocessing phase, Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) enhances spatial features, helping to distinguish nodules from bronchioles and vessels in CT images. Next, region proposal bounding boxes are generated using the Deformable-DETR model. In Stage 2, these bounding boxes are processed by the SAM model to achieve pixel-level segmentation. To address class imbalance within the dataset, focal loss is incorporated into the original DETR loss function. The results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 1\n\n### Strengths\n\nIn preprocessing, maximum intensity projection is applied across slices to enhance visibility. The two-stage framework, combining DETR and SAM models, offers a straightforward approach. Additionally, the common issue of class imbalance in medical datasets is addressed. As a result, segmentation performance is significantly improved. The paper is well organized.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThis manuscript lacks novel insights, as the deep learning models used in each stage are well-established, and focal loss is widely applied across various domains.

The concept of ROI-based segmentation is not new, and both DETR and SAM are well-established models. As a result, the framework appears to lack novelty, which is a critical concern.\n\n2. There are several existing studies on lung nodule segmentation in CT images. For instance, the IEEE TMI paper, \"Closing the Gap between Deep Neural Network Modeling and Biomedical Decision-Making Metrics in Segmentation via Adaptive Loss Functions,\" addresses not only lung segmentation but also class imbalance. It would be beneficial for the authors to compare or discuss their work in relation to such prior studies.\n\n3. Does the model function in an end-to-end learning manner? If it does or does not, the authors should provide a discussion on the merits and limitations of the learning method used in this framework.\n\n4.

The combination of Deformable-DETR for localization and fine-tuned SAM for pixel-level segmentation constitutes a methodological pipeline, aligning with TMI’s emphasis on imaging computation rather than clinical application alone.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level** –  \nModerate-to-strong novelty. The integration of Deformable DETR and MedSAM within a unified workflow for sparse nodule segmentation is new, especially accompanied by dedicated preprocessing (7.5mm MIP) and the use of focal loss to address extreme data imbalance. Nonetheless, each component (DETR, SAM, focal loss, MIP) is known; thus, the innovation primarily stems from architectural integration and adaptation for real-world, low-prevalence CT data. The level of methodological insight is solid but not fully foundational — best classified as a hybrid systems contribution.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor** –  \nGenerally rigorous: dataset preparation and preprocessing are transparently described; the LUNA16 dataset is correctly characterized. Proper train/validation/test splitting, balance between realism and feasibility, and inclusion of augmentation are clear strengths. Some empirical concerns remain: only a single dataset (LUNA16) was used, and no cross-dataset generalization or ablation beyond γ/α tuning is presented. The grounding in 2D MIP versus 3D context warrants further comparison. Uncertainty analysis or statistical significance testing is absent.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation** –  \nHigh clarity and polished narrative; figures are described adequately, although small inconsistencies in reference formatting and equation typography exist. Some long sentences could be edited for conciseness. The presentation style is coherent and close to IEEE standard.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance** –  \nDataset is open (LUNA16), ensuring compliance; however, there is no explicit mention of code availability or reproducibility plan.

Summary\nThis manuscript introduces a two-stage transformer-based framework for automated segmentation of lung metastases on CT. Stage 1 employs a customized Deformable DETR detector with focal loss on 7.5 mm MIP slices to propose bounding boxes, addressing tumor sparsity and class imbalance. Stage 2 refines these proposals using a fine‑tuned variant of MedSAM to generate pixel‑level masks. Tested on the LUNA16 dataset, the approach achieved a Dice ≈ 92 % and sensitivity ≈ 95 %, outperforming recent CNN‑based baselines. The work aims to integrate into tumor‑board workflows for decision support.\n\n### 2. Strengths\n- Strong alignment with current interests in transformer architectures for medical imaging.\n- Clear methodological articulation and preprocessing transparency (resampling, MIP generation, augmentation).\n- Quantitative improvement over published baselines on a standard dataset.\n- Addressing clinical realism by preserving low nodule prevalence in the test set.\n- Writing is accessible and figures assist conceptual understanding.\n\n### 3. Weaknesses\n- Limited validation: only one dataset and no external testing or cross‑comparison to human annotators.\n- Methodological innovation lies in pipeline integration rather than a new theoretical contribution.\n- Absence of ablation or sensitivity analyses (e.g., effect of MIP slab thickness, focal loss parameters, SAM fine‑tuning depth).\n- Unclear computational cost and inference time, crucial for clinical workflows.\n- Reproducibility discussion (code/data policy) lacking.\n- The “tumor‑board” framing is more aspirational than demonstrated.\n\n### 4. Major Comments\n1. **Clarify Novelty Relative to Prior DETR/SAM Applications** – The manuscript would benefit from explicitly differentiating how the joint DETR–SAM pipeline qualitatively advances beyond sequential detection‑segmentation schemes in existing literature.  \n2. **Include External or Cross‑Validation Dataset** – Demonstrating performance on at least one additional dataset (e.g., LIDC‑IDRI full set, or variation in CT reconstruction kernels) is essential for TMI to assess methodological robustness.  \n3. **Ablation and Sensitivity Analysis** – Quantify contributions from each component (MIP, focal loss, deformable attention, two‑stage structure).  \n4. **Computational Efficiency** – Provide benchmark timings (inference per scan, GPU type, memory footprint).  \n5. **Statistical Rigor** – Report confidence intervals or statistical tests across folds; a single best Dice value is insufficient at TMI standard.  \n6. **Reproducibility Statement** – Add explicit mention of code availability, trained model weights, and details sufficient for replication.  \n7. **Clinical Integration Claim** – Tone down assertions regarding “tumor board application” unless validated by user study or workflow integration trial.\n\n### 5. Minor Comments\n- Correct minor grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., “is impractical as it is time‑consuming” → streamline).  \n- Ensure consistent superscript formatting of equations and symbols.  \n- Add journal and year details to some references; check duplicated Lin et al. (2017a/2017b) citations.  \n- Figures 1–4 should include scale bars and resolution information.  \n- Re‑evaluate section numbering (minor spacing and caption formatting per IEEE guidelines).\n\n### 6. Overall Recommendation\n**Major Revision** – The paper is promising and within TMI scope but needs additional methodological validation and experimental depth (cross‑dataset testing, ablation, performance metrics) to meet TMI’s rigor and generalizability standards. If these are addressed, publication could be justified as a substantive systems innovation paper.\n\n### 7.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents a two-stage transformer-based approach for lung nodule segmentation in CT scans to support tumor board applications. The method addresses class imbalance challenges where nodules appear in only 5% of CT slices. Stage 1 employs a custom Deformable Detection Transformer with Focal Loss for region proposal to localize sparse tumors. Stage 2 uses a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM) initialized with MedSAM weights for pixel-wise segmentation refinement. The preprocessing pipeline includes 7.5mm Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) to enhance nodule visibility and differentiate nodules from vascular structures. Evaluated on LUNA16 dataset, the method achieves 92.4% Dice coefficient, 95.2% sensitivity, and 93.2% precision, with an F1 score of 94.2% for region proposal. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing CNN and hybrid CNN-transformer methods, particularly for medium and large nodules.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and notation issues**\n  - Equation (1) presents resampling factor R with inconsistent vector notation, showing R as both a vector and individual ratios without clear dimensional specification (Page 3, lines 117-120), which creates ambiguity in implementation\n  - The computational complexity formula O(H²W²C) in Section 3.3 incorrectly states C=1 for grayscale images when describing feature map channels from ResNet-50 backbone (Page 4, lines 214-216), as ResNet-50 typically outputs multi-channel feature maps\n  - Focal loss parameters γ=2 and αt=0.25 are mentioned as optimal through hyperparameter tuning (Page 7, lines 340-343) but no systematic evaluation or comparison with other parameter combinations is provided\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - Training set contains 12.7% nodule-positive images while test set has only 5% (Page 4, lines 180-184), creating a significant domain shift that may overestimate real-world performance and compromise model generalizability\n  - Stage 2 evaluation lacks independent assessment, as Table 1 shows only overall Dice coefficient of 92.4% without breakdown by nodule size categories (Page 6, Table 1), preventing detailed analysis of segmentation quality across different tumor characteristics\n  - Comparison with existing methods in Table 2 lacks statistical significance testing and confidence intervals (Page 7, Table 2), making it difficult to assess whether reported improvements are statistically meaningful\n\n• **Technical implementation and reproducibility concerns**\n  - MIP slab thickness of 7.5mm selection is mentioned as \"suitable compromise\" (Page 3, lines 138-140) but no systematic evaluation of different thickness values or quantitative justification is provided\n  - Stage 1 and Stage 2 training details are incompletely specified, with missing information about convergence criteria, early stopping, and final model selection procedures (Page 5, Section 3.5), hindering reproducibility\n  - The claim of being \"trained from scratch\" for Deformable-DETR (Page 4, line 199) contradicts the use of ResNet-50 backbone, which typically uses pre-trained weights, creating confusion about the actual training methodology\n\n• **Limited clinical validation and generalizability assessment**\n  - Evaluation is restricted to LUNA16 dataset only, with no validation on independent clinical datasets or multi-center data (throughout results section), limiting evidence for real-world tumor board applicability\n  - No analysis of computational requirements, inference time, or practical deployment considerations for clinical integration (no direct evidence found in the manuscript), despite the stated tumor board application focus\n  - Missing discussion of failure cases, edge conditions, or limitations in detecting specific nodule types or anatomical locations (no direct evidence found in the manuscript), which is crucial for clinical decision support systems\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify mathematical formulations and provide rigorous notation**\n  - Revise Equation (1) to use consistent vector notation and specify dimensional units clearly, providing implementation pseudocode to eliminate ambiguity in the resampling procedure\n  - Correct the computational complexity analysis by accurately describing the multi-channel feature maps from ResNet-50 and provide detailed complexity comparison with standard DETR\n  - Include systematic hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for focal loss parameters, showing performance curves across different γ and αt values with statistical error bars\n\n• **Strengthen experimental design and provide comprehensive evaluation**\n  - Conduct additional experiments with matched nodule prevalence between training and test sets, and report performance degradation analysis when prevalence varies to better estimate real-world applicability\n  - Provide detailed Stage 2 evaluation breakdown by nodule size categories, including per-class Dice coefficients, hausdorff distances, and boundary accuracy metrics to enable thorough segmentation quality assessment\n  - Add statistical significance testing with confidence intervals for all performance comparisons, including bootstrap sampling or cross-validation to establish statistical validity of reported improvements\n\n• **Enhance technical documentation and ensure reproducibility**\n  - Conduct systematic evaluation of MIP thickness parameters (e.g., 5mm, 7.5mm, 10mm, 15mm) with quantitative metrics showing trade-offs between nodule visibility and structural overlap\n  - Provide complete training specifications including convergence criteria, validation monitoring, learning curves, and model selection procedures, along with computational resource requirements and training time analysis\n  -

Additionally, the data augmentation strategies used during training should be better explained, especially given the class imbalance issue.\n\n4. Reproducibility: While the authors mention that the code will be made available, the manuscript lacks sufficient detail on the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters. Providing a clear and detailed description of these aspects is crucial for reproducibility. Additionally, the manuscript should include a section detailing the hardware and software requirements for replicating the experiments.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1.

Stage 1 uses a Deformable-DETR detector trained with focal loss on 7.5 mm MIP slabs to localize nodules under extreme sparsity; Stage 2 uses a fine-tuned MedSAM/SAM, prompted by Stage 1 boxes, to produce pixel-wise masks on individual slices. On a processed LUNA16-derived dataset, the authors report Stage 1 precision 93.3% and sensitivity 95.2% (IoU 0.5), and a Stage 2 Dice of 92.4%.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe two-stage decomposition (transformer-based detector for sparse region proposal, then promptable segmentation) is a pragmatic way to exploit complementary strengths, and the use of MIP to mitigate slice-level sparsity is clinically motivated.Incorporating focal loss into a transformer-based detector addresses extreme class imbalance in a targeted way and is reasonable for this domain.The pipeline design and preprocessing are clearly intended for a tumor-board application, which is a meaningful end-user context.\n- Experimental rigor and validationThe split-before-augmentation protocol is explicitly stated, and some hyperparameters for both stages are reported.Reporting stratification of detection performance by size (small/medium/large) is helpful to interpret small-nodule behavior.\n- Clarity of presentationThe overall pipeline is clearly described with helpful figures and step-by-step narrative of preprocessing (resampling, Otsu lung isolation, CLAHE, MIP).The rationale for the two-stage design is well articulated, including observations that SAM alone underperforms in highly imbalanced detection settings.\n- Significance of contributionsThe work addresses an impactful clinical task — reducing radiologist time and improving deliberations in tumor boards.If validated under standard evaluation protocols and patient-wise splits, a high-sensitivity two-stage system could be valuable as a region proposal and segmentation tool in practice.\n\nTechnical novelty and innovation\n\n- The two-stage decomposition (transformer-based detector for sparse region proposal, then promptable segmentation) is a pragmatic way to exploit complementary strengths, and the use of MIP to mitigate slice-level sparsity is clinically motivated.\n- Incorporating focal loss into a transformer-based detector addresses extreme class imbalance in a targeted way and is reasonable for this domain.\n- The pipeline design and preprocessing are clearly intended for a tumor-board application, which is a meaningful end-user context.\n\nExperimental rigor and validation\n\n- The split-before-augmentation protocol is explicitly stated, and some hyperparameters for both stages are reported.\n- Reporting stratification of detection performance by size (small/medium/large) is helpful to interpret small-nodule behavior.\n\nClarity of presentation\n\n- The overall pipeline is clearly described with helpful figures and step-by-step narrative of preprocessing (resampling, Otsu lung isolation, CLAHE, MIP).\n- The rationale for the two-stage design is well articulated, including observations that SAM alone underperforms in highly imbalanced detection settings.\n\nSignificance of contributions\n\n- The work addresses an impactful clinical task — reducing radiologist time and improving deliberations in tumor boards.\n- If validated under standard evaluation protocols and patient-wise splits, a high-sensitivity two-stage system could be valuable as a region proposal and segmentation tool in practice.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsNovelty is limited for Stage 1: the specific integration of MIP + Deformable-DETR + focal loss for sparse nodule detection has been reported (e.g., Lung-DETR), making the contribution largely incremental; the main added element here is the SAM-based Stage 2.Some technical statements are inaccurate or underspecified: for example, the self-attention complexity provided (O(H^2W^2C) with C=1) is not representative for deformable attention and backbone features are not single-channel; the loss integration with DETR’s Hungarian matching and the box-loss terms are not specified.The MIP-to-slice decoupling and prompting strategy in Stage 2 needs more detail to ensure geometric consistency and correct supervision at the slice level.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesPotential data leakage: the split is described at the slice/MIP level, not at the patient/scan level. With MIP slabs coming from the same volume, leakage across train/val/test is likely unless split is patient-wise.Non-standard evaluation for LUNA16 detection: the community uses FROC/CPM with false positives per scan;IoU@0.5precision/recall is not directly comparable and risks overstating performance.The reported dataset size after preprocessing (9,676 MIP slices across 888 scans ≈ 11 slabs/scan) is unusually small, raising concerns about slice removal rules and representativeness; clarity is needed on how many nodules and slabs per nodule are included.Baselines and ablations are insufficient: there is no comparison to standard detectors (e.g., nnDetection) under the LUNA16 protocol, no controlled ablations for CLAHE/Otsu/MIP thickness, no comparison of SAM vs a strong UNet/VNet under identical bounding-box prompts, and no 3D segmentation baseline.Stage 2 evaluation lacks detail: it is unclear whether Dice is computed per-slice, per-nodule 3D, or image-wise; per-size Dice and failure modes (e.g., juxta-pleural nodules) are not reported.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesMetrics labeling in Table 1 is confusing: “Average @ IoU 0.5 (All Areas)” with “Precision” and “Sensitivity” reads like AP/AR but is named as precision/recall; Table 2 appears to repeat Stage 1 precision/recall as “Specificity/Sensitivity,” which is not standard for detection and may be misleading for segmentation.Important architectural hyperparameters are omitted (number of encoder/decoder layers, number of queries, deformable sampling points, attention heads, feature levels), limiting reproducibility.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsClosely related methods are not compared under common protocols: nnDetection on LUNA16, tri-planar learned projection detectors, and Lung-DETR (MIP + Deformable-DETR + focal loss) should be baseline references for Stage 1.For segmentation, recent ROI-guided and MIP-aware 2D/3D methods (e.g., MESAHA-Net) should be discussed and compared, at least conceptually, and ideally empirically on volume-level Dice using standard ground truth.\n\nTechnical limitations or concerns\n\n- Novelty is limited for Stage 1: the specific integration of MIP + Deformable-DETR + focal loss for sparse nodule detection has been reported (e.g., Lung-DETR), making the contribution largely incremental; the main added element here is the SAM-based Stage 2.\n- Some technical statements are inaccurate or underspecified: for example, the self-attention complexity provided (O(H^2W^2C) with C=1) is not representative for deformable attention and backbone features are not single-channel; the loss integration with DETR’s Hungarian matching and the box-loss terms are not specified.\n- The MIP-to-slice decoupling and prompting strategy in Stage 2 needs more detail to ensure geometric consistency and correct supervision at the slice level.\n\nExperimental gaps or methodological issues\n\n- Potential data leakage: the split is described at the slice/MIP level, not at the patient/scan level.

DETR-style training typically combines classification (including a “no-object” class) with L1/GIoU losses under Hungarian matching; it is not clear how focal loss is integrated into this setup and what the relative weights are. Without this, replication and understanding of optimization behavior are difficult.The description of attention complexity conflates standard self-attention with deformable attention; deformable attention limits sampling to sparse points (with complexity closer to O(HWk) per head), which is a central justification and should be correctly stated.The MIP slab→slice mapping for Stage 2 implies that a single 2D box from a slab may correspond to a variable set of slices. The paper should specify how slices outside the slab are handled, how z-extent is determined, how boxes are cropped on slices with partial/no nodule appearance, and how negative slices within the slab contribute to training SAM.The pipeline’s lung mask erosion and removal of superior/inferior slices can suppress search space, but may also truncate juxta-pleural or apical/basal nodules; risks and safeguards should be addressed.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentSplitting and leakage: unless explicitly patient-wise, splitting MIP slabs or slices can leak highly similar content across sets. This would inflate detection and segmentation metrics. A patient-wise split is necessary; cross-validation on the official LUNA16 folds would further increase credibility.Evaluation protocol: for LUNA16 detection, FROC and CPM are standard. Reporting those, including sensitivity at FP/scan thresholds and the CPM, is essential for comparison with prior work. IoU=0.5 P/R on images is not sufficient and is not directly comparable.Segmentation evaluation should clarify whether Dice is volumetric (3D nodule masks reconstructed across slices) or averaged per-slice. Many reported baselines in Table 2 use 3D Dice on LIDC/LUNA; the current setting (MIP-driven 2D prompts) may not be directly comparable.Ablations: present controlled ablations for (a) MIP slab thickness (e.g., 3 mm vs 7.5 mm vs 10–15 mm), (b) with/without CLAHE and Otsu masks, (c) standard DETR vs Deformable-DETR vs CNN baselines under identical preprocessing, and (d) SAM vs a strong UNet/VNet segmentation head under the same box prompts. Include small-nodule (≤6–7 mm) stratified analyses in Stage 2 (Dice and detection miss rate).External validation: even a modest external test (e.g., an NLST subset or a held-out LIDC center) would help assess generalization. Without this, claims about clinical robustness are tentative.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)Lung-DETR demonstrates the exact Stage 1 combination of MIP + Deformable-DETR + focal loss on LUNA16 with similar metrics and limitations (small-nodule performance, dependency on preprocessing), highlighting limited novelty for Stage 1; the present work mainly adds a SAM-based segmentation refinement.nnDetection provides a strong, self-configuring detection baseline and reports CPM ≈ 0.93 on LUNA16; comparisons under FROC/CPM would be informative and may challenge the superiority claims.The tri-planar learned projection approach (a learned analogue to MIP combined with a U-Net segmentation head) achieves mean sensitivity ≈0.959 on LUNA16 and eliminates FP-reduction stages; it provides a pertinent alternative to fixed MIP and should be discussed as a potentially more expressive variant of Stage 1 with 2D segmentation.The DETR-in-medical-imaging study (transfer of DETR design choices) shows simpler configurations can work as well or better on LUNA16, and warns against over-complicating query init/refinement; this supports the need to report and possibly simplify the current configuration, and to provide ablations on encoder depth, feature levels, and query count.For segmentation, MESAHA-Net leverages bidirectional MIPs and ROI attention to reconstruct volumetric masks efficiently with strong Dice; this is directly related to Stage 2 and should be compared or at least positioned.CASED presents a principled curriculum and hard-negative mining strategy for extreme imbalance; it may be a complementary or alternative to focal loss worth testing or acknowledging more explicitly.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe paper’s focus on tumor-board support and realistic nodule sparsity is commendable. However, clinical relevance depends on robust, patient-wise evaluation, standard metrics (FROC/CPM), and a careful false-negative analysis for small nodules. The current preprocessing (mask erosion, slice removal) and MIP dependence may introduce failure modes (juxta-pleural/apical/basal nodules, motion, calcifications) that need explicit study.Interpretability and workflow integration: region proposals with calibrated confidence and per-nodule volumetric masks could be valuable for longitudinal monitoring. Reporting calibration metrics, per-case inference time, and human factors (review time saved) would strengthen the case for tumor-board applications.\n\nTechnical soundness evaluation\n\n- The two-stage approach is sensible, but technical details need tightening.

If not, can you re-run experiments with patient-wise splits (or the official LUNA16 folds) to rule out leakage and report FROC/CPM?\n- How exactly is focal loss integrated into the DETR training with Hungarian matching? What are the loss weights for classification vs L1/GIoU, and do you include the “no-object” class in focal loss?\n- Please specify Deformable-DETR hyperparameters: number of encoder/decoder layers, attention heads, sampling points per head, number of feature levels, number of queries, and feature map strides.\n- How do you map a 2D MIP box back to slices for SAM prompting? Do you segment all slices in the slab? How do you handle slices with no visible nodule within the slab? How is ground-truth supervision provided at the slice level (2D masks) vs volumetric masks (3D Dice)?\n- What is the precise definition of the Stage 2 Dice metric (per-slice average, per-nodule volumetric Dice, per-image)? Can you report per-size Dice and failure cases (e.g., juxta-pleural, sub-6 mm nodules)?\n- In Table 2, are “Sensitivity” and “Specificity” computed for segmentation or copied from Stage 1 detection metrics? Please clarify and ensure apples-to-apples comparisons with cited works.\n- The dataset shrinks to 9,676 MIP images (≈11 per scan). What rules caused such aggressive slice removal? How many slabs per nodule remain on average, and what fraction of nodules are excluded?\n- Did you evaluate the method under standard LUNA16 detection metrics (FROC/CPM, sensitivity at fixed FP/scan)? How does Stage 1 compare to nnDetection and to tri-planar learned projection methods?\n- For SAM fine-tuning: which components are frozen vs trainable, what learning rates/epochs were used, and what was the prompt strategy during training (boxes only, points, masks)? Any ablation vs a UNet/VNet baseline under identical prompts?\n- Can you provide ablations for MIP slab thickness, CLAHE/Otsu, and sensitivity analyses for small nodules (≤6–7 mm) including false negative examples and confusion with vessels/bronchi?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe paper addresses an important and clinically relevant problem with a sensible two-stage design and encouraging preliminary results. However, the novelty for Stage 1 is limited relative to existing work that already integrates MIP + Deformable-DETR + focal loss on LUNA16; the added value is primarily the SAM-based segmentation refinement. More critically, the evaluation as presented is not aligned with standard LUNA16 protocols, lacks a patient-wise split (raising potential leakage), and provides limited ablation and baseline comparisons. Several technical details (loss integration, architecture hyperparameters, slice-level supervision for SAM) are underspecified, and some reported metrics/tables are confusing or potentially misaligned. With a rigorous, patient-wise, FROC/CPM-based re-evaluation, clear volumetric segmentation metrics, comprehensive ablations, and comparisons to strong baselines (nnDetection, tri-planar learned projections, UNet-based segmentation), this work could become a solid, practically useful contribution for tumor-board workflows. In its current form, it reads as a promising but preliminary study and would likely need substantial experimental strengthening and clarifications for top-tier publication.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents a two-stage transformer-based pipeline for automatic segmentation of lung metastases on CT, designed to support tumor-board decision-making. Stage 1 employs a Deformable-DETR detector trained with focal loss on 7.5 mm MIP slabs to identify sparse nodules, while Stage 2 uses a fine-tuned MedSAM/SAM model, prompted by Stage 1 boxes, for pixel-level segmentation. Experiments on a processed LUNA16-derived dataset yield promising detection and segmentation metrics. The work is clearly motivated by clinical relevance, with a well-articulated rationale and detailed pipeline description. Overall, it proposes a practically oriented framework with potential clinical utility, though several methodological and evaluation issues limit its current evidential strength.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and Technical Details** – Stage 1’s design (MIP + Deformable-DETR + focal loss) largely mirrors prior work such as Lung-DETR, making the novelty incremental; the principal addition is the SAM-based segmentation refinement. Some technical descriptions are inaccurate or incomplete (e.g., attention complexity, loss integration with Hungarian matching, unspecified architectural hyperparameters). The MIP-to-slice prompting in Stage 2 lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility or assurance of geometric consistency.  \n2. **Evaluation Design and Data Splitting** – The dataset appears split at slice/MIP rather than patient level, risking leakage across sets. Standard LUNA16 metrics (FROC/CPM) are not reported, impeding fair comparison. The dataset size and slice-removal rules need clarification to assess representativeness.  \n3. **Baselines and Ablations** – The study omits crucial baselines (e.g., nnDetection, tri-planar learned projection detectors, UNet/VNet segmenters) and parameter ablations (MIP thickness, preprocessing variants, segmentation head comparison). These are necessary to understand contribution and performance robustness.  \n4. **Segmentation Metrics and Reporting** – The Dice metric definition (per-slice vs 3D) is unclear, and stage-specific metrics appear inconsistently labeled. Small-nodule and failure-case analyses are absent.  \n5. **Related Work and Reproducibility** – Closely related approaches (nnDetection, Lung-DETR, MESAHA-Net) are not convincingly compared or contextualized. Omitted model parameters hinder reproducibility.  \n6. **Potential Clinical and Methodological Risks** – Preprocessing choices (mask erosion, slab cropping) may remove clinically significant nodules. Without patient-wise evaluation and external validation, claims of clinical robustness remain tentative.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Figures and preprocessing descriptions are clear, but metrics labeling in Tables 1–2 is confusing and terminology inconsistent (precision vs AP, sensitivity vs specificity).  \n- Report all Deformable-DETR configuration details (encoder/decoder layers, heads, queries).  \n- Clarify the computation of Stage 2 Dice and whether segmentation results correspond to volumetric or slice-level targets.  \n- Discuss computational cost, per-case inference time, and calibration for tumor-board integration.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis study proposes a conceptually sound and well-described two-stage transformer pipeline with convincing clinical motivation and solid preliminary results. Its strengths lie in clear presentation, task relevance, and thoughtful sensor design choices. However, the experimental framework lacks alignment with standard protocols, adequate ablations, and baseline comparisons, while some methodological details remain underspecified. The paper would benefit substantially from patient-wise and FROC-based validation, inclusion of stronger baselines, explicit architectural parameters, and a clearer description of segmentation evaluation. At present, the contribution is promising but preliminary, requiring significantly stronger experimental evidence and clarification to meet publication standards.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**: **Major Revision**",

        "text": "# IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging Review Report\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThe manuscript addresses the critical challenge of accurately segmenting lung nodules in CT scans, which is complicated by extreme class imbalance where nodules appear sparsely among healthy tissue (typically only 0-5% of slices contain nodules). The authors propose a novel two-stage approach framing the problem as anomaly detection, where Stage 1 employs a custom Deformable Detection Transformer with Focal Loss to overcome class imbalance and localize sparse tumors, and Stage 2 refines bounding boxes into pixel-wise segmentation masks using a fine-tuned variant of Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM). To address nodule sparsity and improve spatial context, the authors incorporate a 7.5mm Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) that aids in differentiating nodules from bronchioles and vascular structures. The approach demonstrates strong performance with a Dice coefficient of 92.4%, 95.2% sensitivity, and 93.2% precision on the LUNA16 dataset, significantly outperforming existing methods as shown in their comparative analysis.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths\n- The two-stage approach effectively addresses extreme class imbalance by separating detection (Stage 1) and segmentation (Stage 2), allowing each model to operate within its strengths\n- The custom Deformable DETR architecture with Focal Loss specifically designed for sparse nodule detection represents a meaningful advancement over previous approaches\n- The integration of MIP as a preprocessing step is clinically relevant and well-justified, improving spatial context for nodule differentiation\n- The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance (92.4% Dice coefficient) that surpasses existing methods by a significant margin\n\n### Major Limitations\n- The manuscript lacks sufficient discussion on model generalizability across different CT scanner types and acquisition protocols, which is critical for clinical adoption\n- There is no detailed analysis of false positives/negatives in clinical context - what is the clinical impact of the 7.6% missed nodules, particularly for small nodules?\n- The training methodology doesn't explicitly address challenges with different nodule types (e.g., ground glass vs solid nodules), which have different clinical implications\n- The paper would benefit from an ablation study to quantify the contribution of each component (MIP, Focal Loss, etc.) to the final performance\n\n### Minor Strengths\n- Excellent visualization of the processing pipeline in Figure 1 clearly demonstrates the MIP enhancement effect\n- The architectural diagrams (Figures 2-4) provide clear, informative depictions of the two-stage approach\n- The comparison with existing methods in Table 2 is comprehensive and well-presented\n- The methodology section is well-structured with appropriate technical details\n\n### Minor Limitations\n- Stage 2 implementation details are less thoroughly described compared to Stage 1, particularly regarding SAM fine-tuning specifics\n- Figure 4 could benefit from more detailed annotations to better illustrate the model's performance on challenging cases\n- Computational time metrics are missing, which is important for evaluating clinical workflow integration potential\n- The methodology for achieving exactly 5% nodule sparsity in the test set could be described more clearly\n\n## 3. Evaluation According to TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance**: The work addresses a clinically significant problem with clear potential to improve tumor board workflows. The authors effectively justify the clinical relevance of automating lung nodule segmentation, noting how manual segmentation slows decision-making and increases resource demands. The integration of this tool into clinical tumor board settings could enhance workflow efficiency, improve patient outcomes, and reduce costs, making the work highly significant for medical imaging applications.\n\n**Innovation**: The paper presents a novel integration of transformer architectures specifically tailored for the challenge of sparse lung nodule segmentation. While individual components (Deformable DETR, SAM) have been used previously, their combination with MIP preprocessing and custom Focal Loss for this specific application represents a meaningful innovation. The two-stage approach that frames nodule segmentation as anomaly detection is particularly innovative and addresses a key limitation in existing approaches.\n\n**Evaluation**: The evaluation is generally thorough, using appropriate metrics (Dice coefficient, sensitivity, precision) on the standard LUNA16 benchmark. The comparison with existing methods in Table 2 is comprehensive and strengthens the paper's claims. However, the evaluation would benefit from more detailed analysis of failure cases, particularly for small nodules (up to 7mm), and lacks an ablation study to quantify component contributions. External validation on a different dataset would strengthen the clinical relevance claims.\n\n**Reproducibility**: The methodology is well-documented with clear descriptions of data preprocessing, network architecture, and training parameters. Specific implementation details (ResNet-50 backbone, AdamW optimizer with learning rates, batch size) are provided. However, some details for Stage 2 implementation and the exact MIP implementation parameters could be more precise. The paper would benefit from referencing code availability to enhance reproducibility.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision**\n\nWhile this paper presents a promising approach with strong performance results, several critical revisions are required before acceptance. The authors should:\n1. Provide a detailed analysis of failure cases, particularly false negatives for small nodules, with clinical context\n2. Include an ablation study to quantify the contribution of each component (MIP, Focal Loss, etc.)\n3. Address model generalizability across different CT scanner types and acquisition protocols\n4. Add computational time metrics to assess clinical workflow integration potential\n5. Clarify the specific methodology for handling different nodule types (ground glass vs solid)\n\nThe work has significant potential to advance the field and improve clinical practice, but these revisions are necessary to meet TMI's standards for clinical relevance, methodological rigor, and reproducibility. I encourage the authors to address these concerns comprehensively in their revision.",

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThe manuscript tackles the well‑known problem of severe class imbalance when segmenting lung nodules on CT, a difficulty that hampers efficient tumor‑board review. The authors work with the LUNA16 cohort (888 thoracic CT scans) which are resampled to 1 mm³ voxels and processed using Otsu thresholding, CLAHE, and a 7.5 mm maximum‑intensity projection (MIP) to make nodules more conspicuous. Their methodology consists of a two‑stage pipeline: the first stage uses a custom Deformable‑DETR trained with focal loss to generate bounding‑box proposals, and the second stage refines those boxes into voxel‑wise masks via a fine‑tuned Segment‑Anything Model (SAM) that receives the boxes as prompts. On the held‑out test set the authors report a Dice of 92.4 %, sensitivity of 95.2 % and precision of 93.3 %. The principal novelty claimed is the combination of a transformer‑based detector with a promptable segmentation model to cope with the sparsity of lung nodules in a clinically realistic workflow.\n\n---\n\n**## General feedback**\n\n- **Relevance** – The problem of extreme class imbalance (≈5 % nodule prevalence) is genuine, and an automated solution could indeed lessen manual workload during tumor‑board discussions.  \n- **Originality** – Merging Deformable‑DETR with a SAM‑style segmentation head and introducing a thin‑slice MIP as a radiologist‑inspired preprocessing step are interesting ideas.  \n- **Empirical validation** – The study is confined to a single public dataset (LUNA16). No external or multi‑center test set is provided, making it difficult to assess generalizability. Moreover, the baselines reported in Table 2 appear to be taken from earlier publications without re‑computing them on the identical split, which raises concerns about the fairness of the comparison. The manuscript also lacks any statistical testing or confidence intervals for the reported metrics.  \n- **Reproducibility** – Several crucial training details (e.g., the fine‑tuning schedule for SAM, the full set of focal‑loss hyper‑parameters, data‑augmentation specifics, random‑seed information for the split) are omitted. The authors do not make code, pretrained weights, or preprocessing scripts publicly available.\n\n---\n\n**## Specific comments/critiques**\n\n1. **Potential data leakage** – Section 3.2 states a 70/20/10 split but does not clarify whether the division is performed at the patient level or whether a fixed random seed is used. Without this information, inadvertent overlap between training and test sets cannot be ruled out.  \n2. **Baseline comparison** – Table 2 lists Dice, sensitivity and specificity for prior CNN/U‑Net approaches, yet it is unclear whether these numbers were recomputed on the same test split or copied from the original works. This ambiguity undermines the claim of superiority.  \n3. **Ablation of the MIP step** – The manuscript argues that the 7.5 mm MIP improves discrimination (Figure 1), but no experiment isolates the effect of MIP by training the pipeline without it. Consequently, the assertion remains unsupported.  \n4. **Focal‑loss tuning** – Only α = 0.25 and γ = 2 are reported as “optimal” in Section 3.6, with no description of the hyper‑parameter search or analysis of how these values influence recall for small nodules.  \n5. **SAM fine‑tuning specifics** – Section 3.5 mentions a “Dice‑CrossEntropy loss” but omits the optimizer, learning‑rate schedule, number of epochs, batch size, and the relative weighting of the two loss components. Replicating the fine‑tuning procedure is therefore impracticable.  \n6. **Statistical rigor** – Table 1 provides point estimates (Dice = 92.4 %, etc.) without confidence intervals or hypothesis testing against the baselines, leaving the statistical significance of the improvements ambiguous.  \n7. **Runtime considerations** – The claim of “efficient clinical deployment” (Section 3.5) is not backed by any measurement of inference time, GPU memory consumption, or throughput, which are essential for assessing practical feasibility.  \n8. **Performance on small nodules** – The “Small Areas” entry in Table 1 shows notably lower precision and recall, yet the manuscript offers no discussion of mitigation strategies or the potential clinical ramifications of missing small lesions.  \n9. **Availability of resources** – No statement is made regarding the release of source code, pretrained models, or an online demo. For a method that relies on transformer architectures, such transparency is increasingly expected.  \n10. **Presentation issues** – The related‑work section contains stray numbers (e.g., “054‑064”), and several figures (2–4) lack essential annotations such as scale bars or axis labels, which hampers interpretation.  \n11. **Loss weighting** – The combined Dice‑CrossEntropy loss is introduced without specifying the weighting factor that balances overlap versus boundary accuracy; this omission further obscures reproducibility.  \n12. **Data augmentation details** – While Section 3.4 mentions “basic augmentations,” it does not clarify whether rotations, scalings, or intensity perturbations were applied to the MIP images, an omission that could affect the model’s robustness to variability in clinical data.\n\n---\n\n**## A suggested decision**\n\n**Reject** – The manuscript falls short of the journal’s standards in several respects: insufficient external validation, lack of ablation studies, questionable baseline comparisons, absence of statistical significance testing, and missing reproducibility information. Addressing these deficiencies would require extensive additional experiments and documentation.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nAuthors present a method for modifying Grad-CAM feature attribution maps that is able to identify the most important 'blocks' in a 3D MRI brain image. The method is applied to output features of a trained CNN by sectioning each 3D image axis into an equal number of patches. The features from Grad-CAM are passed through a feature selection (FS) method consisting of a combination of standard library functions including recursive feature elimination (RFE). The resulting `k` ranked features are accumulated axis- (or patch-) wise, and the patches from different combinations of FS methods are passed into final step that aggregates the 2D features into 3D block features. The blocks that contain the most patches with highest ranking features are selected as the most important blocks. Authors evaluate their method by verifying that the selected blocks correspond with those that are know to be important in the literature, as well as asking Chat-GPT. Author's provide clinical reasoning to explain the attributions.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The target of the Authors' work is important and moves towards a more explainable and trustworthy result for use by clinicians.\n* Authors are thorough in their definitions and attempt to give the reader the detail to reproduce their work.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n* In general, this paper is badly formatted and overly verbose. The notation is difficult to keep consistent and often badly defined. Further comments to this are made in the `Questions` section below.\n* Authors spend very little time reviewing prior work and setting their method in context - Authors should add explanations of related prior work including methods for using statistical analysis of Grad-CAM attribution and saliency maps to identify significant regions in input data.\n* Authors inexplicably use Chat-GPT to test the reliability of their method by asking it to verify the important brain regions associated with AD - there is no explanation for this, and no reason to be doing that instead of actually asking clinicians.\n* Authors present their method only on a single 3D MRI dataset and do not discuss its applicability to other modalities, or indeed any other domain. Authors cannot claim that this is a method for \"Explainable Medical Imaging\" when results on a single dataset are reported.\n\n### Questions\n\n### Major Comments\n* The definitions and notation presented in the paper are cumbersome, and difficult to read. This starts with the statement `P (H-bar/H) x (W-bar/W) patches for P=HW` (line 92) that is repeated several times (187, 214 etc.) which could be replaced by a less obtuse definition of patch size. Authors also do not define _n_ in this Section 2. Authors should better define their variables. Additionally, the cumbersome notation in definitions 1-6 is largely unnecessary - Authors can simplify this section by removing superfluous 'definitions' and describing the process through which they yield the ranking matrices: this will avoid repetition of the `i` and `j` indices and shorten this bloated paper.\n* On a similar note, Authors introduce additional notation for the 'top feature map' `T^Q`. This terminology is confusing. It is not a top \"feature map\", but rather an aggregated \"top k features\" map combining the Grad-CAM features selected by 'some feature selection method'. Authors should consider re-wording this.\n* Lines 221-234 - Authors present their 8 steps for Image Block Ranking algorithm. This is presented badly - the reader is capable of understanding that the same steps are applied to the 3 different axis without making each step of this method so verbose. Figure 1 shows this much better in fact. Authors should describe steps 1-7 on a single axis to improve readability.\n* Authors show a visualization of important blocks identified by their method in Figure 2b. The full Grad-CAM output without feature selection is shown in Figure 3b. It is evident that applying some thresholding to the full feature map, and even just applying the brain-boundary regional constraints, would yield a similar map to their own. Can author's comment on the significant differences between using the Grad-CAM values directly in this way, rather than the additional steps in their method? It would have been helpful to show some quantitative comparison in their results given this is supposed to be an extension of Grad-CAM -based methods.\n* Why did Authors use Chat-GPT in their evaluations? What is the benefit of this over asking the clinicians which Authors repeated claim that this system is aimed at helping?\n* Have Authors used this method on other domains or modalities to demonstrate its effectiveness?\n\n### Minor Comments\n* The paragraph from lines 57 contains a lot of repetition and should be pared down: this sentiment is reflected in many parts of the paper. The reader is clear that having better explainability is important and that a clinician can use this information to inform their diagnosis.\n* Line 147 \"... makes a more impact on the decision\" - to what decision are the Authors referring?\n* Line 148 \"... we use a trained CNN to generate L heatmaps...\" - the language here is confusing: Authors are referring to the model on which they are performing Grad-CAM, not a random trained model that generates heatmaps.\n* Table 2 is unclear - why is much of the table blank?\n* Line 489 - this is confusing: what is meant by the 'the 9th ... patches are shown'?. There are 16x16 patches in each of the 3 axis images shown, and a single patch at (6, 10, 9) is highlighted.\n* Section 4.1 - it is absolutely unnecessary to bloat this section with the indicies that correspond to the brain boundary - put this in the appendix, or show it as an image if the Authors feel it adds to their explanation.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nI question the validity of using Chat-GPT in this work - but no significant Ethics concerns.",

However, the manuscript is difficult to read, poorly formatted, and lacks sufficient contextualization within prior literature.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Notation and Definitions** – The mathematical notation and definitions are cumbersome and repetitive (e.g., patch definitions and indices in Section 2). Variables such as _n_ are undefined, and many statements could be simplified. The numerous “definitions” duplicate explanations that could be described procedurally.  \n2. **Terminology Confusion** – The introduced term “top feature map” (_T^Q_) is misleading, as it represents an aggregation of top _k_ Grad-CAM features rather than an actual feature map. Clarification is needed.  \n3. **Algorithm Description** – The Image Block Ranking algorithm (lines 221–234) is overly verbose. Describing the process for one axis would suffice, as Figure 1 already conveys this clearly.  \n4. **Evaluation and Comparisons** – Figures 2b and 3b suggest that simple thresholding of Grad-CAM maps or applying anatomical masks could yield similar results. A quantitative comparison to baseline Grad-CAM maps would strengthen the evaluation.  \n5. **Use of Chat-GPT** – Employing Chat-GPT to verify brain region importance lacks justification. Consultation with clinicians would have been more appropriate given the stated clinical motivation.  \n6. **Scope and Generalizability** – The method is demonstrated only on one MRI dataset, with no discussion of performance on other modalities or domains. Claims of applicability to “Explainable Medical Imaging” are therefore overstated.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Several sections (e.g., lines 57 ff.) are repetitive and could be condensed.  \n- Lines 147–148 contain unclear phrasing about “impact on the decision” and “trained CNN to generate L heatmaps.”  \n- Table 2 is partially blank and needs explanation.  \n- Line 489 contains an unclear reference to the “9th patch.”  \n- Section 4.1 includes extensive index listings that would be better placed in an appendix or figure.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper tackles an important problem—enhancing interpretability of CNNs for medical imaging—and provides detailed implementation information. Strengths include attention to clinical motivation and reproducibility. Major weaknesses lie in presentation, clarity of notation, insufficient literature review, unnecessary methodological complexity, and limited evaluation restricted to a single dataset. The unconventional use of Chat-GPT for validation further undermines the evaluation rigor.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**: **Major Revision**",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper attempt to provide a more explainable 3D GradCam map by combining ideas of GradCam in each of the respective projections (coronal, axial, sagittal) of MRI data with feature selection concepts. The feature maps produced in the maxpooling convolutional layers are used to derive various representations such as heatmap matrics, feature matrices, and the values within them are ranked individually per view and then combined into a 3D block ranking. The authors claim the resulting visualization gives better indication of the disease and demonstrate this on ADNI data for Alzheimer's disease. \n\nThe paper is poorly written and many of the details seem to be automatically written through a translation software or perhaps LLM judging by the language used. For example, reading the abstract had a lot of details  that typically seen in results sections later rather than focusing on a high-level summary of the approach.  Another example is a sentence in line 164-165 which reads \"Different from traditional CAM-based methods without FS a new FS-Grad-CAM methods uses a FS method to select the top k features from m flattened features.\" - Is this referring to their proposed approach. Normally we would phrase it as \"Unlike traditional CAM-based methods, we propose a new method called FS-Grad_CAM where we employ a feature selection method to select the top K feature from m flattened features first before applying GradCAM.\" \n\n Many details are unclear including the novelty with respect to other 3DGradCam methods (see eblow). Overall, it needs a major rewrite and using clinically relevant terminology with better motivation of the healthcare problem addressed.\n\n### Soundness: 1\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 1\n\n### Strengths\n\nPaper is about explainable AI showing clinicians relevant features useful for diagnosis in the 3D MRI images by taking slices in multiple views and offering top-ranked patches that are correlated with disease and understand the relationship between the top blocks and the decisions made by 3D CNN. As such, the paper attempts an important problem, namely, making the disease classification more explainable to clinicians. The familiar mechanisms of GradCam are used and attempt is made to process complex MRI datasets in multiple views. If the method could be clearly explained, one could even see value in the technique for 3DGradCam in general although other 3D GradCam tools are available. The main argument appears to be that GradCam should be applied after feature selection in the feature maps.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nAs mentioned above, the paper is poorly written to determine if the idea being proposed is a variation of 3D gradCam. No comparisons are made to any methods to even see its merit. Several open questions arise (see below). \nThere are several tools available for 3DGradCam such as these. If they are not relevant for comparison, it would be helpful to at least explain how your method differs from these. \nhttps://github.com/fitushar/3D-Grad-CAM\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/357899396_Automated_grading_of_enlarged_perivascular_spaces_in_clinical_imaging_data_of_an_acute_stroke_cohort_using_an_interpretable_3D_deep_learning_framework\n\nThe paper in current problem needs a full rewrite starting with explanation of the MRI disease visualization problem, the role of existing 3D GradCam and the need for feature selection prior to GradCam. The whole idea of class activation maps was to allow us to see the rationale for the classification with the visualization itself in a way doing regional feature selection. By applying a separate feature selection operator a priori, what would be the impact on the gradient operators and the resulting activation maps?\n\nChatGPT is briefly mentioned and it is not clear what it is being used for.\nWhat does it mean to say ChatGPT is used to verify if a brain area is associated with a disease? What is the prompt used? What are the input, only text or text and image, is a bounding box and a prompt given as input. How accurate is ChatGPT in identifying  the brain areas associated with the disease. All these should be added to explain the use of ChatGPT.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. What is the rationale for a top-ranked 3Dimage block being correlated with diseases? Real-life experiences with 2d heat maps alone indicate they are not always a reliable indicator of a disease. Since a disease may be seen in some view better than other views, the method of fusion is important between the 3 views. Provide more discussion or justification for the correlation between top-ranked blocks and diseases, and the fusion method would help clarify better. \n\n2. How is the ranking of the blocks done? In general, what does ranking mean in your context, is it just a matter of selecting high-valued entries in the feature and heat map matrices?\n\n3. What is the purpose of ChatGPT in the work? It is said it is to verify if a brain area is associated with a disease. How does it work? Are both prompt text and image supplied as input? How accurate is ChatGPT in identifying  the brain areas associated with the disease. This discussion is brief and unconvincing so elaborating on how exactly ChatGPT is used and what its inputs are would explain this section better.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

It combines Grad‑CAM‑based saliency mapping in three orthogonal projections—coronal, axial, and sagittal—with a feature selection step intended to highlight the most informative activations. The goal is to provide clinicians with interpretable 3D visualizations correlating image regions to Alzheimer’s disease using ADNI data. Although the topic is important and addresses explainability in medical imaging, the current presentation is unclear and difficult to follow. Much of the phrasing appears machine‑translated or automatically generated, hindering comprehension and evaluation of the technical contribution.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Clarity and Writing Quality:** The paper requires substantial rewriting for clarity and grammatical correctness. Sentences often appear disordered or translated, obscuring meaning (e.g., lines 164–165). The abstract mixes methodological and result descriptions instead of providing a concise overview of the approach.  \n2. **Novelty and Relation to Existing Work:** The contribution relative to established 3D Grad‑CAM methods is not well delineated. The paper should clearly describe how FS‑Grad‑CAM differs from available implementations such as those cited (e.g., GitHub 3D‑Grad‑CAM repositories and prior interpretable 3D CNN frameworks).  \n3. **Justification of Feature Selection Step:** The rationale for applying feature selection prior to Grad‑CAM is insufficiently explained. Since Grad‑CAM intrinsically highlights important regions, the added value or theoretical motivation for an explicit feature selection step needs discussion.  \n4. **Evaluation and Comparisons:** No quantitative or qualitative comparison is made with baseline 3D Grad‑CAM methods, making it impossible to assess the merit of the proposed visualization.  \n5. **Use of ChatGPT:** The inclusion of ChatGPT as a verification tool is vague. The manuscript should specify what inputs (text, image, or region coordinates) are provided, the prompting method, and how correctness of the returned associations is evaluated.  \n6. **Interpretation of Ranked Blocks:** The logic linking top‑ranked 3D blocks to disease relevance and the method for fusing results across three anatomical planes require elaboration.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Define acronyms and parameters (e.g., \\(k\\), \\(m\\)) upon first use.  \n- Revise figures and captions to clarify what each heatmap or block represents.  \n- Ensure clinically appropriate terminology and consistent formatting.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe paper tackles an important problem—enhancing explainability of 3D CNNs in medical imaging—but its current presentation obscures the technical innovations and experimental validation. The central ideas of combining Grad‑CAM with feature selection could have potential if more clearly justified and empirically supported. Major rewriting, methodological clarification, and comparative evaluation are essential before the work can be properly assessed.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The study requires substantial clarification, methodological justification, and improved writing before it can be considered further.",

These ranked scores are then used to create a Block Ranking Map (BRM) via a newly developed 3D block ranking algorithm.

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript proposes new algorithms for *explainable 3D medical imaging*, including a feature‑selection‑based Grad‑CAM method, a 2D patch‑ranking algorithm, and a hybrid 3D image‑block ranking framework integrating axial, coronal, and sagittal views. These are methodological contributions to medical image analysis and visualization of learned representations—squarely within the methodological scope of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe integration of feature selection into Grad‑CAM (FS‑Grad‑CAM) and the multiview fusion of 2D patch rankings to form a 3D “Block Ranking Map” represent incremental but nontrivial extensions of existing explainability strategies.  \nHowever, the novelty is partly algorithmic engineering rather than theoretical innovation. The extensive definition of matrices and ranking functions demonstrates effort toward formalization, yet conceptual advances beyond existing explainability frameworks (e.g., Grad‑CAM++, Score‑CAM, SHAP‑CAM) are modest. Claims about clinical interpretability through ChatGPT‑assisted verification are unconventional and not well‑founded scientifically.  \n→ **Borderline for TMI novelty**: between a methodological extension and an application framework.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe manuscript includes substantial mathematical notation but limited quantitative validation. There is no ablation or statistical significance test demonstrating that FS‑Grad‑CAM or hybrid block ranking improve interpretability or classification beyond baseline CAM methods. The use of ChatGPT to “verify” brain‑region associations is not scientifically valid for peer‑reviewed evidence. Dataset use (ADNI, Autism datasets) is appropriate, but reproducibility (code, parameters, number of subjects per split, model hyperparameters) is sparse. Overall rigor is *medium*.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe paper is generally readable, yet lengthy, repetitive, and formally dense. There are numerous typographic inconsistencies (spacing, equation numbering, variable notation). Figures and tables are described but might be visually crowded. The hierarchical organization could be streamlined. English is adequate but could benefit from editing for conciseness and academic tone.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nPublic datasets (ADNI, Kaggle autism) are cited appropriately. No mention is made of IRB or subject consent, though likely not needed for secondary anonymized data. No code availability statement. Use of generative AI (“ChatGPT used to verify clinical associations”) raises *ethical and methodological concern*—should be omitted or reframed as literature-based validation only.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \nThe authors introduce a feature‑selection‑based Grad‑CAM (FS‑Grad‑CAM) to generate more interpretable 2D heatmaps by focusing on top‑ranked features, a five‑factor 2D patch‑ranking algorithm that combines multiple feature and activation matrices, and a hybrid 3D image‑block ranking approach that fuses axial, coronal, and sagittal patch rankings into a 3D Block Ranking Map (BRM). Applied to ADNI and an autism brain‑MRI dataset, the framework identifies small 3D “important blocks” purportedly associated with disease-related brain regions.\n\n2. **Strengths**\n- Addresses explainability of 3D CNNs—a current and significant challenge in medical deep learning.\n- Proposes a structured approach combining feature selection and multiview fusion.  \n- Provides detailed definitions and reproducible conceptual framework.  \n- Demonstrates feasibility on two public 3D brain‑MRI datasets.  \n- Potentially useful as a visualization and interpretability aid.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**\n- Limited scientific novelty; largely an extension of existing Grad‑CAM/Fusion ideas.  \n- Validation lacks quantitative metrics for interpretability or diagnostic utility.  \n- Reliance on ChatGPT outputs to confirm neuroanatomical associations undermines scientific rigor.  \n- The methods are excessively complicated without theoretical justification and not benchmarked against recent explainability methods.  \n- Writing and formatting need significant refinement.  \n- No error bars, cross‑validation, or statistical tests; reproducibility not demonstrated.\n\n4. **Major Comments**\n1. **Quantitative evaluation** – Include comparative experiments vs. standard Grad‑CAM, Grad‑CAM++, and other explainability methods using objective interpretability metrics or human expert assessment.  \n2. **Remove ChatGPT verification** – Replace with expert review or established neuroimaging literature only. Discussion should emphasize model‑derived findings rather than AI text confirmation.  \n3. **Ablation and Sensitivity** – Demonstrate contribution of each component: FS‑Grad‑CAM, patch ranking factors, and hybrid fusion, ideally with measurable improvement.  \n4. **Method transparency** – Provide clear mathematical formulation for the ranking function `f(·)` and weighting scheme; otherwise the method is not reproducible.  \n5. **Visualization and clarity** – Condense definitions, properly label equations, unify notation, and illustrate the pipeline with one concise figure.  \n6. **Statistical rigor** – Report classification performance with standard deviation over multiple splits and include significance tests.  \n7. **Broader applicability** – Evaluate on at least one non‑brain dataset or discuss generalization to other modalities.  \n\n5. **Minor Comments**\n- Grammar and style require editing for conciseness.  \n- Check repeated references (e.g., Zhou et al. 2024a/b).  \n- Ensure consistent variable naming in equations.  \n- Figures should have readable fonts and color legends.  \n- Provide code/parameter details in Supplementary Material.  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation:**  \n**Major Revision (borderline below TMI novelty threshold).**  \nWhile the problem is relevant and the approach is conceptually coherent, the paper in current form lacks quantitative evidence, clear methodological novelty, and professional presentation required for *IEEE TMI*. If the authors provide rigorous comparative validation, remove unscientific elements, and substantially clarify exposition, it might reach publishable quality.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** 4/5 – High confidence in assessment based on domain familiarity with deep‑learning explainability and medical imaging methods.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Statement to the Editor:**  \nThis manuscript tackles an important problem—explainable 3D deep learning in neuroimaging—through a highly detailed but somewhat convoluted ranking‑based approach. Its novelty is moderate and technical rigor insufficient for immediate acceptance at *IEEE TMI*, but with major revision focusing on quantitative and methodological soundness, it could evolve into a useful contribution to interpretability in medical imaging.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses explainability challenges in 3D medical imaging by proposing a novel ranking method for 3D image blocks. The approach combines a new FS-Grad-CAM method with feature selection to generate explainable 2D heatmaps, followed by a 2D patch ranking algorithm using five informative matrices (feature distribution, feature ranking, average feature ranking, heatmap activation, and heatmap strength matrices). The core contribution is a hybrid 3D image block ranking algorithm that integrates axial, coronal, and sagittal patch rankings to create Block Ranking Maps (BRMs). The method is evaluated on ADNI dataset (982 3D brain images) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and an autism dataset (286 3D images), achieving testing accuracies of 0.9309-0.9897. Results show that top-ranked blocks correspond to brain regions associated with AD and autism diagnosis, verified through ChatGPT and literature citations. The hybrid BRM enables visualization across three anatomical views for medical interpretation.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical notation inconsistencies and unclear formulations**\n  - Definition 6 appears twice (lines 153 and 162) with different content, creating confusion about heatmap count matrix versus average feature ranking matrix\n  - Equation complexity in Definition 5 (lines 147-150) with floor division notation µ = ⌊Ip/n⌋ lacks clear explanation of how feature index mapping works\n  - The monotonically non-decreasing function θij = f(dij, r⁰ij, r̄ij, uij, sij) in Algorithm 1 (line 225) is never explicitly defined, making reproducibility impossible\n\n• **Insufficient experimental validation and comparison**\n  - No comparison with existing 3D explainability methods beyond brief mentions of 3DGradCAM (line 176), limiting assessment of relative performance\n  - Evaluation relies heavily on subjective verification through ChatGPT and literature matching (Tables 1-2, pages 7-9) rather than quantitative explainability metrics\n  - Testing accuracies vary significantly (0.9309-0.9897, line 317) across axial/coronal/sagittal views without explanation of this variance or its impact on final rankings\n\n• **Methodological complexity without clear justification**\n  - The five-factor ranking approach (Algorithm 1, lines 216-228) lacks ablation studies showing individual factor contributions or necessity\n  - Multiple feature selection methods are combined sequentially (Chi2, mutual_info_classif, f_regression, f_classif, RFE, lines 350-356) without justification for this specific ordering\n  - Hybrid ranking requires \"different conditions\" (Algorithm 3, line 296) but these conditions are not systematically defined or validated\n\n• **Limited scope and generalizability concerns**\n  - Evaluation limited to brain imaging applications (AD and autism) without demonstration on other organ systems or pathologies\n  - Dataset preprocessing constraints (resizing to 64×64×64, extracting middle slices 22-41, lines 307-309) may not generalize to clinical workflows\n  - Heavy reliance on \"ebrains\" software tool for brain region identification (line 339) creates dependency on specific external tools\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and standardize mathematical formulations**\n  - Resolve the duplicate Definition 6 by renumbering and clearly distinguishing between heatmap count matrix and average feature ranking matrix concepts\n  - Provide explicit mathematical formulation for the ranking function θij = f(dij, r⁰ij, r̄ij, uij, sij) with specific weights or combination rules\n  - Add detailed explanation of the feature index mapping process in Definition 5, including worked examples showing how µ values translate to spatial coordinates\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation framework**\n  - Include quantitative comparisons with at least 2-3 existing 3D explainability methods using standard metrics like localization accuracy or faithfulness scores\n  - Replace subjective ChatGPT verification with established ground truth datasets or expert radiologist annotations for brain region validation\n  - Investigate and explain the accuracy variance across anatomical views, potentially through cross-validation or statistical significance testing\n\n• **Justify and validate methodological design choices**\n  - Conduct ablation studies removing individual factors from the five-factor ranking to demonstrate each component's necessity and contribution\n  - Provide theoretical or empirical justification for the specific sequential ordering of feature selection methods, or compare against alternative orderings\n  - Define the \"different conditions\" in Algorithm 3 systematically and validate their contribution to ranking stability through sensitivity analysis\n\n• **Expand evaluation scope and reduce external dependencies**\n  - Demonstrate method applicability on non-brain imaging datasets (lung, liver, or cardiac imaging) to establish broader medical imaging utility\n  - Evaluate performance under different preprocessing parameters (various resizing dimensions, slice selection strategies) to assess robustness\n  - Reduce dependency on \"ebrains\" software by incorporating alternative brain atlases or developing atlas-independent validation approaches",

The study offers a detailed technical pipeline but contains several issues in mathematical clarity, experimental design, and validation rigor.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Mathematical clarity and notation** – Duplicate Definition 6 entries appear with conflicting meanings. Equations in Definitions 5–6 and Algorithm 1 contain ambiguous notation (e.g., floor division in µ = ⌊Ip/n⌋, undefined ranking function θij = f(...)), hindering reproducibility.  \n2. **Experimental validation and comparison** – Performance results lack comparison against established 3D explainability methods beyond minimal mention of 3DGradCAM. The validation approach relies on ChatGPT‑based region verification and literature citations rather than standard quantitative metrics. Accuracy varies widely across anatomical planes without clear rationale.  \n3. **Methodological justification** – The necessity of all five ranking factors and multiple sequential feature selection methods is not demonstrated. Algorithm 3 refers to “different conditions” for hybrid ranking without formal definition or validation.  \n4. **Scope and generalizability** – Experiments are limited to brain imaging (AD and autism) and depend on fixed preprocessing (resizing, slice selection), which may restrict applicability. Heavy reliance on external “ebrains” software introduces tool‑specific constraints.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Renumber and clarify duplicated definitions.  \n- Provide explicit examples for index mapping and variable roles in equations.  \n- Improve explanation of accuracy variance and reporting format in Tables 1–2.  \n- Ensure consistent terminology across algorithms and factor names.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the paper proposes an ambitious and technically elaborate framework for interpretable 3D medical image analysis. Strengths include the hybrid integration of multi‑view rankings and a structured attempt at interpretability visualization. However, unclear mathematics, insufficient comparative evaluation, and limited methodological justification weaken the study’s rigor and reproducibility. Extending validation to other modalities and clarifying formulations would substantially strengthen the contribution.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The manuscript requires substantial clarification of formulations, strengthened quantitative validation, and justified methodological choices before it can be considered for acceptance.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript presents a novel 3D image block ranking method for explainable medical imaging, particularly for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and autism diagnosis. The proposed method integrates 2D image patch rankings from axial, coronal, and sagittal views to generate a hybrid Block Ranking Map (BRM). This BRM aims to highlight the most relevant 3D image blocks for medical diagnoses by leveraging feature selection (FS) and Grad-CAM-based heatmaps. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach using the ADNI dataset and an autism dataset, showcasing its potential for identifying key brain areas associated with these diseases.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Contribution: While the manuscript introduces a comprehensive framework for ranking 3D image blocks, it does not sufficiently contextualize its contribution relative to existing work on explainable AI in medical imaging. The authors need to clarify how their method stands out from other recent advancements in feature selection and 3D CNN interpretation, particularly those that also integrate multi-view information.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily conducted on two datasets (ADNI and autism), which limits the generalizability of the findings. Including additional datasets and varying types of medical conditions would strengthen the claim of broad applicability. Additionally, the manuscript should discuss the limitations of the current datasets and how they might affect the reliability of the results.\n\n3. Comparisons with Baselines: The manuscript lacks detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods for explainable 3D medical imaging. Including comprehensive baselines would provide a clearer picture of the method's advantages and limitations. The authors should consider including methods like 3D Grad-CAM and other explainable AI techniques that have been recently published.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript mentions that code will be made available, but the methodology section lacks sufficient detail regarding the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters used. Providing a more thorough description of these aspects is crucial for reproducibility.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 2 and 3 are somewhat cluttered and could benefit from a more focused presentation, possibly by highlighting key regions and reducing the number of displayed patches.\n   \n2. Notation Consistency: There are inconsistencies in the notation used throughout the manuscript, particularly in the mathematical sections. Standardizing these notations would enhance clarity.\n\n3. Acronyms and Terminology: Acronyms such as \"FS\" and \"BRM\" are used without initial definition, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the terminology. Providing a glossary or defining terms upon first use would be beneficial.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical errors exist throughout the manuscript, such as \"sagittal image with indices (i, j)\" instead of \"(i, j)\" being properly formatted. These should be corrected for clarity.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in explainable medical imaging by proposing a novel method for ranking 3D image blocks using multi-view 2D patches. The innovation lies in integrating feature selection and Grad-CAM-based heatmaps to generate a hybrid BRM, which can potentially aid in medical diagnosis. However, the evaluation is limited to two datasets, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings. The manuscript would benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods and clearer distinctions from prior work. Despite these limitations, the idea is promising and could contribute significantly to the field of explainable AI in medical imaging once these issues are addressed.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, broaden the scope of their validation across diverse datasets, and provide detailed methodological descriptions to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "## A New 3D Image Block Ranking Method Using Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal Image Patch Rankings for Explainable Medical Imaging\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a pipeline for explainable 3D medical imaging that ranks 3D image blocks by aggregating 2D patch rankings from axial, coronal, and sagittal views. It introduces (i) a feature-selection–aware Grad-CAM variant (FS‑Grad‑CAM), (ii) several “informative” feature/heatmap matrices, (iii) a five-factor 2D patch ranking scheme, and (iv) a hybrid 3D block ranking algorithm that averages multiple runs using different feature-selection sets. Experiments on resized ADNI MRI (three-class) and an autism dataset (binary) qualitatively map top-ranked blocks to neuroanatomical regions the authors claim are associated with AD and ASD.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationThe idea of combining planewise (axial/coronal/sagittal) patch rankings to produce a 3D block ranking map (BRM) is intuitively appealing and practical for clinicians who read 2D slices.Introducing auxiliary matrices (feature selection map, accumulation/distribution matrices, heatmap activation/strength) provides a structured vocabulary for discussing patch-level evidence.The hybrid aggregation across multiple feature-selection procedures aims to mitigate instability/bias in saliency and selection steps.\n- Experimental rigor and validationTwo datasets (ADNI, an ASD dataset) are considered, showing an intent to test generality.The framework attempts to link top-ranked blocks to brain regions via a standard brain reference tool (ebrains), which is a step toward anatomical interpretability.\n- Clarity of presentationThe pipeline is laid out in an 8-step framework figure, with named subcomponents and intermediate outputs, which helps the reader follow the intended data flow.Several definitions make explicit the objects manipulated (e.g., feature binary matrix, heatmap activation matrix).\n- Significance of contributionsExplainability for volumetric neuroimaging is an important area; any method that helps clinicians navigate 3D volumes through ranked 2D views has potential practical value.A systematic attempt to reduce saliency map clutter via feature selection before Grad‑CAM addresses a recognized pain point of CAM methods (diffuse, non-specific heatmaps).\n\n- The idea of combining planewise (axial/coronal/sagittal) patch rankings to produce a 3D block ranking map (BRM) is intuitively appealing and practical for clinicians who read 2D slices.\n- Introducing auxiliary matrices (feature selection map, accumulation/distribution matrices, heatmap activation/strength) provides a structured vocabulary for discussing patch-level evidence.\n- The hybrid aggregation across multiple feature-selection procedures aims to mitigate instability/bias in saliency and selection steps.\n\n- Two datasets (ADNI, an ASD dataset) are considered, showing an intent to test generality.\n- The framework attempts to link top-ranked blocks to brain regions via a standard brain reference tool (ebrains), which is a step toward anatomical interpretability.\n\n- The pipeline is laid out in an 8-step framework figure, with named subcomponents and intermediate outputs, which helps the reader follow the intended data flow.\n- Several definitions make explicit the objects manipulated (e.g., feature binary matrix, heatmap activation matrix).\n\n- Explainability for volumetric neuroimaging is an important area; any method that helps clinicians navigate 3D volumes through ranked 2D views has potential practical value.\n- A systematic attempt to reduce saliency map clutter via feature selection before Grad‑CAM addresses a recognized pain point of CAM methods (diffuse, non-specific heatmaps).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe core scoring functions are not specified: θij = f(dij, r^0ij, r̄ij, uij, sij) and φijk = f(θjk, θik, θij) are left undefined beyond “monotonically non-decreasing.” This makes the method unreproducible and precludes technical scrutiny of stability, calibration, and sensitivity.The FS‑Grad‑CAM formulation is not rigorously justified; it is unclear how masking to selected flattened features interacts with Grad‑CAM’s channel-wise weighting and whether the forward/backward passes are consistent with Grad‑CAM’s assumptions.Block selection requires θ from all three planes to be positive, which may systematically exclude clinically relevant blocks at the periphery or in anisotropic acquisitions.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesLikely subject leakage: the train/test splits appear to be performed at the 2D slice level (e.g., 19,640 slices, 70/30 split), so slices from the same subject may be in both sets. This can inflate reported slice-level accuracies and any downstream saliency statistics. Subject-wise splits are standard and necessary.No quantitative evaluation of localization: there is no atlas-overlap or ROI‑based metric demonstrating that top-ranked blocks concentrate in known AD/ASD regions versus random baselines or competing XAI methods. Reliance on qualitative inspection and ChatGPT assertions is inadequate for validation.No comparison to strong baselines: methods like 3D‑Grad‑CAM, AXIAL‑style 3D attention fusion, or SHAP‑based patch selection (e.g., sMRI‑PatchNet) are not compared quantitatively.Use of training data to generate heatmaps and patch rankings risks bias; cross-validated or held-out saliency generation is not described.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesNotation is often ambiguous or inconsistent (e.g., repeated definition numbers, reuse of H/W both for image size and patch size, unclear mapping from flattened features back to channels/spatial positions).The CNN architectures, training regimes, and feature-selection hyperparameters are unspecified, making replication difficult.Claims such as “more interpretable than Grad‑CAM” are not supported by quantitative metrics (e.g., region concentration, deletion/insertion curves).\n- Missing related work or comparisonsClosely related multi-plane explainability/fusion for MRI (e.g., AXIAL) and end-to-end 3D explainable models (e.g., 3D‑ResAttNet with 3D‑Grad‑CAM) are not engaged with in a comparative, quantitative way.Patch selection explainability (e.g., SHAP in sMRI‑PatchNet) is highly relevant but not directly compared; 2.5D fusion literature shows systematic approaches to leveraging multi-view context.\n\n- The core scoring functions are not specified: θij = f(dij, r^0ij, r̄ij, uij, sij) and φijk = f(θjk, θik, θij) are left undefined beyond “monotonically non-decreasing.” This makes the method unreproducible and precludes technical scrutiny of stability, calibration, and sensitivity.\n- The FS‑Grad‑CAM formulation is not rigorously justified; it is unclear how masking to selected flattened features interacts with Grad‑CAM’s channel-wise weighting and whether the forward/backward passes are consistent with Grad‑CAM’s assumptions.\n- Block selection requires θ from all three planes to be positive, which may systematically exclude clinically relevant blocks at the periphery or in anisotropic acquisitions.\n\n- Likely subject leakage: the train/test splits appear to be performed at the 2D slice level (e.g., 19,640 slices, 70/30 split), so slices from the same subject may be in both sets.

If the FS layer zeroes non-selected positions, gradients and weights computed thereafter differ from standard Grad‑CAM, potentially leading to inconsistent attributions. A formal statement of the forward pass, masking operation, and backprop path is needed.The five-factor patch score θij is central to the proposal but lacks a mathematical definition. Without normalization, weighting, or an aggregation rule (e.g., convex combination, learned weights, rank fusion), properties such as robustness to noisy heatmaps, dominance of any single factor, and calibration across planes can’t be assessed.Requiring θ > 0 across all three planes may be too strict. Consider probabilistic fusion (e.g., product/sum of normalized evidences) with confidence weighting rather than hard intersection, especially for anisotropic data or partial coverage.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentData splitting: Subject-wise split is a must (as in AXIAL and 3D‑ResAttNet). Redo all experiments with subject-level k‑fold CV to avoid leakage. The very high sagittal slice accuracy (0.9897) is a red flag for leakage.Quantitative localization: Report overlap statistics with atlases (e.g., hippocampus, parahippocampus, amygdala for AD; cerebellar and IFG regions for ASD). Metrics can include: proportion of top‑K blocks falling within pre-specified ROIs, expected hit rate vs random, and aggregated heatmap intensity within ROIs versus outside. Compare FS‑Grad‑CAM vs standard Grad‑CAM and against AXIAL‑style voxel attention fusion.Ablations: (1) With/without FS before Grad‑CAM; (2) different k values (e.g., 50, 100, 250) and their effect on sparsity and overlap metrics; (3) define and vary the θ aggregation rule; (4) with/without the “three-plane intersection” constraint; (5) effect of hybrid averaging across FS methods.External validity: For AD, evaluate with subject-wise CV and, ideally, on a separate cohort or a held-out ADNI subset (e.g., ADNI-2/3). For ASD, use a recognized dataset (e.g., ABIDE) or provide more details and QC on the Kaggle dataset, including preprocessing, motion/quality filtering.Statistical testing: When claiming region associations, include statistical comparisons (e.g., permutation tests comparing the observed count of top‑K blocks in ROI R to a null of randomly sampled blocks matched for brain coverage). Reporting p-values, CIs, and effect sizes is necessary.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)AXIAL (2407.02418) learns planewise slice importances and composes a voxel‑level 3D attention map, then quantitatively evaluates region overlap.

Please provide a precise mathematical definition, including normalization, weighting between the five factors, and any hyperparameters.\n- How exactly is φijk computed from θjk, θik, θij? Is it a product, sum, min/max, or learned fusion? How do you normalize scores across planes?\n- Were splits subject-wise or slice-wise? If slice-wise, please redo with subject-wise cross‑validation; otherwise specify the subject stratification protocol and ensure no leakage.\n- Are the heatmaps and θ/φ computed on training data or held-out data? If training data were used, how do you mitigate bias? Can you report results using only test (held-out) saliencies?\n- What is the CNN architecture used per plane (layers, channels, activation, training hyperparameters)? How were 64 feature maps obtained and why 16×16 spatial size?\n- In FS‑Grad‑CAM, do you zero non-selected features in the forward pass before computing gradients? How do you reconcile flattened feature selection with Grad‑CAM’s channel-wise weights?\n- Why require θ > 0 in all three planes for block selection? Have you evaluated soft fusion without this hard constraint, and what was the impact on localization metrics?\n- Can you provide quantitative localization results (e.g., percentage of top‑K blocks overlapping hippocampus/parahippocampus) compared to baselines (standard Grad‑CAM, AXIAL‑style attention, SHAP‑patch selection)?\n- How sensitive are the results to the choice of k (number of selected features) and to the specific sequence of feature selection methods? Any stability analysis across random seeds?\n- What preprocessing was applied to ADNI (bias field correction, registration to MNI, skull‑stripping)? How were “out-of-brain” patches determined using ebrains, and is that step reproducible?\n- For the ASD dataset, please detail dataset provenance, preprocessing, quality control, and subject-wise splits. Have you validated on ABIDE or another public dataset?\n- Will you release code and a minimal reproducible example to compute θ, φ, PRM, and BRM?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThe paper tackles an important, clinically relevant problem: producing interpretable 3D block‑level explanations from multi‑plane 2D CNN evidence. The proposed vocabulary of feature/heatmap matrices and the idea to average multiple feature-selection runs to stabilize rankings are interesting. However, in its current form the work has substantial methodological and validation gaps that prevent a rigorous assessment. Most critically, the central scoring functions are undefined, splits appear to suffer from subject leakage, FS‑Grad‑CAM is insufficiently specified, and there is no quantitative localization evaluation or comparison to strong baselines such as 3D‑Grad‑CAM, AXIAL-style multi-plane attention, or SHAP-based patch selection. The reliance on ChatGPT to support neuroanatomical claims further weakens the scientific grounding. With subject-wise evaluation, explicit definitions of θ and φ, quantitative atlas-overlap metrics, ablations, and fair baselines, the contribution could become a useful addition to explainable neuroimaging workflows. As it stands, the paper is not yet ready for a top‑tier venue but has a promising direction if the above issues are addressed.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces a framework for explainable 3D medical image analysis that ranks volumetric image blocks based on aggregated 2D rankings from axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Core contributions include a feature‑selection–aware Grad‑CAM variant (FS‑Grad‑CAM), several auxiliary feature and heatmap matrices, a five‑factor patch ranking scheme, and a hybrid aggregation over multiple feature‑selection sets. Experiments on ADNI MRI (three‑class) and an autism dataset (binary) aim to highlight blocks corresponding to disease‑related brain regions. The topic is significant and the presentation conceptually clear, employing diagrams and explicit matrix definitions that illustrate the data flow.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological specification:** The main scoring functions (θ and φ) are undefined beyond monotonicity assumptions, rendering the approach unreproducible. FS‑Grad‑CAM requires formal derivation—its interaction with Grad‑CAM’s channel‑wise weighting and the masking of flattened features is unclear. The rule requiring θ positive across all planes may omit relevant peripheral regions.  \n2. **Experimental protocol:** The reported slice‑level splits likely mix slices from the same subject across training and test sets, leading to potential data leakage and inflated accuracies. Subject‑wise cross‑validation is essential.  \n3. **Quantitative validation:** No quantitative localization metrics or region‑overlap analyses are presented. The reliance on qualitative interpretation and language‑model‑generated anatomical claims is insufficient. Region‑wise statistics or atlas‑based comparisons (e.g., hippocampus overlap) are needed.  \n4. **Baselines and ablations:** The study lacks quantitative comparisons against established alternatives such as 3D‑Grad‑CAM, AXIAL‑style attention fusion, and SHAP‑based patch selection (sMRI‑PatchNet). Ablations on feature selection, k‑parameter, and fusion rules would clarify robustness.  \n5. **Reproducibility and clarity:** CNN architectures, feature‑selection hyperparameters, and training details are not described. Notation is inconsistent, and reuse of symbols (H/W) causes confusion.  \n6. **Comparative context:** Literature on multi‑plane explainability and 2.5D fusion is cited but not systematically compared. Adopting evaluation protocols from prior work (e.g., AXIAL) would strengthen positioning.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Define all variables and normalization factors for θij and φijk.  \n- Replace qualitative descriptions with formal or tabular quantitative data.  \n- Differentiate between patch and feature dimensions in notation.  \n- Provide dataset provenance, preprocessing, and subject‑split details.  \n- Clarify whether saliency maps are generated using held‑out test data.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe study addresses an important problem—interpretable region identification in volumetric neuroimaging—through a novel multi‑plane aggregation concept. The framework’s terminology and structured pipeline aid understanding, and the idea has practical appeal for clinical interpretability. Nevertheless, core methodological ambiguities, unverified assumptions, possible data leakage, and a lack of quantitative or baseline comparisons undermine the scientific rigor required for publication. Strengthening the mathematical formulation, applying subject‑wise evaluation, and including statistical localization metrics would substantially improve the contribution.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The concept is promising and innovative, but significant methodological clarification, reproducibility detail, and quantitative validation are required before it can be considered for acceptance.",

Opening Paragraph\n\nThe paper addresses the critical challenge of interpreting 3D medical imaging results from deep learning models, specifically focusing on understanding the relationship between 3D image blocks, extracted features, and final medical diagnoses. The authors propose a novel 3D image block ranking framework that leverages 2D axial, coronal, and sagittal patch analysis to generate a Block Ranking Map (BRM) for explainable medical imaging. Their approach consists of four key components: (1) developing a new FS-Grad-CAM method with feature selection to produce more interpretable heatmaps, (2) designing a 2D image patch ranking algorithm that utilizes feature matrices and statistical information from multiple heatmaps, (3) creating a 3D image block ranking algorithm that integrates patch rankings from all three anatomical planes, and (4) developing a hybrid ranking approach that combines results from multiple feature selection methods for increased robustness. The authors demonstrate their method on two medical imaging applications—Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using the ADNI dataset and autism diagnosis—showing that their approach can successfully identify top-ranked blocks corresponding to brain regions known to be associated with these conditions. The visualizations provide clinicians with axial, coronal, and sagittal views of important blocks, facilitating more explainable diagnosis.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths:\n- The paper presents a novel and practical approach to 3D medical image interpretation by leveraging 2D slice analysis from multiple anatomical planes, which aligns better with clinical workflows than direct 3D analysis.\n- The integration of feature selection with Grad-CAM (FS-Grad-CAM) creates more interpretable heatmaps by focusing on top-ranked features rather than using all features indiscriminately.\n- The hybrid block ranking approach that combines results from multiple feature selection techniques appears methodologically sound and provides more reliable results.\n- The validation using real medical datasets (ADNI and autism dataset) with cross-verification of findings through literature review demonstrates clinical relevance.\n- The visualizations of the Block Ranking Map with multi-planar views are clinically intuitive and could be valuable for practitioners.\n\n### Major Limitations:\n- The paper lacks quantitative comparison with existing 3D explainable AI methods, making it difficult to assess the true advancement over current state-of-the-art techniques.\n- The validation methodology relies on ChatGPT for identifying disease-associated brain regions, which introduces potential bias and lacks scientific rigor; systematic literature review by domain experts would be more appropriate.\n- Insufficient details are provided about implementation (exact network architecture, training parameters, computational requirements) to ensure reproducibility.\n- There is no clinical evaluation of whether the proposed method actually improves diagnostic accuracy or clinician decision-making compared to existing approaches.\n- The paper doesn't clearly establish the clinical utility of the approach or how it would integrate into actual medical workflows.\n\n### Minor Strengths:\n- The detailed mathematical formulation of feature matrices and ranking algorithms provides strong theoretical grounding.\n- The approach of using multiple 2D views to inform 3D interpretation is intuitive and aligns well with how clinicians naturally examine medical images.\n- The figures illustrating the BRM and patch rankings are clear and effectively communicate the method's output.\n\n### Minor Limitations:\n- Some technical details in the appendices could be better integrated into the main text for improved flow.\n- Limited discussion of computational complexity and runtime performance, which would be important for clinical deployment.\n- The paper could benefit from more discussion about generalizability to other medical imaging modalities beyond brain MRI.\n- The description of the \"ebrains\" software tool integration is somewhat vague and could be clarified.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Summary\n\n### Significance:\nThe work addresses an important problem in medical AI—the need for explainable models in clinical decision-making. Understanding which regions of medical images contribute to AI diagnoses is crucial for clinical adoption. The proposed method has potential clinical significance as it provides a way to visualize and interpret 3D medical imaging results in a manner consistent with clinical anatomical thinking. However, the actual clinical impact isn't fully demonstrated, as there's no evaluation of how this method affects diagnostic accuracy or decision-making for medical professionals in practice.\n\n### Innovation:\nThe paper presents a novel approach by combining 2D patch rankings from multiple anatomical planes to generate 3D block rankings. The FS-Grad-CAM method and hybrid block ranking algorithm represent meaningful innovations. The systematic use of feature selection to improve interpretability is a key contribution. However, the innovation is more in the combination and medical application of existing techniques rather than completely novel methodologies, which somewhat limits its theoretical novelty.\n\n### Evaluation:\nThe evaluation is comprehensive in terms of technical validation on two medical datasets, showing that the method identifies brain regions associated with AD and autism. However, the evaluation has significant limitations: (1) no quantitative comparison with state-of-the-art explainable AI methods, (2) questionable methodology relying on ChatGPT for validation, (3) no clinical evaluation of utility for medical professionals, and (4) limited information about the robustness of the approach across different conditions. The quantitative results (e.g., classification accuracies) are presented but not well contextualized against existing methods.\n\n### Reproducibility:\nThe paper provides a good theoretical foundation and describes the methodology in detail, which supports reproducibility. However, significant gaps remain: (1) lack of specific implementation details (network architecture, exact training parameters), (2) the feature selection rule in Appendix A is dataset-specific and may not generalize, (3) no code or data availability statement, and (4) the complex coordinate mapping process could be described more clearly. These factors substantially reduce the reproducibility of the work.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision (reject/resubmit)**\n\nThis paper presents a promising approach to explainable 3D medical imaging with potential clinical value. The core methodology is well-structured and addresses an important problem in medical AI. However, several major issues must be addressed before the paper can be accepted:\n\n1. The authors must provide quantitative comparisons with existing 3D explainable AI methods to establish the true advancement of their approach.\n2. The reliance on ChatGPT for validation of brain region-disease associations should be replaced with rigorous systematic review methods involving medical domain experts.\n3. More detailed implementation information is required to ensure reproducibility, including network architecture details and training parameters.\n4. The clinical utility of the approach needs better demonstration, ideally with input from medical professionals regarding its practical value.\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more critical analysis of its limitations and a clearer demonstration of its advantages over existing approaches. With these improvements, the paper could make a valuable contribution to the field of explainable medical imaging. I recommend major revisions with the expectation that the authors will address these critical concerns before the manuscript can be reconsidered for publication.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the problem of interpreting how 2‑D image patches, 3‑D image blocks, feature maps, and final predictions are linked in 3‑D convolutional neural networks applied to medical imaging. By extracting axial, coronal, and sagittal slices from whole‑brain volumes, the authors propose a feature‑selection‑based Grad‑CAM (FS‑Grad‑CAM) that produces heat‑maps highlighting a limited set of highly ranked features. They then introduce a five‑component patch‑ranking scheme that evaluates patches according to feature distribution, rank, activation frequency, and strength. Scores from the three orthogonal views are merged via a 3‑D block‑ranking algorithm, and several block‑ranking outcomes are averaged to obtain a hybrid block‑ranking map (BRM). Experiments on the ADNI cohort (982 subjects) and an autism cohort (286 subjects) report classification accuracies in the range of 0.93–0.99 and list the highest‑ranking blocks, which the authors claim correspond to brain regions implicated in Alzheimer’s disease and autism. The primary claimed contributions are the FS‑Grad‑CAM heat‑map generation, the patch‑ranking procedure, and the hybrid 3‑D block‑ranking framework for producing explainable diagnoses.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:** Clarifying the decision‑making of 3‑D CNNs is certainly relevant for clinical adoption, yet the manuscript mainly assembles a collection of ad‑hoc ranking formulas. It does not advance the theory or practice of explainability in a principled way. (Abstract; Fig. 1)  \n- **Innovation:** The novelty is confined to the formal definitions (Defs 1‑6) and the five‑factor patch‑ranking rule (Alg. 1). These extensions appear incremental relative to standard Grad‑CAM and lack a solid theoretical justification or empirical motivation. (Sec. 2; Alg. 1)  \n- **Evaluation:** The reported results consist of the underlying CNN classification accuracies (0.93–0.99) and qualitative tables of “top‑ranked blocks” with their alleged anatomical relevance (Tables 1‑6, Fig. 2, Fig. 3). The study omits any baseline explainability method, quantitative localisation metric, statistical testing, or ablation analysis of the individual components. (Sec. 4)  \n- **Reproducibility:** Several essential details are absent: the exact CNN hyper‑parameters, the precise feature‑selection pipeline (the rule in App. A appears arbitrary), the code or model checkpoints, and the mapping from block indices to physical coordinates (App. C). Without these, independent replication is unlikely. (App. A‑C)  \n\n---\n\n## Specific comments/critiques  \n\n1. The manuscript introduces a series of matrices (feature‑binary, accumulation, distribution, ranking, heat‑map activation/strength) without clarifying their necessity or demonstrating how each contributes to improved interpretability. (Sec. 2)  \n2. FS‑Grad‑CAM substitutes the conventional Grad‑CAM weighting (Eq. 2‑3) but provides no empirical evidence that restricting the explanation to a reduced feature set yields more faithful or reliable heat‑maps. (Sec. 2.4)  \n3. The five‑factor patch‑ranking function \\( \\theta_{ij}=f(d_{ij},r_{ij},u_{ij},s_{ij}) \\) is described merely as “monotonically non‑decreasing”; the concrete functional form is omitted, rendering the algorithm non‑deterministic. (Alg. 1)  \n4. The selection of top‑k features (k = 250 or 100) and the order of feature‑selection methods (Chi‑square → mutual information → …) appear arbitrary. No ablation or sensitivity analysis regarding the choice of k or the FS pipeline is presented. (Sec. 4.1)  \n5. Validation relies on visual inspection of heat‑maps (Fig. 2) and manual literature lookup to link blocks with brain regions (Tables 1, 2). No quantitative localisation metric (e.g., intersection‑over‑union with expert‑annotated ROIs) or statistical significance testing is reported. (Fig. 2; Tables 1‑2)  \n6. The manuscript mentions using ChatGPT to “verify” the relevance of identified brain regions. The prompts, validation of the model’s responses, and the impact of this step on scientific rigor are not disclosed. (Sec. 4.2)  \n7. There is no comparison with established explainability approaches such as vanilla Grad‑CAM, 3‑D Grad‑CAM, attention‑based maps, or SHAP, precluding any assessment of the purported advantage of the hybrid BRM. (Abstract; Fig. 1)  \n8. Computational cost and runtime of the multi‑stage pipeline (feature selection, FS‑Grad‑CAM, patch ranking, block aggregation) are omitted, yet such information is crucial for evaluating clinical feasibility. (Missing performance data)  \n9. The authors do not provide code, model weights, or detailed preprocessing specifications (voxel spacing, intensity normalisation, train‑test splits), which is inconsistent with the reproducibility expectations of *Medical Image Analysis*. (App. B‑C)  \n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Reject**  \n\n*Rationale:* The manuscript does not offer a sufficiently novel methodological contribution, and its evaluation lacks the rigor, quantitative analysis, and comparative baselines required to substantiate the claimed benefits. Moreover, the absence of critical implementation details severely undermines reproducibility.",

How could biological or mechanistic understanding arise from generative models in your context? Can you expand and provide a stronger motivation for this idea?\n2. You mention that \"GANs often struggle with generating coherent latent representations.\" Since GANs do not inherently produce latent representations in the same way as e.g. Variational Autoencoders, could you clarify what \"coherent latent representations\" means in the context of GANs, and how this specifically relates to your proposed method's advantages?\n3. The claim that multiple color channels can be treated as distinct modalities is not clearly explained in my opinion but is crucial to the suggested method. Do you have examples from related work where color channels have been treated as distinct modalities? Could you explain the biological basis for considering cell and nucleus channels as separate modalities?\n4. In Equation 1, are the variables h,w,d the same dimensions as H,W,D? If not, what is their relationship? Similarly, in Equation 2, the depth dimension d seems to be omitted—was this intentional or a typo? Please add a brief explanation of these variables and their relationships directly after the equations.\n5. How does the simultaneous recovery of both channels relate specifically to latent diffusion? Can you provide a specific example or illustration of how the simultaneous recovery process works in your model, and how it differs from standard latent diffusion approaches?\n6. What is the reason for using unquantized embeddings in your framework? If they drift from the codebook vectors, how does this affect the model, and what is the underlying motivation?\n7. In Equation 12, the variable t should be defined. Additionally, in Equation 13, what exactly is μ_θ_cn(⋅) computing—only the mean or is there an associated variance? If not, what is the variance of your Gaussian?\n8. There is an existing WNet in medical imaging literature [1]. To avoid confusion, would you consider renaming your model?\n9. Can you provide more precise details about your dual-channel 3D architecture, perhaps with references or a schematic in the supplementary material?\n10. On page 6, you state that attention mechanisms are \"strategically placed\" to focus on regions of interest. Could you elaborate on the strategy behind their placement and how regions of interest are determined?\n11. The numerical differences in Table 1 are hard to interpret without context. Could you explain or hint to what these differences mean in terms of image quality and their significance in your application? Can you provide a brief interpretation guide for the FID and MMD scores, perhaps indicating what range of differences would be considered significant in this context? You could also include a qualitative comparison of images corresponding to different score ranges to help readers understand the practical implications of these differences.\n12. Could you provide more context about the ResNet50 model used—for instance, what type of medical images it was trained on?\n\n**Additional Feedback for Improvement:**\n\n- In Figure 1, please explain what the rows and columns represent to enhance understanding.\n- In the introduction, you mention that \"single-cell data is often high-dimensional and inconsistent in size.\" Could you clarify whether this inconsistency refers to the images, cells, biological structures, or image resolutions?\n- In the Related Work section, the statement about discriminative frameworks needing a \"deep understanding of the underlying input distribution\" is unclear. Providing an example or reference could help clarify this point.\n- It might be beneficial to first introduce and describe the dataset before delving into implementation details like volume padding.\n- Please specify the size and resolution of the microscopy images. Are the single-cell images crops from larger stacks, or are they the direct output from the microscope?\n- Consider citing relevant works such as the 3D U-Net architecture [2] to situate your work within the existing literature.\n- The conclusion would be stronger if it discussed potential methodological developments and acknowledged limitations of the current approach.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The model captures the relation between the nuclear and cytoplasmic channels used for model training when generating the simulated images and presents a high spatial resolution of the images. The authors benchmarked the model against already available models like GAN-based models and MedicalDiffusion, useful for 3D image generation for the same test case, and found the best overall model performance.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe model outperforms existing models, generating nuanced morphological changes due to perturbations like drug treatments. Compared to existing models, it can also accurately capture the 3D resolved morphology of the cellular tags. The model is best at generating cellular data and matches real data.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe model captures the morphological changes associated with the perturbations it has been trained on but has not yet been shown to be generalizable to different cell types and drug treatments. This has been marked as a future prospect of the study. This is important in biological studies as tagging and imaging the markers are expensive for generating training data and a very important domain where biology communities would benefit.\n\n### Questions\n\nThe metrics used to evaluate the model are good for evaluating the overall model performance. But do the metrics evaluate the inter- and intra-channel prediction accuracy? The authors stated that it is biologically relevant and an improvement brought by the work. But how can you evaluate this specific aspect using relevant metrics from a biological point of view?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The approach seeks to combine the generative power of diffusion processes with the compact representation capacity of VQ-GANs. While the concept is promising, the manuscript’s clarity could be improved, and there are substantive concerns regarding the assumptions about microscopy data, the scope of results, and the choice and interpretation of evaluation metrics.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Assumptions about microscopy image data:** The paper assumes microscopy images typically contain only two channels (cells and nuclei), which is inaccurate. Many datasets—such as Cell Painting (JUMP, CHAMMI), the Human Protein Atlas, and virtual staining datasets—include multiple channels capturing diverse organelles and subcellular compartments. The authors’ limited framing suggests insufficient consideration of the broader range of microscopy data types.  \n2. **3D generation claim:** Despite the claim of presenting a 3D generative model for microscopy imaging, the paper only shows 2D data. To substantiate the claim, the authors should include orthogonal slices or other evidence of generated 3D volumes.  \n3. **Evaluation metrics and interpretation:** The use of Fréchet Inception Distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy is standard, but the authors do not explain how these metrics respond to common GAN failure modes, such as hallucinated cellular structures. Clarifying this relationship would strengthen the evaluation.  \n4. **Methodological clarity:** The role of diffusion during inference and its effect on the quantized codebook is unclear. A clearer description or schematic would improve reproducibility. Additionally, it should be specified whether the approach depends on a fixed number of input channels.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The manuscript would benefit from improved description of implementation steps and figures to clarify the workflow between the VQ-GAN and diffusion components.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, the submission proposes a potentially useful integration of diffusion models with vector-quantized GANs for microscopy image generation. The innovation lies in the combination strategy, which could improve representational accuracy. However, the work currently suffers from questionable assumptions about input data, unsubstantiated claims regarding 3D results, and insufficient methodological detail.

        "text": "**Phase 1: Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI – ✅**\n   The paper presents a new generative modeling framework for multichannel 3D fluorescence microscopy, integrating vector quantization (VQ) with diffusion models to synthesize realistic volumetric cellular images. The methodological emphasis on multichannel latent diffusion and inter-channel consistency places it squarely within TMI’s methodological domain, particularly under *imaging physics/AI-based image formation, synthesis, and reconstruction*.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level – Moderate to Strong**\n   - The **“library of codebooks”** for separate biological channels combined with a **multichannel diffusion stage** is a novel integration not previously reported in 3D cell imagery synthesis.\n   - The pragmatic innovation lies in demonstrating *joint-channel generative modeling* for cell and nucleus morphology under drug perturbations.\n   - While the technical blocks (VQGAN, DDPM, UNet) are established, their combination for *multichannel 3D biological imaging* is distinctive and offers generalizable methodological value.\n   - Novelty is more architectural and conceptual rather than theoretical; however, it is sufficient for TMI if rigorously validated.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor – Good but with Gaps**\n   - Experiments are systematic: dataset description is clear; baselines and metrics are standard (FID, MMD using Med3D features).\n   - Implementation details and ablations are comprehensive.\n   - Missing aspects: uncertainty quantification, statistical significance testing, and evaluation of biological validity beyond pixel-level similarity (e.g., morphological metrics or expert scoring). Dataset splits are consistent, but no external validation set.\n   - Ethical clarity on dataset provenance (cell line, IRB, data sharing license) could be strengthened.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation – Very Good**\n   - The manuscript is clearly structured with logical flow and meticulous mathematical description.\n   - Figures are likely informative (though text indicates heavy visual content).\n   - Minor typographic and stylistic issues (spacing, capitalization, figure referencing).\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance – Partially Addressed**\n   - GitHub link placeholder suggests intention for open code release.\n   - Dataset origin (melanoma cells) is described but without explicit IRB or licensing statement.\n   - No mention of code availability assurance under anonymization review.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe manuscript, *“Build Your Own Cell: Diffusion Models for Multichannel 3D Microscopy Image Generation,”* introduces BYOC — a generative framework combining VQGAN encoding with a multichannel 3D diffusion process. The model uses independent codebooks for each biological channel (cell, nucleus) and jointly denoises these latent spaces via a dual-channel 3D UNet in the diffusion loop. Evaluations on a 7k-cell light-sheet fluorescence dataset of drug-treated melanoma cells demonstrate that BYOC outperforms GAN-based and diffusion-based baselines (HA-GAN, α-GAN, MedicalDiffusion) on quantitative similarity metrics (FID, MMD) and yields visually realistic multi-channel 3D reconstructions. Ablation experiments confirm the benefit of channel-specific codebooks for morphological consistency.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological contribution integrating vector quantization and conditional diffusion into a multichannel 3D framework.\n- Comprehensive experimental setup with multiple baselines and ablation studies.\n- Strong qualitative demonstrations of biologically faithful reconstructions across different drug treatments.\n- Potentially impactful for in-silico high-throughput phenotyping and drug-screening applications.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Biological validation remains limited to visual inspection and distribution-level metrics; lacks expert annotation or morphological feature comparison.\n- Evaluation confined to one cell line and specific drug treatments — limited generalizability.\n- No uncertainty analysis or robustness study (e.g., to noise, resolution changes).\n- Insufficient discussion of computational scalability and inference time, relevant for translational use.\n- Ethical/compliance clarifications are minimal (dataset license, data sharing, human/animal sample policy).\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Validation Beyond Distribution Metrics:**  \n   Extend evaluation with domain-relevant morphological descriptors (e.g., cell/nucleus volume ratios, shape descriptors) or expert morphological score comparisons. This would strengthen biomedical relevance.  \n2. **Dataset and Compliance Clarification:**  \n   Include explicit details on dataset availability, ethical approval (if needed for biological specimens), and licensing terms.  \n3. **Code and Reproducibility:**  \n   Confirm that training and inference code (VQGAN + DDPM pipeline) will be made available; current placeholder link is insufficient for TMI reproducibility standards.  \n4. **Generalizability and Scalability:**  \n   Discuss limitations for other modalities (e.g., confocal, electron microscopy) and computational resource demands.  \n5. **Quantitative Uncertainty and Repeatability:**  \n   Consider assessing variance across multiple random seeds or training repeats to ensure stability given small batch sizes.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct typographical inconsistencies (e.g., “D IFFUSION,” “C ¸ ic ¸ek”) and unify capitalization.  \n- Figure numbering and captions should be concise and self-contained.  \n- Include clear axis labels and units for all quantitative plots.  \n- Reference formatting should adhere to IEEE style (currently hybrid arXiv/journal forms).  \n- Clarify how 3D FID/MMD was computed (feature extraction pipeline).\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation – Major Revision**  \nThe work presents a promising, methodologically meaningful step forward in 3D multichannel biomedical image generation, fitting IEEE TMI’s methodological innovation scope. However, additional experimental validation and stronger reproducibility/ethical transparency are required before acceptance.\n\n**7. Confidence Level – 4/5**  \nThe methodological domain and evaluation strategies are within the reviewer’s expertise; confidence is high in assessing novelty and rigor, moderate for biological relevance interpretations.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Recommendation:**  \n▶ **Major Revision** — The framework is innovative and potentially impactful but needs bolstered validation (morphological realism assessment, reproducibility details) and improved ethical/data disclosure to meet IEEE TMI expectations.",

The method addresses the challenge of generating high-resolution 3D cell and nucleus volumes that maintain inter-channel consistency and biological accuracy. BYOC combines vector quantization using a library of channel-specific codebooks with multichannel diffusion models. The approach uses adapted VQGAN architecture to learn separate codebooks for cell and nucleus channels (Section 3.1), followed by a DualChannelUNet-based diffusion process to generate coherent multichannel volumes (Section 3.2). The authors evaluate their method on over 7,083 metastatic melanoma cells treated with three different drugs, demonstrating superior performance compared to baselines including MedicalDiffusion, HA-GAN, and W-GAN across FID and MMD metrics (Table 1). The framework aims to enable high-throughput in silico drug screening and morphological analysis.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical Formulation Inconsistencies**\n  - Equation 1 contains a clear error where both encoded representations are defined as E(xnuc), when one should be E(xcell), compromising mathematical clarity and reproducibility\n  - The notation switches inconsistently between ˆz and zq without clear distinction in meaning (Equations 3-4)\n  - The joint reverse process notation pθzˆqcell zˆqnuc lacks proper mathematical formatting and subscript clarity (Section 3.2)\n\n• **Limited Experimental Validation Scope**\n  - Dataset restricted to single cell type (melanoma) and only three drug treatments, limiting generalizability claims made in the abstract and introduction\n  - No comparison with recent 3D medical generation methods beyond MedicalDiffusion (2023), missing important baselines from the evolving field\n  - Evaluation metrics (FID, MMD) computed on averaged channels rather than preserving multichannel structure, potentially masking inter-channel consistency issues (Section 4.3)\n  - Cross-validation details mentioned in Table 1 but methodology not described in Section 4.1\n\n• **Technical Architecture Justification Gaps**\n  - No ablation study comparing the proposed DualChannelUNet against standard 3D UNet architectures for multichannel processing\n  - Library of codebooks concept lacks comparison with joint multichannel codebook approaches beyond the basic \"unimodal\" baseline (Figure 6)\n  - Missing analysis of computational overhead introduced by separate codebooks versus unified representations\n  - Spatial and depth-wise attention mechanisms mentioned (Section 3.2) but no evaluation of their specific contribution\n\n• **Biological Validation Deficiencies**\n  - No quantitative analysis of biological plausibility metrics such as nucleus-to-cell volume ratios or spatial positioning accuracy\n  - Generated samples show \"slightly smoother\" fine details (page 8) but this degradation is not quantitatively assessed\n  - Claims of \"biologically realistic\" synthesis lack validation from domain experts or comparison with established biological morphology benchmarks\n  - Inter-channel consistency evaluation relies only on visual inspection rather than quantitative spatial relationship metrics\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Correct Mathematical Formulations**\n  - Fix Equation 1 to properly define ẑcell = E(xcell) and ẑnuc = E(xnuc) with consistent notation throughout\n  - Standardize notation between ẑ and zq with clear definitions of when each representation is used\n  - Reformat the joint reverse process notation with proper mathematical typesetting and clear subscript definitions\n\n• **Expand Experimental Validation**\n  - Include additional cell types and drug treatments to demonstrate generalizability across biological contexts\n  - Add comparisons with recent 3D generative methods and multichannel synthesis approaches from 2023-2024 literature\n  - Compute FID and MMD metrics on full multichannel volumes rather than channel-averaged versions to properly assess inter-channel consistency\n  - Provide detailed cross-validation methodology and statistical significance testing\n\n• **Strengthen Technical Justification**\n  - Conduct ablation studies comparing DualChannelUNet against standard 3D UNet with multichannel inputs\n  - Compare library of codebooks against joint multichannel codebook learning with multiple architectural variants\n  - Report computational costs and memory requirements for separate versus unified codebook approaches\n  - Quantitatively evaluate the contribution of spatial and depth-wise attention mechanisms through targeted ablations\n\n• **Enhance Biological Validation**\n  - Implement quantitative biological metrics such as nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, spatial positioning accuracy, and morphological feature preservation\n  - Quantify the \"smoother details\" observation with texture and fine-structure preservation metrics\n  - Collaborate with cell biology experts for qualitative validation or compare against established morphological databases\n  - Develop inter-channel spatial relationship metrics to quantitatively assess biological consistency beyond visual inspection",

The authors present a thorough methodology and demonstrate the framework's ability to generate high-resolution, biologically realistic 3D cell structures, which could accelerate pre-clinical drug development. The manuscript is well-written and presents a clear rationale for the proposed approach.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The proposed method is innovative in its use of vector quantization and diffusion models to handle multichannel 3D data. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed discussion of how BYOC differentiates itself from existing generative models in the domain of 3D biological data synthesis. There are several recent works on diffusion models for 3D data, and a clearer delineation of the unique contributions of BYOC would strengthen the manuscript.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted on a single dataset of metastatic melanoma cells treated with three different drugs. While this provides a solid foundation, the validation could be strengthened by including additional datasets and cell types to demonstrate the generalizability of the method. Moreover, a comparison with more recent state-of-the-art methods would provide a clearer picture of the method's performance relative to the latest advancements.\n\n3. Comparisons: The quantitative evaluation includes several baseline models, but the inclusion of more recent diffusion-based models would provide a more comprehensive comparison. Additionally, while the qualitative evaluation shows promising results, a more rigorous statistical analysis (e.g., significance tests) would help substantiate the claims of superiority over existing methods.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors state that the code will be released, but the current manuscript lacks sufficient detail regarding the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters. Providing a more detailed description of these aspects is crucial for ensuring that the results can be independently reproduced.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Some figures are cluttered and could benefit from a more organized presentation. For instance, Figure 4 could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions.\n   \n2. Notation: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is sometimes inconsistent and lacks sufficient explanation. Clarifying these points would enhance the readability of the manuscript.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms are used without definition, such as \"R=4\". Providing definitions for these acronyms would aid readers who are unfamiliar with the terminology.\n\n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors exist throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7).

Additionally, while the reproducibility statement is positive, the manuscript lacks sufficient methodological detail to ensure independent reproduction. Overall, the manuscript has the potential to make a substantial contribution to the field, but it requires further refinement in terms of validation and reproducibility.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision.

On a dataset of ∼7k melanoma cells under three drug treatments, BYOC qualitatively outperforms a 3D diffusion baseline and achieves better FID/MMD scores; ablations suggest per‑channel codebooks improve fidelity over a single shared codebook.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationIntroduces a “library of codebooks” with per‑channel vector quantization for multichannel 3D volumes and a joint diffusion process that conditions the reverse step for each channel on the other channel’s latent.A practical dual‑channel 3D U‑Net backbone with spatial/depthwise attention to capture inter‑ and intra‑channel dependencies in volumes.Sensible engineering choices (latent-space diffusion, freezing the autoencoder, normalization of latents) that make 3D multichannel synthesis feasible on moderate hardware.\n- Experimental rigor and validationBaseline comparisons include both adversarial and diffusion families (HA‑GAN, W‑GAN, α‑GAN, MedicalDiffusion).Ablation on codebook designs (unimodal vs separate per channel; normalization strategies) and reporting across three drug conditions.Implementation details and hyperparameters are provided, which supports reproducibility.\n- Clarity of presentationThe high-level pipeline and motivation are clearly explained; diagrams effectively convey the two-stage setup and joint diffusion idea.The qualitative figures credibly show improved boundary sharpness and nucleus–cell spatial consistency over a strong 3D diffusion baseline.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses an important gap: synthesizing coherent multichannel 3D cellular structures, a prerequisite for in silico phenotypic screening.Potential impact for pre-clinical experimentation, enabling data augmentation and hypothesis generation about morphology–treatment relationships.\n\n- Introduces a “library of codebooks” with per‑channel vector quantization for multichannel 3D volumes and a joint diffusion process that conditions the reverse step for each channel on the other channel’s latent.\n- A practical dual‑channel 3D U‑Net backbone with spatial/depthwise attention to capture inter‑ and intra‑channel dependencies in volumes.\n- Sensible engineering choices (latent-space diffusion, freezing the autoencoder, normalization of latents) that make 3D multichannel synthesis feasible on moderate hardware.\n\n- Baseline comparisons include both adversarial and diffusion families (HA‑GAN, W‑GAN, α‑GAN, MedicalDiffusion).\n- Ablation on codebook designs (unimodal vs separate per channel; normalization strategies) and reporting across three drug conditions.\n- Implementation details and hyperparameters are provided, which supports reproducibility.\n\n- The high-level pipeline and motivation are clearly explained; diagrams effectively convey the two-stage setup and joint diffusion idea.\n- The qualitative figures credibly show improved boundary sharpness and nucleus–cell spatial consistency over a strong 3D diffusion baseline.\n\n- Addresses an important gap: synthesizing coherent multichannel 3D cellular structures, a prerequisite for in silico phenotypic screening.\n- Potential impact for pre-clinical experimentation, enabling data augmentation and hypothesis generation about morphology–treatment relationships.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe “first 3D fluorescence cell generative model” claim is too strong; prior works have synthesized 3D fluorescence microscopy volumes or used generative pipelines for 3D cell imagery, albeit with different conditioning setups or modality focus.The diffusion objective is under-specified (noise vs x0 prediction, variance parameterization); Eq.

Could leakage occur?\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentMetrics: Using Med3D features and channel averaging to compute FID/MMD weakens conclusions about the main contribution (inter‑channel fidelity). Consider:Computing FID on concatenated channels or learning a multi-channel 3D feature extractor on the microscopy domain (self-supervised or supervised on this dataset).Adding biological/structural metrics: nucleus-inside-cell violation rate; overlap ratios; centroid distances; nucleus-to-cell volume ratio distribution; sphericity/elongation; filamentous protrusion statistics; treatment-specific morphometrics and distribution shift tests.Reporting MS‑SSIM or LPIPS in 3D to assess diversity vs overfitting.Protocol: Clarify whether baselines were trained per drug, and ensure consistent capacity and training budget. Resolve the discrepancy between 80/20 and 5-fold CV; if 5-fold was used, describe model selection and the number of real samples used for FID per fold.Generalization: Training per drug restricts controllability. A stronger claim would train a single conditional model (drug label as condition) and show interpolation/extrapolation between treatments.Efficiency: Provide sampling speed and memory profiles for all baselines at 64^3, and discuss feasibility of scaling to higher resolutions.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)3D medical diffusion: Methods like wavelet-domain diffusion (memory-efficient, 3D volumes) and cascaded amortized latent diffusion for large volumes demonstrate strong 3D fidelity and efficiency; situating BYOC against these approaches would clarify trade-offs (e.g., your joint multichannel modeling vs their scaling).Conditional 2D/3D medical generative work (e.g., multitask/multi‑stain diffusion) shows that jointly modeling related channels or tasks improves fidelity; BYOC aligns with this insight but should adopt stronger quantitative evidence for inter‑channel gains.3D microscopy synthesis: Prior pipelines generate 3D fluorescence data from masks or via cascaded multi‑view reconstruction; while BYOC directly synthesizes multichannel 3D volumes, referencing these would contextualize novelty and motivate future conditional controls (e.g., mask‑guided generation).Multichannel quantization: Prior “multichannel quantization” and large codebook strategies highlight alternatives to improve latent richness; discussing why per‑channel codebooks were preferred (and how codebook size/utilization affects BYOC) would strengthen the positioning.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe target application—rapid in silico exploration of treatment-induced morphology—is compelling.

If per-drug, why was conditional training not attempted, and how do you envision scaling to more treatments?\n- How exactly is the diffusion loss formulated (ε‑prediction vs x0‑prediction vs v‑prediction) and with what loss (L1/L2)? How is the reverse variance handled (fixed vs learned)?\n- Are the codebook normalization statistics (min/max) computed on training data only? Are they per-channel and per-drug, or global?\n- For FID/MMD, what is the exact real set used: validation or test split per fold? How many real samples were used per fold, and were 5,000 generated samples matched by an equal number of real samples?\n- Why average the two channels before computing FID/MMD? Have you tried computing FID on concatenated channels or using a microscopy-domain 3D feature extractor?\n- Can you report quantitative biology-aware metrics (nucleus-in-cell violation rate, volume ratios, shape descriptors) per drug, and whether BYOC narrows the gap to real distributions vs baselines?\n- How were baselines adapted to be multichannel? Did they receive exactly two channels at input/output with comparable capacity and training time, and were they also trained per-drug?\n- What is the codebook size per channel actually used (Appendix says 1024); what is utilization, and how sensitive are results to codebook size and latent dimensionality?\n- In the ablation, what precisely do “Absolute,” “Cell,” and “Nucleus” normalization variants mean operationally? In some cases “Nucleus” outperforms BYOC—can you explain why and whether this reflects dataset bias?\n- Can you quantify sampling speed and memory usage across methods, and discuss scaling to higher resolutions (e.g., 128^3 or beyond)?\n- Do you enforce any constraints to prevent the nucleus from leaving the cell boundary? If not, how often does it occur, and can BYOC’s joint diffusion be augmented with geometric constraints?\n- Will the data preprocessing scripts and trained models be released with the anonymized code? Are there plans to evaluate on other cell lines or multiorganelle channels?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nBYOC is a well-motivated and practically designed framework for multichannel 3D cellular synthesis that combines per-channel quantization with joint latent diffusion. The qualitative improvements are convincing, and the ablation suggests the per‑channel codebook idea is useful. However, the evaluation protocol does not yet support the strongest claims: channel-averaged FID on MR/CT features cannot verify inter-channel consistency, the model appears to be trained per drug (limiting generality and controllability), and biologically meaningful quantitative validation is missing. The methodological description has a few notational and specification gaps that should be clarified. I see solid potential and relevance for the bioimaging community; with stronger, biology-aware metrics, a conditional model across treatments, clearer baselines, and tighter methodological details, this work could be competitive at a top-tier venue. As it stands, it is a promising contribution that would benefit from substantial strengthening of the experimental evidence and positioning relative to recent 3D diffusion literature.",

Equations (12)–(13) contain typographical inaccuracies and omit essential details.  \n2. **Generality and experimental design** – Training a separate model per drug condition undermines the claim of a unified generator and limits controllability. A single conditional model with drug labels could better demonstrate coherence across treatments.  \n3. **Evaluation metrics** – FID/MMD are computed on channel‑averaged volumes using Med3D features trained on MR/CT data, which do not capture fluorescence‑specific or inter‑channel structure. This weakens evidence for improvements in cross‑channel consistency.  \n4. **Lack of biological validation** – The study omits biologically meaningful quantitative metrics (e.g., nucleus‑inside‑cell integrity, volume ratios, shape descriptors) and expert evaluation, despite their importance for the stated downstream applications.  \n5. **Reproducibility and clarity** – Inconsistencies between “80/20 split” and “5‑fold cross‑validation,” unclear baseline configurations, and minor notational errors in Section 3 hinder reproducibility. Latent normalization and codebook statistics require clarification regarding computation scope (per‑drug or global).  \n6. **Related work** – The discussion misses connections to recent scalable and memory‑efficient 3D diffusion methods (e.g., wavelet‑domain or cascaded latent models) and to microscopy‑specific generative and multichannel quantization literature.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Section 3.1 contains symbol and dimensional typos, duplicated latent variable references, and missing definitions (e.g., variance schedule).  \n- Figures are informative, but minor rendering artifacts are visible.  \n- The ablation table includes partly garbled terms (“Absolute,” “Cell,” “Nucleus” normalization) that require clearer definitions.  \n- Please report sampling efficiency, memory usage, and codebook utilization.  \n- Clarify release plans for data preprocessing scripts and model weights.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, BYOC offers a technically sound and innovative approach to multichannel 3D cellular image synthesis, introducing a useful per‑channel quantization and joint diffusion design. Its strengths lie in conceptual novelty, clear engineering, and potential significance for microscope data augmentation. However, the work’s central claims are weakened by incomplete diffusion specification, limited generalization across treatments, and evaluation metrics that do not directly assess inter‑channel or biological fidelity. Strengthening these aspects and expanding comparison to recent 3D diffusion research would make this contribution more compelling and verifiable.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The study is promising and well‑motivated but requires substantial clarification of the methodology, improved biologically relevant evaluation, and expanded comparative analysis before it can be considered for acceptance.",

        "text": "# Review Report for IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThe paper addresses the critical challenge of generating biologically realistic 3D cellular structures from multichannel fluorescence microscopy data, where maintaining phenotypic consistency between cell and nucleus channels while capturing drug-induced morphological changes remains difficult. The authors propose BYOC (Build Your Own Cell), a novel framework that combines vector quantization with diffusion modeling to synthesize 3D cell structures. The approach features a \"library of codebooks\" to independently process cell and nucleus channels while learning their interdependencies, followed by a multichannel diffusion model that preserves spatial relationships. Evaluated on 7,083 melanoma cells treated with three different drugs (Nocodazole, Binimetinib, and Blebbistatin), BYOC demonstrates superior performance over existing methods with significantly lower FID scores (1.91 vs. 2.12 for Nocodazole) and MMD metrics (8.34 vs. 9.55). The qualitative results show BYOC generates samples with better-preserved cell and nucleus boundaries and more realistic morphological characteristics, enabling high-throughput in silico screening of drug effects on cell morphology.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The \"library of codebooks\" approach is innovative and effectively addresses the critical challenge of maintaining inter-channel consistency while processing biologically distinct but related features\n- The multichannel diffusion framework successfully preserves spatial relationships between cell and nucleus, which is essential for biological validity\n- The comprehensive evaluation across three different drug treatments with both quantitative metrics (FID, MMD) and qualitative visual assessment provides strong evidence of superiority over existing methods\n- The ablation study clearly demonstrates the importance of channel-specific codebooks compared to unimodal representations\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The framework is currently limited to only two channels (cell and nucleus), which restricts applicability to more complex multichannel datasets with additional organelles or cellular compartments\n- The evaluation is restricted to melanoma cells treated with just three drugs, limiting generalizability to other cell types, conditions, or more complex drug combinations\n- The paper lacks discussion about potential biases in the synthetic data generation process that might affect downstream biological analyses\n- Computational requirements (4 GPUs with 24GB RAM) are substantial and could limit accessibility for researchers with limited resources\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The visualizations (particularly Figures 4, 5, and 6) are clear and effectively demonstrate the method's capabilities and advantages\n- The framework is well-motivated with appropriate background on the biological significance of cell morphology in drug response\n- The training details and hyperparameters are thoroughly documented in the appendix, enhancing reproducibility\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Some high-resolution sample figures could benefit from more detailed annotations to highlight specific morphological features\n- The clinical relevance of the specific drug treatments could be better explained to strengthen the connection to real-world applications\n- The comparison with MedicalDiffusion lacks metrics on inference speed despite noting differences in generation time (~7s vs ~5s)\n- The limitation section could be expanded with more specific implementation strategies for future multi-channel extensions\n\n## 3. Summary Evaluation\n\n**Significance:** The work addresses a significant challenge in medical imaging and drug discovery by enabling high-throughput in silico screening of drug effects on 3D cellular morphology. The ability to generate biologically realistic cell structures with preserved inter-channel relationships has strong potential to reduce reliance on labor-intensive experimental studies, accelerating preclinical drug development pipelines. The focus on phenotypic consistency between cell and nucleus channels is particularly valuable for accurate biological interpretation.\n\n**Innovation:** The paper presents a novel approach through its \"library of codebooks\" concept that processes biological channels independently while learning their interdependencies. The extension of diffusion models to multichannel 3D cellular synthesis with channel-specific processing represents a meaningful advancement beyond existing 3D generation methods. The combination of vector quantization with diffusion modeling for this specific application is well-conceived and effectively executed.\n\n**Evaluation:** The evaluation is comprehensive, including both quantitative metrics (FID and MMD) across multiple drug treatments and thorough qualitative visual assessment. The comparison with multiple baselines (GAN-based methods and MedicalDiffusion) provides strong evidence of the method's superiority. The ablation study effectively demonstrates the importance of channel-specific codebooks. However, the evaluation could be strengthened with more diverse cell types and additional metrics related to biological validity beyond structural similarity.\n\n**Reproducibility:** The paper provides excellent documentation of implementation details, including thorough hyperparameters in the appendix, training procedures, and evaluation protocols. The authors mention their project repository (currently anonymous) and provide detailed descriptions of the experimental setup. The use of standard metrics and publicly available architectures (Med3D for feature extraction) enhances reproducibility. The comprehensive appendix with training parameters is particularly helpful for replication.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\nMinor Revision\n\nThe paper presents a novel and well-executed approach to 3D cellular image generation with clear improvements over existing methods. The technical contribution is significant, the evaluation is thorough, and the work has potential impact on both medical imaging and drug discovery communities. While there are some limitations regarding generalizability to more complex datasets, these are appropriately acknowledged by the authors and do not substantially undermine the value of the current contribution.\n\nI recommend minor revision to:\n1) Expand the discussion about potential biases in synthetic data that might affect downstream analyses\n2) Provide more context on the clinical relevance of the specific drug treatments used\n3) Include inference speed metrics in the comparison with MedicalDiffusion\n4) Add more specific implementation strategies for future multi-channel extensions\n\nThese revisions would strengthen the paper without requiring additional experiments, and the core contribution is solid and well-prepared for publication in TMI after these modifications.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the generation of realistic synthetic 3‑D fluorescence microscopy volumes that reflect drug‑induced morphological changes. Using a collection of 7 083 metastatic melanoma cells imaged by light‑sheet microscopy (two fluorescence channels: cytoplasm and nucleus) and annotated with three pharmacological conditions (Nocodazole, Binimetinib, Blebbistatin), the authors build a pipeline that first learns separate vector‑quantised (VQ) codebooks for each channel and then feeds the resulting latent tensors into a dual‑channel diffusion model (DualChannelUNet) that denoises them jointly. Performance is assessed with Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), where the proposed method attains lower scores than several baseline generators; visual inspection is reported to show faithful reconstruction of inter‑channel structure. The primary claim is the introduction of the first multichannel 3‑D fluorescence cell generator that couples independent channel codebooks with a joint diffusion process, purportedly preserving biologically relevant relationships.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Relevance.** Producing multichannel 3‑D microscopy data is indeed a pressing need for virtual screening and augmentation of scarce biological datasets. Emphasising preservation of the nucleus‑to‑cell geometry is a worthwhile objective.  \n- **Originality.** Merging per‑channel VQ codebooks with a shared diffusion backbone (DualChannelUNet) represents a novel twist on recent multimodal diffusion frameworks such as MM‑Diffusion. Nevertheless, the manuscript does not sufficiently differentiate its approach from existing VQ‑GAN‑diffusion pipelines, and key architectural details—e.g., where attention modules are placed, depth of the UNet, and how the two channels are fused—are barely described.  \n- **Empirical validation.** The reported reductions in FID and MMD are encouraging, yet the evaluation is confined to these two aggregate metrics. No statistical testing (e.g., confidence intervals, hypothesis tests) is presented, and the study lacks measures that specifically target inter‑channel consistency (for instance, the ratio of nucleus volume to whole‑cell volume). Moreover, the impact of the synthetic data on downstream tasks (e.g., training a classifier for drug response) is absent.  \n- **Reproducibility.** While hyper‑parameters are tabulated (Tables 2‑3) and a anonymised repository is cited, the underlying dataset is undisclosed, preprocessing steps (anisotropy correction, intensity scaling) are insufficiently explained, and the adaptation of baseline methods to a two‑channel setting is vaguely mentioned. Training curves, random seeds, and details of computational resources are omitted, which hampers independent verification.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n1. **Voxel geometry.** Section 4.1 does not report the voxel size, physical scaling, or any anisotropy present in the volumetric data, making it impossible to assess the realism of the generated samples.  \n2. **Dataset scope.** The work is limited to a single cell line (melanoma) and three drug perturbations. Generalisation to other cell types, tissues, or broader perturbation libraries remains untested, and the data are not made publicly available.  \n3. **Baseline adaptation.** The claim that baseline generators were “adjusted to process multichannel inputs” lacks concrete description of the architectural changes, loss modifications, or hyper‑parameter retuning, raising doubts about the fairness of the comparative results.  \n4. **Feature embedding choice.** Quantitative metrics rely on embeddings from Med3D networks pre‑trained on unrelated medical imaging modalities. The manuscript provides no evidence that these embeddings capture the relevant cellular morphology or inter‑channel relationships needed for a fair assessment.  \n5. **Statistical reporting.** Table 1 lists mean FID/MMD values obtained through five‑fold cross‑validation but omits confidence intervals or any statistical significance testing; the observed differences could be due to random variation.  \n6. **Ablation scope.** Figure 6 examines only variations in codebook configuration. Other critical design choices—such as the number of diffusion timesteps, latent dimensionality, or inclusion of attention layers—are not explored, leaving the contribution of each component ambiguous.  \n7. **Inter‑channel consistency analysis.** Beyond qualitative visual examples, there is no quantitative examination of whether synthetic nuclei occupy appropriate sub‑volumes within the generated cells (e.g., correlation of nucleus‑to‑cell volume ratios).  \n8. **Computational demand.** No information is given on training time, inference latency, or memory consumption for the high‑resolution 3‑D diffusion pipeline, making it difficult to judge scalability to larger datasets or higher resolutions.  \n9. **Code availability.** The provided repository link is a placeholder (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/XXX) and the associated code/license are missing, preventing replication of the experiments.  \n10. **Presentation issues.** The manuscript contains numerous typographical and formatting errors (misplaced symbols, missing section headings) that obstruct readability and may conceal important methodological details.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision**  \n\nThe study introduces a promising direction for multichannel 3‑D microscopy synthesis, but substantial concerns remain regarding methodological transparency, evaluation rigor, and reproducibility. Addressing the points above—particularly by providing detailed architectural descriptions, robust statistical analyses, quantitative inter‑channel consistency measures, and a publicly accessible dataset/codebase—will be essential before the manuscript can be considered for publication.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript addresses the synthesis of realistic 3‑D fluorescence microscopy volumes that reproduce drug‑induced morphological alterations in metastatic melanoma cells. It employs a dataset of more than 7 000 light‑sheet microscopy volumes across two fluorescence channels (cytoplasm and nucleus) and three pharmacological conditions. The proposed pipeline learns separate vector‑quantised codebooks per channel, followed by a dual‑channel diffusion model (DualChannelUNet) that jointly denoises the latent representations. Performance is evaluated with Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), showing improvements over baseline generators. The submission claims to be the first multichannel 3‑D fluorescence generator coupling independent channel encodings within a unified diffusion process. The paper is relevant and potentially useful but requires major improvements in methodological transparency, validation rigor, and reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and architectural clarity:** The combination of separate VQ codebooks and a joint diffusion backbone is creative but insufficiently distinguished from prior VQ‑GAN‑diffusion approaches. Key architectural details—attention placement, UNet depth, and channel fusion strategy—are not described.  \n2. **Experimental rigor:** Evaluation relies solely on global FID and MMD metrics without statistical tests, confidence intervals, or significance analysis. There are no quantitative measures of inter‑channel consistency, such as nucleus‑to‑cell volume ratios.  \n3. **Validation scope:** The study is limited to a single melanoma line under three drugs, with no examination of generalization to other cell types or perturbations.  \n4. **Baseline fairness:** Adjustments made to baseline models for multichannel input are insufficiently documented, raising concerns over comparison validity.  \n5. **Feature embeddings:** FID/MMD are computed using Med3D embeddings trained on unrelated modalities; their suitability for cellular morphology assessment is unsubstantiated.  \n6. **Ablation completeness:** Only codebook variants were tested; other critical parameters (diffusion steps, latent size, attention) were not explored.  \n7. **Reproducibility:** Dataset access, preprocessing procedures, training conditions, and computational specifications are incompletely reported.

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists’ eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial dynamics of their gaze. The video, featuring a red gaze point overlaid on CXR images, emphasizes regions of focused attention during interpretation. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with a video input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance improves by up to 25.4% on Impression generation task and on average 7.9% for all tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Our approach enhanced open-domain LVLM models, when combined with exemplar reports for in-context learning, outperform medical models as well as those specifically trained for CXR report generation on the benchmark dataset. This work highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case), when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks, pointing out a new effective approach of utilising LVLMs in healthcare and beyond.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis article introduces a novel prompting method called RadEyeVideo, which presents radiologists’ eye-tracking data as a video sequence to capture the temporal and spatial order of their gaze (i.e., scan paths). The authors evaluated the effectiveness of this approach in chest X-ray report generation and disease diagnosis tasks using large vision-language models (LVLMs) with video input capabilities. Results show that incorporating eye-gaze video prompts improved model performance by 25.4% on the Impression generation task, with an average performance increase of 7.9% across all tasks.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The RadEyeVideo method converts radiologists’ eye-tracking data into video sequences for use in chest X-ray report generation and diagnostic tasks, significantly enhancing the performance of general large vision-language models (LVLMs). Experimental results indicate a 25.4% improvement in the Impression generation task and an average improvement of 7.9% across all tasks, outperforming models specifically designed for medical applications.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation of Eye-Tracking Prompting Methods: This study presents the first thorough evaluation of various eye-tracking integration techniques, including static heatmaps, eye-tracking text prompts, and dynamic video prompts. The results indicate that RadEyeVideo outperforms the other methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance, establishing a new standard for eye-tracking data prompts.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Methodological Clarity: a) The paper lacks sufficient detail about the video prompt integration process, particularly how the video information is encoded and processed by the LVLMs. The technical implementation of combining video sequences with textual prompts could be more thoroughly explained. b) There's limited discussion of potential alternatives to full video sequence processing that might achieve similar results with lower computational costs.\n\n- Data Collection and Generalizability Limitations: a) The methodology requires synchronized eye-tracking data collection during radiologist readings, which is resource-intensive and difficult to scale. b) The approach may not generalize well to scenarios where real-time eye-tracking data is unavailable or impractical to collect. c) The current evaluation is limited to a relatively small dataset (2,298 CXR images), raising questions about broader applicability.\n\n- Computational Efficiency Concerns: The direct use of complete eye-tracking video sequences as prompts likely increases computational overhead significantly. While the authors mention sampling k frames (typically 16) from the total sequence, there's limited analysis of the computational trade-offs or optimal sampling strategies. The method may be computationally prohibitive for real-time clinical applications.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease address the concern raised in weakness part.\nMoreover, there are some questions may help you to address the weakness.\n1) What is the computational overhead of processing video prompts compared to traditional image-only or text-only prompts?\n2) Have you explored more efficient alternatives to using complete video sequences, such as key frame selection or compressed representations? 3) How do you envision this approach being implemented in real-world clinical settings where real-time eye-tracking data may not be available? 4) Have you considered alternative methods for generating synthetic eye-tracking data that could make the approach more broadly applicable? 5)\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 5",

Specifically, the mechanisms combining video sequences with textual prompts should be specified more clearly. Additionally, alternative, lower-cost representations approximating full sequence processing are not discussed.  \n2. **Data Collection and Generalizability** – The framework relies on synchronized eye-tracking during radiologist readings, making data acquisition resource-intensive and potentially limiting scalability. Its applicability to datasets or clinical environments lacking real-time gaze recordings remains uncertain. Furthermore, the evaluation relies on a relatively small sample (2,298 chest X-ray images), which restricts evidence for generalization.  \n3. **Computational Efficiency** – Employing full eye-tracking videos likely imposes significant computational demands.

Red fixation points are superimposed on CXR images to highlight the areas that doctors pay attention to, so as to dynamically present the doctor's eye movement path. Improve the ability of radiologists or AI models to diagnose chest diseases by providing rich contextual information.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed method, RadEyeVideo, combines video, text, and eye movement data to realize the fusion of multi-modal information and improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis.\n2. The authors conducted a thorough assessment of various eye-tracking integration techniques, providing strong empirical support for their claims.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. In Figure 2, the authors illustrate different prompting methods; however, the figure does not clearly distinguish between the use of text descriptions and video inputs. This ambiguity makes it challenging to understand whether the authors used text descriptions to guide the prompt along with the video input or if they only provided video data. \n2. The author's experiments conducted on only one dataset are clearly insufficient in terms of persuasiveness. This limitation may affect the generalizability and applicability of the research findings. To enhance the credibility of the study, it is recommended that the authors validate their approach on different datasets.\n3. When the authors use radiologist's eye-tracking sequences as video input, this approach does enhance the model's understanding of prior knowledge in the diagnostic reading process to a certain extent. However, converting eye-tracking data into video format substantially increases the number of tokens, leading to significant computational resource consumption and longer inference times for the model.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. The RadEyeVideo method integrates the eye movement data of the radiologist as a video sequence to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of his gaze. However, the article does not explain in detail how this video sequence is specifically generated, for example, how the eye movement data is sampled and converted into video frames, and how these frames contain temporal and spatial information.\n2. In Section 2.3 INPUT REPRESENTATION, to fit the input requirements of LVLM, the authors uniformly sampled the video sequence and selected 16 frames as inputs. However, the article does not explain why 16 frames were chosen and whether this choice had a significant impact on model performance. In addition, whether the impact of using more or fewer frames on model performance has been explored is also a question worth exploring. This helps to further understand the effect of video data length and quality on model performance.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

It is unclear whether text is used alongside video or if only video serves as the input.

Validation on multiple datasets is strongly recommended to strengthen the study’s applicability and credibility.  \n3. **Computational Overhead** – Transforming eye-tracking data into video format substantially increases the number of input tokens, resulting in heavy computational cost and slower inference. The trade-off between performance gain and computational efficiency should be analyzed.  \n4. **Methodological Details** – The paper does not describe how raw eye-tracking data are sampled and converted into video frames to preserve temporal and spatial information.

The work sits at the interface of computer vision, multimodal machine learning, and medical imaging.  It proposes a new data representation (eye‑gaze videos) and evaluates several multimodal prompting strategies.  \n✅ **Within scope** of *IEEE TMI*: it proposes a methodological innovation for human‑in‑the‑loop medical image analysis with structured experiments on image–language models.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe primary novelty lies in encoding gaze fixation sequences as *video prompts* to capture temporal order, contrasting with prior static heatmaps or textual cues. While use of eye‑tracking data for medical imaging AI is known, extending it to video‑based prompts for LVLMs is a distinctive but *incremental* conceptual step rather than a fundamental algorithmic advance. The contribution is therefore methodological at the data‑representation and prompting‑design level, not at the level of new model architectures or learning theory.  \nOverall novelty: **moderate**—potentially interesting for the community if empirical gains are validated more rigorously.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \n- **Dataset**: built from MIMIC‑Eye (≈2.3 k images). The authors acknowledge limited sample size and potential train/test overlap; nonetheless, methodology to mitigate bias is described (alpha/beta splits).  \n- **Baselines**: several state‑of‑the‑art LVLMs, including medical and general‑domain ones, are compared.  \n- **Metrics**: both lexical (ROUGE, BERTScore) and radiology‑specific (CheXbert, RadGraph, RaTEScore) used with a scaled‑score composite.  \n- **Ablation**: frame‑count, gaze filtering, and in‑context learning were examined.  \n- **Weaknesses**: limited statistical analysis—no confidence intervals or significance testing; clinical relevance of improvements not formally studied; dataset imbalance remains; ethical statement minimal. Reproducibility seems adequate (code indicated).  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nManuscript is generally well organized, with clear figures, equations, and tables. Wording is occasionally verbose; minor grammatical inconsistencies appear but readability is high. Quantitative results are exhaustive, perhaps excessively so for main text.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nData use complies with MIMIC‑Eye licensing; anonymization stated.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces RadEyeVideo, a novel approach that integrates radiologists' eye-tracking data as video sequences to enhance large vision-language models (LVLMs) for chest X-ray analysis. Unlike existing methods that use static heatmaps or textual prompts, RadEyeVideo captures both spatial and temporal dynamics of radiologists' gaze patterns by creating videos with red dots overlaid on CXR images, where dot duration reflects fixation time (Section 2.2, Equations 1-3). The authors evaluate three general-domain video-capable LVLMs (LongVA, VideoLLaMA2, LLaVA-OneVision) on report generation and diagnosis tasks using the MIMIC-Eye dataset (2,298 CXR images with eye-gaze annotations). Results show RadEyeVideo achieves up to 25.4% improvement on Impression generation and 7.9% average improvement across all tasks compared to baseline methods (Table 3). The enhanced general-domain models outperform specialized medical LVLMs like CheXagent and CXR-LLaVA on benchmark datasets.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Limited Dataset Scale and Generalizability**: The evaluation relies on a small dataset of only 2,298 images from MIMIC-Eye, with the beta split containing merely 92 images for robust evaluation (Table 1, Page 6). This severely limits statistical power and generalizability claims. The authors acknowledge this limitation (Page 10) but proceed with evaluation on both training and test splits, potentially introducing data contamination issues that could inflate reported performance gains.\n\n• **Inconsistent Mathematical Formulation and Implementation Details**: The video construction methodology lacks precision in several key aspects. Equation 2 defines frame rate as 10 fps but provides conflicting information about total frame calculation (Fi = ti × fps vs Fi = ti × 10). The uniform sampling strategy in Equation 3 uses floor division that could lead to frame loss, and the fixed 5-pixel gaze radius lacks justification or sensitivity analysis. The filtering criterion using average fixation duration (Equation 1) appears arbitrary without empirical validation.\n\n• **Weak Experimental Design and Evaluation Methodology**: The scaled evaluation metric based on CheXagent performance (Equation 7) creates circular reasoning since CheXagent is simultaneously used as both a baseline competitor and the normalization reference. The evaluation lacks statistical significance testing despite small sample sizes, and the temperature parameter of 0 eliminates randomness assessment. The choice of 16 frames appears arbitrary, supported only by a limited ablation study (Figure 4) without theoretical justification.\n\n• **Insufficient Baseline Comparisons and Analysis**: The paper compares against limited eye-gaze integration methods and lacks comparison with recent human-AI collaboration approaches in medical imaging. The heatmap implementation details are poorly described (Page 7), making reproduction difficult. Performance improvements show high variance across models and tasks (Table 3), with VideoLLaMA2 showing negligible improvement (0.6%) and inconsistent patterns that undermine the claimed superiority of the video approach.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Expand Dataset Scale and Validation Strategy**: Conduct evaluation on larger, more diverse datasets beyond MIMIC-Eye to establish generalizability. Implement proper cross-validation with completely held-out test sets to avoid contamination issues. Include multi-institutional validation data to demonstrate robustness across different radiologist populations and imaging protocols.\n\n• **Clarify and Validate Mathematical Formulations**: Provide consistent and precise mathematical notation throughout, particularly for frame rate calculations and sampling strategies. Conduct sensitivity analysis for key hyperparameters including gaze radius size, filtering thresholds, and frame numbers. Justify the average-duration filtering criterion through empirical analysis of gaze pattern significance and provide theoretical foundation for uniform sampling approach.\n\n• **Strengthen Experimental Design with Rigorous Statistics**: Replace the circular CheXagent-based scaling metric with independent evaluation standards or multiple reference points. Include statistical significance testing with confidence intervals and effect size calculations. Implement multiple temperature settings to assess model reliability and add cross-model validation to strengthen claims about video-based prompting superiority.\n\n• **Comprehensive Baseline Analysis and Methodological Transparency**: Include comparisons with recent human-AI collaboration methods in medical imaging and provide detailed implementation specifications for all baseline approaches. Conduct thorough ablation studies examining individual components of the video creation pipeline and provide qualitative analysis of failure cases to better understand method limitations and boundary conditions.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript presents RadEyeVideo, a novel approach that integrates radiologists' eye-gaze data as video sequences to enhance the performance of general-domain Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. The authors argue that capturing the sequential and temporal dynamics of eye movements can provide deeper insights into radiologists' decision-making processes, thereby improving the accuracy and clinical relevance of CXR report generation and diagnosis. The manuscript includes a comprehensive evaluation of RadEyeVideo against existing methods, demonstrating significant performance gains across various metrics.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While RadEyeVideo introduces a compelling method for integrating eye-gaze data into LVLMs, the manuscript could benefit from a clearer distinction from existing work on multimodal human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems. The authors should provide a more detailed discussion of how their approach compares to and builds upon recent advancements in this area.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily conducted on the MIMIC-Eye dataset, which, while valuable, may not fully capture the diversity of real-world CXR interpretations. Including a broader range of datasets or validation on prospective CXR data could strengthen the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the evaluation metrics could be expanded to include qualitative assessments by radiologists to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's clinical utility.\n\n3. Comparison Baselines: The manuscript includes a thorough comparison with various prompting methods, including heatmaps and fixation text. However, the inclusion of a broader range of state-of-the-art LVLMs specifically trained for CXR analysis would provide a more robust benchmark for assessing RadEyeVideo's performance improvements.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors state that the code will be made available, which is commendable. However, the manuscript would benefit from a more detailed description of the experimental setup, including the preprocessing pipeline, model training parameters, and specific configurations used for the various LVLMs. This would facilitate independent replication and further development of the method.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figure Quality: Figures 3 and 5 could be improved by providing a clearer comparison between different prompting methods. Zooming in on specific regions of interest and providing more detailed annotations would enhance readability.\n\n2. Notational Consistency: The manuscript occasionally uses inconsistent notation, particularly in describing the eye-gaze data processing steps. Clarifying these definitions and ensuring consistent usage throughout the document would improve clarity.\n\n3. Acronym Definitions: Some acronyms, such as \"RADEYEVIDEO,\" are introduced without full definitions. Providing a glossary or defining these terms at their first appearance would aid reader comprehension.\n\n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors, such as \"CXRMate\" (p. 11) and \"CXRMate does not support textual prompts for in-context learning, so its vanilla performance is reported instead\" (p. 12), should be corrected for consistency.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: enhancing the performance of general-domain LVLMs in CXR analysis through the integration of radiologists' eye-gaze data. The proposed RadEyeVideo method introduces a novel and innovative approach by capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics of eye movements. The evaluation demonstrates substantial performance improvements across multiple metrics, suggesting the method's potential to bridge the gap between general-purpose and task-specific models. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by incorporating a broader range of datasets and validation scenarios. The reproducibility of the approach is addressed through the provision of code, but more detailed methodological descriptions are needed to ensure independent replication. Overall, the manuscript makes a valuable contribution to the field of AI-assisted diagnostics, though further refinement in evaluation and reproducibility is recommended.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the evaluation to include a broader range of datasets and validation scenarios, clarify comparisons with existing work, and provide more detailed methodological descriptions to enhance reproducibility.",

        "text": "## RadEyeVideo: Enhancing GENERAL-DOMAIN LARGE VISION LANGUAGE MODEL FOR CHEST X-RAY ANALYSIS WITH VIDEO REPRESENTATIONS OF EYE GAZE\n\n### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes RadEyeVideo, a prompting strategy that converts radiologists’ fixation traces into short videos (moving red dot over the CXR) to provide both spatial and temporal gaze information to general-domain video-capable LVLMs. Evaluated on MIMIC-Eye for findings generation, impression summarization, and differential diagnosis, the method shows consistent gains over “no gaze” baselines and often outperforms heatmap and textual-gaze prompts, with the largest improvements observed on impression summarization. The authors also provide code to recreate gaze videos (“MIMIC-Eye-Video”) and ablations on frames, fixation filtering, and in-context exemplars.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationUsing video representations of expert gaze as a visual prompt for LVLMs is a simple, elegant idea that preserves scanpath order and duration, going beyond prior heatmap and text encodings.The approach leverages existing video interfaces of general-domain LVLMs without fine-tuning, offering a practical, lightweight pathway to incorporate human expertise.\n- Experimental rigor and validationThe work compares three gaze encodings (heatmap, text, video) across multiple video-capable LVLMs and includes medical LVLM baselines, offering a broad perspective.Ablations on frame count, fixation filtering, and in-context learning provide initial insight into design choices and their effects.\n- Clarity of presentationThe motivation for preserving temporal order is clearly articulated; the video construction pipeline is easy to reproduce.Prompts and experimental settings are described with reasonable detail; code availability for dataset reconstruction is useful for reproducibility.\n- Significance of contributionsResults suggest that expert gaze, when encoded as a video, can boost general-purpose LVLMs to rival or surpass task-specific medical models on key report-generation metrics.The paper encourages a promising line of human-in-the-loop prompting for clinical AI without retraining models.\n\n- Using video representations of expert gaze as a visual prompt for LVLMs is a simple, elegant idea that preserves scanpath order and duration, going beyond prior heatmap and text encodings.\n- The approach leverages existing video interfaces of general-domain LVLMs without fine-tuning, offering a practical, lightweight pathway to incorporate human expertise.\n\n- The work compares three gaze encodings (heatmap, text, video) across multiple video-capable LVLMs and includes medical LVLM baselines, offering a broad perspective.\n- Ablations on frame count, fixation filtering, and in-context learning provide initial insight into design choices and their effects.\n\n- The motivation for preserving temporal order is clearly articulated; the video construction pipeline is easy to reproduce.\n- Prompts and experimental settings are described with reasonable detail; code availability for dataset reconstruction is useful for reproducibility.\n\n- Results suggest that expert gaze, when encoded as a video, can boost general-purpose LVLMs to rival or surpass task-specific medical models on key report-generation metrics.\n- The paper encourages a promising line of human-in-the-loop prompting for clinical AI without retraining models.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe study does not include critical controls to isolate the value of sequence information (e.g., shuffled scanpaths, duration-preserving but order-randomized videos, or order-preserving but location-scrambled controls).The impression task appears to take as input the ground-truth findings text (eq. 5), conflating summarization from text with image-grounded impression generation; this may inflate performance and complicate comparisons with prior work that conditions only on images.Details for heatmap construction (alpha blending, kernel size, opacity, image occlusion impact) and textual-gaze formatting are insufficient to ensure fair, optimized baselines.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesEvaluation relies heavily on a small “beta” split (62–92 cases) and a much larger “alpha” set that overlaps MIMIC-CXR training data; contamination risks remain high for medical baselines and possibly for some general models trained on web data containing MIMIC-derived content.No statistical significance testing or confidence intervals are reported, despite small test sizes and modest deltas in some settings.The composite “scaled to CheXagent = 100” score averages heterogeneous metrics (lexical and clinical) and can be distorted when denominators are small (e.g., CXRMate’s very high “scaled” findings). This makes across-model and across-task comparisons difficult to interpret.For diagnosis, the use of CheXbert micro-F1 over “all abnormalities” to assess differential diagnosis is under-specified; it is unclear how generated free text is mapped to labels and whether this aligns with the intended diagnostic task.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesEq. (7) text says the denominator is “LLaVA-Med” while the formula and narrative refer to CheXagent—this inconsistency should be fixed.Table 2 contains unclear modality support markings (parentheses, X/checkmarks) that need standardization and clearer explanation.The “Overall” metric definitions (which metrics are included, weighting) should be explicitly enumerated.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsRecent gaze–LVLM or gaze–VLP efforts are not adequately discussed, e.g., EGMA (gaze-guided VLP), MedGaze (scanpath prediction), CoRaX (gaze video for error correction), and broader visual prompting surveys; these would help situate the contribution.Discussion lacks comparisons or references to report-generation dialog systems such as RaDialog and how impression-from-findings vs image-only settings relate to prior evaluation protocols.\n\n- The study does not include critical controls to isolate the value of sequence information (e.g., shuffled scanpaths, duration-preserving but order-randomized videos, or order-preserving but location-scrambled controls).\n- The impression task appears to take as input the ground-truth findings text (eq. 5), conflating summarization from text with image-grounded impression generation; this may inflate performance and complicate comparisons with prior work that conditions only on images.\n- Details for heatmap construction (alpha blending, kernel size, opacity, image occlusion impact) and textual-gaze formatting are insufficient to ensure fair, optimized baselines.\n\n- Evaluation relies heavily on a small “beta” split (62–92 cases) and a much larger “alpha” set that overlaps MIMIC-CXR training data; contamination risks remain high for medical baselines and possibly for some general models trained on web data containing MIMIC-derived content.\n- No statistical significance testing or confidence intervals are reported, despite small test sizes and modest deltas in some settings.\n- The composite “scaled to CheXagent = 100” score averages heterogeneous metrics (lexical and clinical) and can be distorted when denominators are small (e.g., CXRMate’s very high “scaled” findings).

The fixed 5-pixel dot may be small relative to the (unspecified) input resolution; a brief analysis of dot size and visibility would be valuable.The assumption that longer fixations carry more diagnostic signal is reasonable, but the current filtering threshold (t_i > mean) is simplistic; a percentile-based threshold or model-agnostic saliency weighting could be tested.A key missing control is a “shuffled” condition that maintains the same set of fixation positions and durations but randomizes temporal order. This would directly test the hypothesis that sequential order per se contributes to the gains. Additional controls:Order-only vs location-only ablations (preserve order but jitter positions; preserve positions/durations but randomize order).A static “cumulative” heatmap baseline carefully tuned to avoid occlusion.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentSplits and contamination: Using the MIMIC-Eye training (“alpha”) data for evaluation introduces leakage with baselines trained on MIMIC-CXR; although the authors report alpha/beta separately, conclusions should be drawn primarily from the beta split and/or an external set (e.g., REFLACX/EGD-CXR). A leave-one-reader-out or cross-institution setup would strengthen claims of generalizability.Metrics and scaling: Averaging scaled metrics across dissimilar measures (ROUGE-L, BERTScore, CheXbert F1, RadGraph F1, RaTEScore) can obscure where gains truly come from. Please report raw clinical metric values (CheXbert, RadGraph, RaTEScore) and provide per-metric deltas with confidence intervals. Consider reporting composite metrics separately for lexical and clinical categories, rather than collapsing to a single “Overall”.Impression task protocol: If ground-truth findings are input, this becomes a text summarization task rather than an image-grounded impression generation. Provide a separate evaluation where impression is generated from images (+gaze) only, aligning with standard practice and fairer comparisons to image-conditioned baselines.Diagnosis evaluation: Clarify how diagnostic entities are extracted from the generated text, how CheXbert is applied to references vs predictions, and whether a radiology NER/normalization (e.g., SapBERT mapping) is used. Current framing of “differential diagnosis” versus CheXbert label sets needs alignment.Statistical rigor: Include CIs or bootstrap resampling and hypothesis testing across model–prompt conditions, especially on the beta split.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)EGMA (eye-gaze–guided pretraining) demonstrates that gaze can improve patch-sentence alignment; your work complements this by showing prompting-time benefits on report generation and diagnosis without finetuning. A discussion of training-time vs prompting-time gaze use would enrich the narrative.Kim et al. (heatmap/text prompting) is a direct comparator; emphasizing that RadEyeVideo preserves sequential order addresses a known limitation in those encodings.MedGaze (scanpath prediction) and CoRaX (gaze-video–guided error correction) both leverage spatio-temporal gaze signals. Citing them would position RadEyeVideo among broader gaze-temporal approaches, distinguishing your focus on LVLM prompting for report/diagnosis.GazeGNN encodes dwell but not temporal order; your results can be discussed as evidence that temporal dynamics matter at inference time for generative tasks.Visual prompting surveys could help contextualize how your “video gaze prompt” fits within the growing literature on non-text prompts for MLLMs/LVLMs.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceThe work highlights a low-cost, training-free avenue to inject expert attention patterns into LVLMs, which could be impactful in data-scarce clinical settings. It also opens the door to synthetic gaze augmentation (e.g., predicted scanpaths) where real gaze is unavailable.Risks and biases: Gaze reflects reading strategies that vary by expertise and institution, potentially encoding biases (e.g., search patterns differing by radiologist seniority). Eye overlays may also occlude subtle findings; rigorous analysis of occlusion effects should be included. Privacy considerations around gaze traces warrant deeper discussion (linkability to specific readers, work patterns).Reproducibility is aided by code for video construction; stronger open evaluation would come from publishing full per-case outputs and metrics, and testing on external datasets.\n\n- The core method—rendering gaze as a moving point with frame counts proportional to dwell time and uniformly sampling to a fixed frame budget—is sound and easy to reproduce. The fixed 5-pixel dot may be small relative to the (unspecified) input resolution; a brief analysis of dot size and visibility would be valuable.\n- The assumption that longer fixations carry more diagnostic signal is reasonable, but the current filtering threshold (t_i > mean) is simplistic; a percentile-based threshold or model-agnostic saliency weighting could be tested.\n- A key missing control is a “shuffled” condition that maintains the same set of fixation positions and durations but randomizes temporal order. This would directly test the hypothesis that sequential order per se contributes to the gains. Additional controls:Order-only vs location-only ablations (preserve order but jitter positions; preserve positions/durations but randomize order).A static “cumulative” heatmap baseline carefully tuned to avoid occlusion.\n\n- Order-only vs location-only ablations (preserve order but jitter positions; preserve positions/durations but randomize order).\n- A static “cumulative” heatmap baseline carefully tuned to avoid occlusion.\n\n- Splits and contamination: Using the MIMIC-Eye training (“alpha”) data for evaluation introduces leakage with baselines trained on MIMIC-CXR; although the authors report alpha/beta separately, conclusions should be drawn primarily from the beta split and/or an external set (e.g., REFLACX/EGD-CXR). A leave-one-reader-out or cross-institution setup would strengthen claims of generalizability.\n- Metrics and scaling: Averaging scaled metrics across dissimilar measures (ROUGE-L, BERTScore, CheXbert F1, RadGraph F1, RaTEScore) can obscure where gains truly come from. Please report raw clinical metric values (CheXbert, RadGraph, RaTEScore) and provide per-metric deltas with confidence intervals. Consider reporting composite metrics separately for lexical and clinical categories, rather than collapsing to a single “Overall”.\n- Impression task protocol: If ground-truth findings are input, this becomes a text summarization task rather than an image-grounded impression generation. Provide a separate evaluation where impression is generated from images (+gaze) only, aligning with standard practice and fairer comparisons to image-conditioned baselines.\n- Diagnosis evaluation: Clarify how diagnostic entities are extracted from the generated text, how CheXbert is applied to references vs predictions, and whether a radiology NER/normalization (e.g., SapBERT mapping) is used. Current framing of “differential diagnosis” versus CheXbert label sets needs alignment.\n- Statistical rigor: Include CIs or bootstrap resampling and hypothesis testing across model–prompt conditions, especially on the beta split.\n\n- EGMA (eye-gaze–guided pretraining) demonstrates that gaze can improve patch-sentence alignment; your work complements this by showing prompting-time benefits on report generation and diagnosis without finetuning. A discussion of training-time vs prompting-time gaze use would enrich the narrative.\n- Kim et al. (heatmap/text prompting) is a direct comparator; emphasizing that RadEyeVideo preserves sequential order addresses a known limitation in those encodings.\n- MedGaze (scanpath prediction) and CoRaX (gaze-video–guided error correction) both leverage spatio-temporal gaze signals. Citing them would position RadEyeVideo among broader gaze-temporal approaches, distinguishing your focus on LVLM prompting for report/diagnosis.\n- GazeGNN encodes dwell but not temporal order; your results can be discussed as evidence that temporal dynamics matter at inference time for generative tasks.\n- Visual prompting surveys could help contextualize how your “video gaze prompt” fits within the growing literature on non-text prompts for MLLMs/LVLMs.\n\n- The work highlights a low-cost, training-free avenue to inject expert attention patterns into LVLMs, which could be impactful in data-scarce clinical settings. It also opens the door to synthetic gaze augmentation (e.g., predicted scanpaths) where real gaze is unavailable.\n- Risks and biases: Gaze reflects reading strategies that vary by expertise and institution, potentially encoding biases (e.g., search patterns differing by radiologist seniority). Eye overlays may also occlude subtle findings; rigorous analysis of occlusion effects should be included. Privacy considerations around gaze traces warrant deeper discussion (linkability to specific readers, work patterns).\n- Reproducibility is aided by code for video construction; stronger open evaluation would come from publishing full per-case outputs and metrics, and testing on external datasets.\n\n### Questions for Authors\n\n- For impression generation, do all models receive the ground-truth findings text as input (eq. 5)? If so, can you report a complementary setting where impression is generated from the image (+gaze) only, to enable fairer comparison with past work?\n- Did you run a “shuffled scanpath” control (same fixation set and durations, randomized order) or other order/location ablations to isolate the benefit of temporal order?\n- How exactly are diagnosis outputs evaluated with CheXbert? Is CheXbert applied to the generated text and compared to CheXbert labels of the reference report? How are synonyms, negations, and non-CheXpert findings handled?\n- How were in-context exemplar reports selected? Are they drawn from the same alpha/beta distributions, and is there any risk of overlap with evaluation cases? Did you match exemplars by pathology or randomly?\n- Please detail the heatmap generation (kernel/opacity/alpha blending/resolution) and whether you ensured minimal occlusion of diagnostically critical structures. Could suboptimal heatmap rendering explain underperformance?\n- What was the CXR resolution fed to each model, and how large (in pixels or degrees of visual angle) was the red dot relative to the model’s input size? Did you test alternative dot sizes or visual encodings (e.g., trailing path, variable-radius indicating dwell)?\n- Can you provide raw per-metric results (CheXbert F1, RadGraph F1, RaTEScore) and significance tests for beta split results? The current scaled “Overall” averages are hard to interpret.\n- Beyond MIMIC-Eye, did you try any external validation (e.g., REFLACX or EGD-CXR) to assess generalization and reduce concerns about MIMIC-CXR overlap with baselines?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper presents a simple and practical idea—encoding clinician gaze as a short video—and demonstrates that it can meaningfully improve general-domain LVLMs on CXR report-related tasks without training. The approach is well-motivated, the implementation is clear, and the empirical gains, especially on impression summarization, are promising. At the same time, the evaluation has notable weaknesses: reliance on a small test split and an overlapping training split, lack of statistical testing, heterogeneous and potentially distorting metric scaling, and an impression-task setup that appears to use ground-truth findings as input. Crucially, the claim that temporal order matters would be much stronger with shuffled-order controls and clearer, raw clinical metrics on an uncontaminated test set.\n\nOverall, I see this as a solid, original prompting contribution with practical value, but in its current form it falls short of top-tier standards due to methodological and reporting gaps. Addressing contamination concerns, adding order-specific ablations, clarifying the impression task conditioning, and reporting raw clinical metrics with significance on a clean test set would substantially strengthen the paper and its claims.",

The method is evaluated on the MIMIC‑Eye dataset for findings generation, impression summarization, and differential diagnosis, showing consistent advantages over baselines without gaze input and over heatmap- or text‑based gaze encodings. The paper is clearly written, with a transparent motivation for temporally preserving gaze information, detailed methodological description, and accompanying code release facilitating reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Controls for Sequence Information** – The study lacks key control experiments to isolate the contribution of temporal order (e.g., shuffled scanpaths or duration‑preserving but order‑randomized videos). Without these, the benefit attributed to sequential gaze information remains untested.  \n2. **Impression-Task Protocol** – Equation (5) suggests the impression task conditions on ground‑truth findings text rather than the image alone, making the task a text summarization problem rather than image‑grounded impression generation. This design may inflate performance and hinders fair comparison with prior image-only baselines.  \n3. **Baseline Construction and Fairness** – Details for heatmap generation (alpha blending, kernels, opacity, occlusion handling) and textual‑gaze formatting are insufficient, limiting reproducibility and fairness across gaze modalities.  \n4. **Dataset Splits and Contamination** – The evaluation heavily depends on an “alpha” split overlapping with MIMIC‑CXR training data, raising contamination concerns for medical and general baselines. Conclusions should rest primarily on the smaller but cleaner “beta” set, or on an external dataset.  \n5. **Statistical and Metric Rigor** – The study reports no significance tests or confidence intervals despite small sample sizes. The composite “scaled to CheXagent = 100” measure mixes heterogeneous metrics and can distort relative comparisons. Raw and per‑metric results (e.g., CheXbert, RadGraph, RaTEScore) with confidence intervals are needed.  \n6. **Diagnosis Evaluation Clarity** – Mapping from generated text to CheXbert labels is under‑specified; the definition of “differential diagnosis” in this context requires clearer justification.  \n7. **Presentation and Consistency** – Equation (7) inconsistently cites denominators (“LLaVA‑Med” vs. CheXagent); Table 2’s modality markings and “Overall” metric composition should be clearly described.  \n8. **Related Work** – Discussion should include recent gaze‑based VLP and LVLM approaches (e.g., EGMA, MedGaze, CoRaX), as well as report‑generation dialogue systems like RaDialog, to better contextualize contributions.  \n9. **Additional Analyses** – Evaluate the influence of red‑dot size, fixation filtering thresholds, and possible occlusion of findings. Include shuffled or ablated controls (order‑only vs. location‑only) to reinforce claims about the importance of temporal sequence.  \n10. **Broader Impact Considerations** – Address variability and potential bias in gaze behaviors across expertise levels, privacy issues in gaze traces, and possible occlusion artifacts introduced by gaze overlays.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify heatmap rendering parameters to ensure equitable baseline comparison.  \n- Correct labeling inconsistencies in formulae and tables, and standardize notation.  \n- Explicitly list which metrics are included in the “Overall” score and their weights.  \n- Provide external validation results where possible to support generalization.  \n- Several references to visual prompting and gaze‑guided models could be added to situate the work more completely.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThis paper proposes an elegant, lightweight method that exploits video representations of expert gaze to enhance LVLMs without additional training. The idea is clear and its implementation straightforward, offering practical value and reproducibility through code release.

Strengthening experimental rigor, clarifying task inputs, reporting unscaled clinical metrics, and expanding discussion to recent related research would substantially increase the manuscript’s credibility and impact.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The concept and motivation are strong, but methodological and reporting issues must be addressed before the contribution can be considered robust.",

        "text": "# Review Report for \"RADEYEVIDEO: ENHANCING GENERAL-DOMAIN LARGE VISION LANGUAGE MODEL FOR CHEST X-RAY ANALYSIS WITH VIDEO REPRESENTATIONS OF EYE GAZE\"\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis manuscript addresses the limitation of current approaches that integrate radiologists' eye gaze information into large vision-language models (LVLMs) for chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. While previous methods have incorporated eye gaze through static heatmaps or textual prompts, they fail to preserve the temporal sequence of eye movements that could provide valuable context about how radiologists prioritize different regions during interpretation. The authors propose RadEyeVideo, a novel approach that represents eye gaze as dynamic video sequences where a red dot follows the radiologist's actual fixation pattern across the CXR image. This method captures both spatial attention and temporal dynamics of gaze, creating a more comprehensive representation of expert visual behavior. The authors evaluate their approach on three general-domain LVLMs (LongVA, VideoLLaMA2, and LLaVA-OneVision) across CXR report generation (findings and impressions) and diagnosis tasks. Their results demonstrate significant performance improvements, with RadEyeVideo achieving up to 25.4% gain on the Impression generation task and an average 7.9% improvement across all tasks. Remarkably, when combined with exemplar reports for in-context learning, general-domain LVLMs with RadEyeVideo outperform medical models specifically trained for CXR analysis, including the state-of-the-art CXRMate model in the Impression section.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The paper presents a novel and conceptually simple approach that addresses a clear gap in current eye-gaze integration methods by preserving temporal dynamics.\n- The comprehensive evaluation across multiple models, tasks, and metrics provides strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n- The ablation studies (frame numbers, gaze point filtering, in-context learning) provide valuable insights into the design choices and enhance methodological rigor.\n- The demonstration that general-domain LVLMs with RadEyeVideo can outperform medical-specific models is a significant contribution with practical implications for clinical AI deployment.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The evaluation dataset is quite small, particularly the beta set with only 92 images, which limits the statistical power of the findings. The paper mentions this limitation but doesn't sufficiently address how it might affect the reliability of the reported performance gains.\n- The diagnosis task results are inconsistent across models (e.g., performance degradation with VideoLLaMA2), and the paper doesn't adequately explore why this occurs or discuss clinical implications of these inconsistencies.\n- While the paper claims the temporal sequence is critical, it doesn't provide direct evidence that the temporal aspect specifically (rather than just the visual salience of the video format) drives the performance improvement. A controlled experiment comparing video with shuffled gaze sequences would strengthen this claim.\n\n### Minor Comments\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The figures effectively illustrate the differences between prompting methods and showcase the quality improvements in generated reports.\n- The detailed description of the gaze video construction process provides clear methodology for replication.\n- The inclusion of computational efficiency analysis (Appendix A.1) addresses a practical concern about video processing overhead.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- The manuscript would benefit from more detailed discussion about the clinical relevance of the performance improvements beyond metric scores.\n- Some figures (e.g., Figure 3) contain text that is difficult to read at the resolution provided, making it hard to fully assess the qualitative improvements claimed.\n- The paper could better clarify why the video approach outperforms the fixation text method, given that both contain temporal information (though in different formats).\n- The discussion section would be strengthened by addressing potential implementation challenges in clinical settings where real-time eye-tracking might not be feasible.\n\n## 3. Evaluation Against TMI Editorial Criteria\n\n**Significance (High):** This work addresses an important challenge in medical AI—bridging the gap between general-purpose and medical-specific models. The demonstrated ability of general-domain LVLMs with RadEyeVideo to outperform medical models has significant implications for clinical deployment, as it reduces the need for specialized medical model training while maintaining or improving performance. The approach could be extended beyond CXR to other medical imaging modalities, potentially impacting various diagnostic workflows.\n\n**Innovation (High):** The core innovation of representing eye gaze as video sequences rather than static heatmaps or text is conceptually novel and effectively addresses the limitation of previous methods that discard temporal dynamics. The paper clearly demonstrates how this approach captures the expert's visual search strategy in a way that provides more meaningful context to LVLMs. The comparison across multiple gaze integration methods provides a comprehensive benchmark that advances the field.\n\n**Evaluation (Moderate-High):** The evaluation is generally strong, with multiple models, comprehensive metrics (both general lexical and radiology-specific), and ablation studies. However, the small test set size (92 images) limits the statistical robustness of the findings. While the paper includes thorough metric reporting, it would be strengthened by more qualitative analysis of the clinical relevance of the improvements and deeper investigation into why certain models benefit more than others from the video approach.\n\n**Reproducibility (High):** The paper provides clear methodological details for recreating the gaze videos and specifies all hyperparameters. The authors mention code availability in supplementary materials, and the use of publicly available models and datasets (MIMIC-CXR) enhances reproducibility. The computational efficiency analysis in the appendix further supports practical implementation.\n\n## 4. Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision (Reject/Resubmit)**\n\nWhile this paper presents a novel and potentially impactful approach with strong empirical results, several concerns need to be addressed before acceptance. The primary issues are the limited dataset size for evaluation and the lack of direct evidence that the temporal sequence (rather than just the visual format) drives performance improvements. The authors should:\n\n1. Provide additional analysis that specifically isolates the contribution of temporal information (e.g., comparing with shuffled gaze sequences)\n2. Address the inconsistency in diagnosis task performance across models with deeper analysis\n3. Include a more thorough discussion of clinical relevance beyond metric scores\n4. Expand the discussion on implementation challenges in real clinical settings\n\nThese revisions would strengthen the paper's methodological rigor and clinical relevance, making it a more compelling contribution to the field. The core idea is promising and the current results are encouraging, but additional analysis is needed to fully substantiate the claims about the importance of temporal gaze sequence and the clinical applicability of the approach.",

The authors evaluate RadEyeVideo across three LVLMs (LongVA, VideoLLaMA2, and LLaVA-OneVision) on report generation and diagnostic tasks. Reported results show up to 25.4% improvement in impression generation and an average 7.9% gain overall, with general-domain LVLMs augmented by RadEyeVideo surpassing medical-specific models such as CXRMate.

        "text": "**## A summary of the paper**\n\nThe manuscript tackles the under‑exploited information contained in radiologists’ eye‑gaze sequences when interpreting chest X‑rays (CXRs). Using the MIMIC‑Eye resource, which supplies fixation coordinates and dwell times for 2,298 posterior‑anterior CXRs, the authors generate a video prompt—named **RadEyeVideo**—that superimposes a red dot at the gaze location and samples frames in proportion to fixation duration. This construction preserves both spatial and temporal aspects of visual attention. Three publicly available large vision‑language models (LVLMs) capable of ingesting video input (LongVA, VideoLLaMA2, and LLaVA‑OneVision) are then evaluated on report‑generation (Findings, Impression) and disease‑diagnosis tasks, with in‑context exemplar reports supplied. Compared with a baseline that omits eye‑gaze information, the RadEyeVideo prompt yields up to a 25.4 % improvement for Impression generation and an average increase of 7.9 % across all evaluated tasks. The main contribution is the introduction of a dynamic eye‑gaze video prompting strategy that injects expert visual attention into existing LVLMs, demonstrating measurable gains in CXR reporting and diagnosis.\n\n---\n\n**## General feedback**\n\n- **Significance:** Demonstrating that temporal eye‑gaze data can boost off‑the‑shelf LVLMs for radiology is an encouraging step toward more human‑centered AI. It suggests a path for broader adoption of general‑purpose multimodal models within clinical workflows.  \n\n- **Innovation:** Encoding scan‑paths as a video prompt is a fresh perspective compared with earlier static heat‑maps or textual representations of gaze. The approach is conceptually elegant, yet it relies on a relatively simple overlay and uniform frame sampling; no new model architecture or training objective is introduced.  \n\n- **Evaluation:**  \n  - The experimental dataset is modest (≈2.3 k images) and the “beta” validation/test split contains only **92** images (Table 1). This raises concerns about statistical robustness and the possibility of data leakage, given that the split mixes training and test images.  \n  - Performance is reported using a **scaled‑metric** (Eq. 7) anchored to CheXagent, which inflates the numbers and makes it difficult to gauge the raw improvements; raw metric values are not consistently presented.  \n  - The reported average gain (~8 %) is modest, and some cases show a performance drop (e.g., diagnosis with VideoLLaMA2). No confidence intervals, p‑values, or bootstrapped estimates are provided.  \n  - The ablation study (Figure 4) examines only frame count, gaze‑point filtering, and the choice of in‑context exemplars; other design choices—such as dot size, motion smoothing, or alternative sampling strategies—remain unexplored.  \n\n- **Reproducibility:** The authors state that code for reconstructing the eye‑gaze videos is included in the supplementary material, yet the raw gaze data cannot be released because of MIMIC‑CXR licensing restrictions. Detailed preprocessing steps (e.g., fixation‑duration threshold, fps = 10, radius = 5 px), LVLM inference hyper‑parameters, and the scaling procedure are described only in narrative form, which hampers exact replication.\n\n---\n\n**## Specific comments / critiques**\n\n1. **Dataset split and potential leakage** – Section 3.1 describes a mixture of the MIMIC‑CXR training split with the test split (α/β), and the β split comprises just 92 images (Table 1). A clean, fully held‑out test set would help avoid contamination and enable reliable statistical analysis.  \n\n2. **Metric scaling methodology** – Equation 7 uses CheXagent as a reference to produce scaled scores (Table 3). This non‑standard scaling inflates the numbers and masks the true magnitude of improvement. The manuscript should also report the raw ROUGE, BERTScore, CheXbert, RadGraph, and RaTEScore values alongside the scaled versions.  \n\n3. **Statistical significance absent** – No confidence intervals, p‑values, or bootstrapping are presented for the reported 7.9 % average gain or the 25.4 % boost on Impression, despite the very small test set. Providing statistical validation is essential to substantiate these claims.  \n\n4. **Limited ablation scope** – Figure 4 investigates only the number of frames (16 selected) and a simple duration‑based fixation filter (Eq. 1). Other video‑encoding parameters—dot radius, colour, motion smoothing, frame‑rate variations—are not examined, leaving open whether the observed gains are specific to the chosen settings.  \n\n5. **Baseline coverage** – The comparison includes CheXagent, CXRMate, CXR‑LLaVA, and LLaVA‑Med, but omits several recent state‑of‑the‑art medical LVLMs (e.g., MedChat‑XL, Flamingo‑Med). Moreover, the paper does not evaluate these models after fine‑tuning on the eye‑gaze data, which would give a fuller picture of the benefit provided by the video prompt.  \n\n6. **Clinical relevance unclear** – A 7–8 % increase on scaled metrics may not translate into clinically meaningful improvements. The manuscript would benefit from an error analysis linking metric gains to changes in critical decisions (e.g., reduction of missed pneumonias).  \n\n7. **Privacy and bias considerations** – Although an ethical statement is present, the paper does not discuss the privacy implications of releasing processed gaze trajectories nor the potential bias stemming from a single radiologist cohort. These issues warrant further discussion.  \n\n8. **Reproducibility details missing** – No concrete repository URL is provided, and the preprocessing pipeline (frame‑sampling formula Eq. 2, fixation‑filtering threshold Eq. 1) is described only in prose. Supplying a runnable script with clear documentation would greatly aid replication.  \n\n9. **Presentation quality** – The manuscript contains several typographical errors (e.g., “Singificant”, “point‑f”), inconsistent naming (RADEYEVIDEO vs. RadEyeVideo), and fragmented numbered line blocks that hinder readability. Figures 1, 2, 5, 6 and Tables 3‑9 are crowded, making extraction of key numbers difficult.\n\n---\n\n**## A suggested decision**\n\n**Reject**  \nIn its present form the manuscript falls short of the originality and methodological rigor required for publication. Substantial revisions—particularly regarding dataset handling, statistical validation, broader baselines, and reproducibility—would be needed before it could be reconsidered.",

    "abstract": "Pre-training medical image encoder to provide robust, task-agnostic representations is highly valuable, as it enhances the understanding of medical images and is important for performing many data-scarce analysis tasks. Current pre-training works are unable to integrate various types of supervisions, including self-supervision and external supervision such as segmentation annotations, while they are highly valuable for medical image understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we take the first step toward exploring unifying all common types of supervisions into a pre-training framework through a same scalable way. This require the pre-training framework being both unified, for accommodating diverse data and extensible, and effective, for making heterogeneous data synergistically assist unknown downstream tasks. To this end, we propose UmiF, whose principle is that once converted into token embeddings in a unified space, all diverse supervisions can be effectively utilized via contrastive learning and mask modeling with a same way. With UmiF, we pre-train on 1.66M samples from 14 public datasets, significantly surpassing previous efforts in terms of the dataset scale. We obtain and release the UmiF model, which achieved state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection, retrieval and VQA.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe Authors propose UmiF, a framework that aims to unify pre-training of any arbitrary Image-Label pair to train a robust encoder for any modality. To achieve this the authors propose three tokenizers, that each allows embedding to a shared unified token space (One Image, One Text, One Image Labels/Segmentation). These image / label tokens are either left split or merged to a certain degree, before being used for SSL training through contrastive training in a CLIP'esque fashion or through a reconstruction task. \nThey train their model on a wide variety of paired pre-training datasets and evaluate it on a broad set of downstream tasks, highlighting the final performance of UmiF's method.\n\nWhile innovative, the experiments are insufficient to highlight the proposed methodology. The authors stack a) a larger pre-training dataset b) Token mixing c) Masked and Contrastive losses together and don't provide experiments that disentangle which part brings performance and which part does not. Moreover, the presentation and language used in this paper are of insufficient quality and need a lot of work.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe proposal to not only include Image-Report pairs but also Images with other Supervision signals is an interesting and to my knowledge novel premise for the medical domain. Their idea of mixing image and supervision tokens are also innovative.\nMoreover, the amount of experiments conducted is broad, highlighting the generality of the ViT feature extractor.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nWhile the premises are highly interesting the paper in it's current form has some issues:\n1. **Stacking of contributions** Currently the authors stack a variety of things on-top and don't ablate it properly, namely a) a larger pre-training dataset b) the token mixing block and c) the multiple SSL losses. Currently, it is impossible for a reader to know if their methodology is better downstream than the competing methods, as they create a much larger training data corpus. Maybe it's the masked reconstruction component, maybe not.\n2. **Presentation** The presentation of the paper as of right now is poor. It was very hard to read, as the language quality leaves a lot of room for improvement and should be checked by an English speaker to rework the manuscript. Moreover, Fig. 1 does a bad job of explaining the method contributing to difficulties in understanding the proposed method. Figures in the appendix are badly presented: Fig. 2 text is way too large.  Table 3 does not have a caption, The description of the Image-Segment Dataset (Section A.4) is basically non-existent and should be filled accordingly. \n3. **Reproducibility** Currently the author's don't sufficiently explain their configuration of their methods. How was _r_ chosen ? In the text it is mentioned sometimes 1 and sometimes random between [0,1]. How did the authors split their data? Was there a train-test split during pre-training and fine-tuning? Was there different weightings between the losses?\n\n### Minor Points\n- The ablation of _r_ values does not contain r of 0.9 and 1.0 - It's mentioned in the text that these performed substantially worse, but I would like to have these values included in the table. Moreover this table should provide not only RSNA 1% AUC values. The downstream adaptation are just learning of a linear-layer so please provide ablations on more datasets and all values to show if the mixing of tokens actually provides a benefit.\n- The distinction between what this paper does relative to other paper's feels not well worked out. It would help a lot to see what makes this work distinct.\n- Similarities to MedUniC Paper. This paper's Table 2 is very similar to their Table 2 -- I would prefer to highlight this in the caption. \n- There are so many typos in this manuscripts. E.g. spellings of baseline methods:  MedKLIIP/MedKILP/MedKLIP. It feels like no one proof-read this paper ever.\n- The Algorithm 1 is way too text heavy. If the authors want to go into detail about the sampling of their datasets they should move this into a separate algorithm to keep readability high.\n- The authors mention the importance of sampling smaller dataset more regularly but provide no results. Would be great to see an ablation table on this claim in the appendix.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Q1: Did you ablate the importance of using the masking and the contrastive loss by themselves?\n- Q2: How was _r_ chosen?\n- Q3: Shouldn't r be symmetric around 0.5? r=0 would just flip image embeddings to supervision and the other way around. Is this correct, or if not why not? \n- Q4: Have you tried replacing the mixing with a standard masking/token drop-out layer? Would be interesting to see if one actually has to mix tokens or if the dropping of tokens provides a similar regularizing effect.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The approach employs three tokenizers to embed images, text, and image labels/segmentations into a shared token space for self-supervised learning using contrastive and reconstruction objectives. The authors train on multiple paired datasets and evaluate on a range of downstream tasks to demonstrate generality. While the conceptual premise is novel and the experimental coverage broad, the paper suffers from weak presentation and limited experimental analysis that prevents a clear understanding of each component’s contribution to overall performance.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Disentangling Contributions** – The method combines several elements (large pre-training dataset, token mixing, and multiple self-supervised losses) without adequate ablation. The lack of controlled experiments makes it unclear which components drive performance improvements relative to baselines.  \n2. **Presentation Quality** – The manuscript is difficult to read due to poor language and unclear explanations. Figures are inconsistently formatted and inadequately described. Figure 1 fails to clearly convey the model workflow; Figure 2 text is oversized; Table 3 lacks a caption; and the dataset description in Appendix A.4 is incomplete.  \n3. **Reproducibility and Experimental Detail** – Important configuration details are missing. The selection of the hyperparameter *r* is inconsistently described (sometimes fixed, sometimes random). The data splitting strategy for pre-training and fine-tuning is unclear, as are the weighting schemes for different losses. These omissions limit replicability.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Include additional *r* values (e.g., 0.9 and 1.0) in the ablation table and report full downstream results on more datasets.  \n- Clarify how this work differs from related methods, especially MedUniC, and explicitly note similarities in Table 2.  \n- Correct numerous typographical errors, especially inconsistent spellings of baseline names.  \n- Simplify Algorithm 1 or split it for readability.  \n- Provide ablation results for the sampling frequency of smaller datasets.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe concept of unifying visual pre-training across different supervision types is original and promising for the medical domain. However, the current version lacks clarity, methodological transparency, and sufficient ablation to support its claims. The writing quality and figure presentation require significant improvement for readers to follow the technical contributions. These issues collectively reduce both interpretability and reproducibility, overshadowing the paper’s innovative potential.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The framework is interesting and broadly applicable, but substantial revisions to experimental analysis and presentation are necessary before acceptance.",

UmiF creates a common embedding space with a token grouping strategy to leverage diverse data types for various downstream tasks. Pre-trained on 1.66 million samples from 14 public datasets, UmiF was evaluated in classification, segmentation, detection, retrieval, and VQA tasks.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The paper introduces unifying representations from multiple supervisions into a single embedding space for self-supervised learning and proposes a grouping strategy for mixed learning of representation vectors.\n\n- The model’s effectiveness is validated through evaluations across four different downstream tasks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- **Contrastive Learning Design Concerns**: The design of the contrastive learning setup after grouping raises questions. According to the paper, a positive pair is represented by \\(f1_i, f0_j\\) where i and j are indices from different data points, meaning \\(f1_i\\) and \\(f0_j\\) are from different samples. Typically, a positive pair should be \\(f1_i, f0_i\\), where both elements come from the same sample, making the current approach unclear.\n\n- **Unfair Comparisons in Downstream Tasks**: There are substantial fairness issues in the downstream task comparisons. Competing models, such as Med-Unic and MGCA, are pre-trained on datasets with 380K and 217K samples respectively, whereas this study uses 1.66 million data pairs, including 1 million images. The model’s performance advantage in downstream tasks may stem from this large data disparity, making it difficult to attribute improvements solely to the proposed pre-training strategy.\n\n- **Performance in Table 2**: In Table 2, despite using more training data and supervision than Med-Unic, the proposed model does not achieve the best performance, which raises questions about the efficiency of the approach.\n\n- **Limited Ablation Study on Parameter r**: In the ablation study on the parameter r, only 1% of the RSNA dataset is used, rather than the full dataset, and no similar experiments are conducted on other datasets. It is unclear if the chosen r value on RSNA is robust and generalizable to other tasks, as this limited evaluation does not provide strong evidence of robustness.\n\n- **Inconsistencies Between Text and Figures**: There are inconsistencies between the text and figures. For instance, the text describes vector groups as Group 1 and Group 0, but the figure labels them as Group 1 and Group 2. \n\n- **CLS Token Generation Unclear**: The generation of the CLS token information is not clearly explained.  According to the figure, the CLS token appears to be an output of the Flexible Token Grouping, but the paper does not specify how the CLS token is produced. Further clarification on this process would improve understanding.\n\n### Questions\n\nplease refer to Weaknesses\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 5",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a multi-supervision unification strategy for medical image pretraining. The method allows report, segmentation, and classification (+ some others) types of supervision to jointly train one representation. The used modality is Chest X-ray (CXR). The authors collected a large-scale dataset sourced from the public domain, reaching 1M images and 1.66M supervision labels. It is reported the model, namely, UmiF reaches SOTA for a number of downstream tasks.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The authors have gone through tremendous effort in collecting and inventorying the datasets. I can imagine the implementation wouldn't be easy to iron out the differences in the datasets and put them together to train one model. For that, I believe the significance of the paper should be pointed out.\n\n2. the benchmarking is comprehensive, ranging over the common medical image analysis tasks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The clarity of the paper is a concern. Many places in the text lack proper explanation and are somewhat confusing.  For example, L230 \"This interesting design allows more diverse views and enriches the learning tasks with many possibilities, surpassing previous VL learning approaches.\", The authors should clearly state why it is interesting. What are the many possibilities? What are the other diverse views (isn't the modality just CXR)? What evidence indicates your method surpasses the previous VL learning approach?\n2. Furthermore, Sec 3.2, perhaps the most important section in the paper is not well written, I've read it a few times and I still don't believe I have grasped the exact approach. \n3. I find Figure 1 hard to follow, the quantities in Sec 3.2 should be mapped to the figure. I also don't get the colour coding in Figure 1 for those tokens. The yellow/blue/no boundary cubes are also a very confusing way of presentation.\n4. The improvement over the previous state-of-the-art is marginal around 1 point in various measurements. As the authors claim a large-scale dataset of 1.66M image-supervision pairs vs \"previous effort of mostly limited to 380K image-report pairs or 838K images\", it is worth rethinking whether the effort spent on training such a large model on the twice amount of data makes sense.\n5. The title claims \"learning robust representation for medical images ...\", medical images are not just CXR, I would recommend claiming a lesser scope unless common modalities such as MRI/CT are also used.\n6. In Sec 3.1, the authors use \"modality abstraction\", which sounds cool but I would say it is actually confusing, the procedure is a label format conversion.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease address weaknesses #2&4. The paper could use some professional editing services.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 3",

The authors compile a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 1 million images and 1.66 million supervision labels from publicly available sources. Experimental results indicate that UmiF achieves state-of-the-art performance across several downstream medical imaging tasks. While the topic and ambition of the work are notable, the clarity and explanatory depth of key methodological sections raise concerns about comprehensibility and interpretability.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Clarity and Explanation**: Several parts of the manuscript, such as the description around line 230 and Section 3.2, lack clear justification or illustrative explanation. Phrases like “interesting design” and “more diverse views” are vague and not sufficiently supported by evidence or examples. The reviewer reports difficulty understanding the exact approach after multiple readings.  \n2. **Presentation of Figures**: Figure 1 is difficult to follow. The quantitative elements described in Section 3.2 should be directly mapped to the figure, and the current color coding (yellow/blue/no boundary cubes) adds confusion rather than clarity.  \n3. **Magnitude of Improvement**: The reported performance gains over state-of-the-art methods are minimal (approximately one point across metrics). Given the significant effort and data scale increase—from 380K to 1.66M image-label pairs—the practical justification for this large-scale training should be reconsidered.  \n4. **Scope of Claims**: The title suggests representation learning for “medical images” broadly, but experiments use only chest X-rays. The claim should be limited accordingly unless additional modalities such as MRI or CT are included.  \n5. **Terminology**: The term “modality abstraction” in Section 3.1 is potentially misleading and appears to refer primarily to label format conversion.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The paper could benefit from professional language editing to improve readability.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nThe study introduces an ambitious and comprehensive data unification for medical image pretraining, demonstrating strong effort in dataset curation and broad benchmarking.

        "text": "**Phase 1: Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript presents a methodological contribution in medical imaging: a unified pre‑training framework (UmiF) for medical image encoders that integrates multiple supervision types (self‑supervision, segmentation, classification, and vision‑language signals). This is model- and representation-learning methodology directly within TMI scope.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe work claims to be the first to unify four major forms of supervision in medical image pre‑training. The central innovations are (1) a unified token space for diverse modalities (image, text, segmentation mask) and (2) a “flexible token grouping” strategy enabling various contrastive and masked modeling tasks simultaneously. While the conceptual idea—unifying multimodal supervision—is inspired by recent general-domain vision‑language models (e.g., OFA, BEiT‑style unification), its systematic adaptation to heterogeneous medical datasets constitutes a meaningful advance for the domain. The degree of novelty is moderate‑to‑high for medical imaging methodology.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nTechnical formulation is sound and internally consistent. Loss functions for contrastive and consistency learning are detailed. Experimental evaluation is broad—covering classification, segmentation, detection, VQA, and zero‑shot tasks—on public datasets totaling 1.66 M pairs. Comparisons to state‑of‑the‑art (MGCA, Med‑UniC, MRM) are appropriate. A potential concern is the uniform data harmonization using GPT‑4 translation and report generation, which may introduce bias or unverified text quality; this should be discussed more quantitatively. Reproducibility could also be strengthened by specifying tokenization vocabulary sizes, exact backbone configuration, and ablation hyperparameters.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe manuscript is generally well structured and readable. Major figures and tables are clear, though minor grammar issues remain (“to to acquire”, “being both unified, for accommodating diverse data and extensible, and effective” etc.). Sections are logically organized; however, some sentences are overly long, and acronyms (e.g., UmiF) could be introduced earlier.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nAll datasets are public, and IRB risk is minimal. Authors state intent to release code and checkpoints upon acceptance and clearly acknowledge limitations and bias risks—appropriate under TMI policy.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThis paper proposes *UmiF*, a unified medical‑image pre‑training framework that jointly leverages self‑supervision (contrastive and mask modeling) and external supervision (text reports, captions, class labels, segmentation masks) to learn robust task‑agnostic representations. The approach converts all modalities into a shared token space via modality‑specific tokenizers and processes them through a single Vision Transformer. A flexible token‑grouping mechanism randomly partitions tokens across modalities to form paired views for contrastive learning and mask modeling, effectively fusing heterogeneous supervision types. Pre‑training on 1.66 M samples from 14 datasets, UmiF achieves consistent state‑of‑the‑art performance across five downstream tasks.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological innovation in unifying diverse supervision sources under one scalable backbone.  \n- Comprehensive empirical validation across multiple downstream tasks and data‑efficiency regimes.  \n- Solid conceptual grounding linking self‑supervised and vision‑language paradigms.  \n- Demonstrates potential for generalized medical foundation models.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Limited theoretical justification for why flexible token grouping yields synergy; mostly empirical.  \n- Heavy reliance on GPT‑4‑generated or translated reports introduces potential data and linguistic bias not formally evaluated.  \n- Experiments restricted to 2D X‑ray data; unclear how easily the approach extends to other modalities (CT, MRI, pathology).  \n- Some reproducibility details (data splits, tokenizer parameters, random seeds) are missing.  \n- Writing quality could be improved for clarity and grammar.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify the contribution boundary** – Provide more explicit comparison to general-domain unified frameworks (OFA, BEiT, Painter), explaining which design changes are uniquely required for medical data.  \n2. **Quantify generated‑text quality** – Include metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, or radiologist manual ratings) to confirm the reliability of GPT‑generated translations and synthetic reports.  \n3. **Explain scalability beyond X‑ray** – Discuss adaptations needed for volumetric or multi‑channel modalities.  \n4. **Expand reproducibility details** – Document tokenizer vocabulary sizes, ViT configuration, and sampling probabilities.  \n5. **Statistical analysis** – Include standard deviation or confidence intervals for performance metrics to support claims of superiority.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Proofread for redundant words and grammatical errors.  \n- In tables, denote backbone sizes consistently (e.g., ViT‑B/16).  \n- Add visual examples showing outputs from the grouping strategy to aid intuitive understanding.  \n- Verify citation format consistency.  \n- Clarify timing and ratio of text versus mask tokens during training.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation:** **Major Revision**  \nThe paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful methodological contribution within TMI scope. However, it requires better justification of novelty relative to existing multimodal frameworks, quantitative validation of synthetic data quality, and detailed reproducibility information. With these revisions, it could reach publishable quality.\n\n**7.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper proposes UmiF, a unified medical image pre-training framework that integrates diverse supervision types including self-supervision, paired reports, captions, segmentation annotations, and classification labels. The method converts all input modalities (radiology, language, segmentation masks) into a unified token space using modality-specific tokenizers, then applies a flexible token grouping strategy to enable contrastive learning and mask modeling simultaneously. The authors compile a large-scale dataset of 1.66M samples from 14 public datasets, significantly exceeding previous efforts. UmiF uses Vision Transformer as backbone and trains with both alignment loss for contrastive learning and consistency loss for mask modeling. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, retrieval, and VQA on medical imaging datasets.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - Equation 1 uses inconsistent indexing notation where positive pairs are denoted as (f1i, f0j) but the loss function ℓ(fi, fj) uses different subscript conventions without clear mapping\n  - The binary sampling strategy in Section 3.2 lacks mathematical rigor in defining the probability distribution for sampling r values beyond stating \"certain probability\" and \"randomly sampled from [0, 1]\"\n  - Equation 2's consistency loss formulation doesn't clearly specify the relationship between teacher network input Concat(Xi, Xs) and the masked student inputs X0, X1\n\n• **Insufficient technical novelty and contribution clarity**\n  - The core tokenization approach directly borrows from existing works (Section 3.1 acknowledges similarity to Wang et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2023) without substantial methodological innovation\n  - The flexible token grouping strategy, while presented as novel, essentially reduces to standard vision-language learning when r=1 (page 5, lines 218-223), suggesting limited conceptual advancement\n  - The unification claim is overstated given that only three modality types are handled, and the abstraction is relatively straightforward (converting coordinates to masks, labels to text templates)\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - Table 2-5 comparisons include methods with different backbone architectures (ResNet-50 vs ViT-B/16), making performance comparisons potentially unfair without proper architectural controls\n  - The ablation study in Table 7 only examines single supervision types versus all combined, lacking systematic analysis of pairwise combinations to understand synergistic effects\n  - Zero-shot evaluation is limited to a single dataset (CXP500 with 500+ images), providing insufficient evidence for generalization claims across diverse medical imaging scenarios\n\n• **Dataset processing and experimental rigor concerns**\n  - The reliance on GPT-4 for Spanish-to-English translation and report generation (Section 2, Table 1) introduces potential biases and quality inconsistencies not adequately validated\n  - Algorithm 1 and Section 4.1 provide insufficient implementation details regarding the \"certain probability\" for r=1 setting, batch construction specifics, and convergence criteria\n  - The segmentation mask generation process (bottom of Figure 1) lacks technical details about color assignment, resolution matching, and potential information loss during coordinate-to-mask conversion\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Standardize indexing notation throughout Equation 1 by clearly defining the relationship between batch indices i,j and the positive pair construction\n  - Provide explicit probability distributions for the flexible token grouping strategy, including mathematical formulation of the sampling process for r values\n  - Clarify the mathematical relationship in Equation 2 between complete teacher inputs and masked student inputs, potentially with a formal algorithm description\n\n• **Strengthen technical contributions and positioning**\n  - Conduct deeper analysis comparing the proposed tokenization approach with existing methods, highlighting specific advantages beyond scalability\n  - Provide theoretical or empirical analysis of when and why the flexible grouping strategy outperforms standard vision-language approaches beyond the r=1 case\n  - Expand the modality abstraction framework to handle additional medical data types (e.g., 3D volumes, multi-sequence MRI) to better support the \"unified\" framework claims\n\n• **Improve experimental comprehensiveness and fairness**\n  - Include systematic comparisons using identical backbone architectures across all baseline methods, or provide separate architectural ablation studies\n  - Design comprehensive ablation studies examining all pairwise and subset combinations of supervision types to quantify individual and synergistic contributions\n  - Expand zero-shot evaluation to multiple datasets and include few-shot learning scenarios to better demonstrate generalization capabilities across medical imaging domains\n\n• **Strengthen dataset validation and implementation transparency**\n  - Validate GPT-4 generated translations and reports through expert radiologist review or automated quality metrics comparison with original annotations\n  - Provide complete implementation details including hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, convergence behavior, and computational requirements for reproducibility\n  - Include technical validation of the coordinate-to-mask conversion process, potentially comparing with direct coordinate-based supervision methods to justify the design choice",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\n### This manuscript introduces UmiF, a unified medical image pre-training framework that integrates various types of supervisions, including self-supervisions and external supervisions such as segmentation annotations and class labels. UmiF aims to pre-train robust, task-agnostic representations for medical images by converting diverse input pairs into a unified token space and employing a novel flexible token grouping strategy for contrastive learning and mask modeling. The authors claim that UmiF surpasses previous efforts in terms of dataset scale and performance across multiple downstream tasks. The manuscript is well-written, with a clear articulation of the motivation and technical details.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While UmiF introduces a unique approach to integrating multiple supervisions, the novelty is somewhat diminished by existing works that have explored similar ideas. The authors should provide a clearer distinction between UmiF and existing methods, especially those that incorporate multi-modal pre-training or multi-task learning. The manuscript lacks a thorough discussion on how UmiF's contributions are differentiated from related work, which could strengthen the argument for its significance.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted on a diverse set of datasets, which is commendable. However, the authors should consider expanding the evaluation to include additional medical imaging modalities beyond 2D X-rays, such as CT scans or MRI images. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of UmiF's versatility and generalization capabilities. Additionally, the inclusion of more real-world, prospective datasets would bolster the practical applicability of the proposed framework.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares UmiF against a range of baselines, but some relevant recent works, particularly those focusing on vision-language pre-training and multi-modal contrastive learning, are missing. Including these comparisons would offer a more comprehensive view of UmiF's performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. The authors should ensure that the chosen baselines are representative of the latest advancements in the field.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors mention that the code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance, which is positive. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed description of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters. Providing this information upfront would enhance the reproducibility of the results and facilitate future research.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures and Tables: Figures 1 and 2 are somewhat cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative examples with zoomed-in regions to enhance readability.\n2. Notation and Terminology: Some notation is introduced without sufficient explanation, particularly in Section 2.1. Clarifying these definitions would aid in the understanding of the technical details.\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms are used without definition, such as \"ROC\" and \"SIIM.\" Providing a glossary or defining these terms would improve clarity.\n4. Typographical Issues: There are a few typographical errors throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). These should be corrected for a polished presentation.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical image analysis: creating robust, task-agnostic representations that can generalize well across various downstream tasks. UmiF's approach to integrating diverse supervisions into a unified framework is innovative and technically sound. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including a broader range of datasets and modalities. The reproducibility of the results is contingent on the completeness of the methodological details, which currently lack some crucial information. Overall, while the idea holds promise, the manuscript would benefit from expanded comparisons and a more comprehensive evaluation to fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include more recent and relevant methods, broaden the evaluation to include a wider range of datasets and modalities, and provide detailed methodological information to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "## LEARNING ROBUST REPRESENTATIONS FOR MEDICAL IMAGES VIA UNIFYING (SELF-)SUPERVISIONS\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes UmiF, a unified pre-training framework for medical image encoders that integrates heterogeneous supervision signals—self-supervision, paired language (reports/captions), classification labels, and segmentation annotations—through a single, scalable approach. The key idea is to convert all signals into a shared token space (radiology images, language, and segmentation masks) and apply a flexible token grouping strategy that yields two complementary views for contrastive learning and masked modeling using a single ViT backbone. Pre-trained on 1.66M pairs from 14 public datasets, UmiF reports strong or state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks, including classification, segmentation, detection, zero-shot classification, retrieval, and VQA.\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Technical novelty and innovationUnifies multiple supervision types (self-supervision, reports/captions, labels, segmentation) into one tokenized space and a single backbone without bespoke task-specific heads.The flexible token grouping ratio r elegantly generalizes CLIP-style cross-modal contrastive learning to mixed-modality token subsets and integrates masked modeling with a BYOL-style teacher, providing a principled mechanism to span from pure VL to mixed intra/inter-modal self-supervision.Treating segmentation annotations as an image modality to enable an image-centric tokenization path is a pragmatic and extensible design.\n- Experimental rigor and validationEvaluates across a broad suite of downstream tasks: linear classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, zero-shot classification, and VQA.Includes ablations on token grouping probability and supervision-type inclusion to probe the synergy of heterogeneous signals.\n- Clarity of presentationPresents a coherent high-level framework with clear motivation for unification and a conceptual figure illustrating tokenization, grouping, and training objectives.Clearly lists datasets and pretraining setup at a high level.\n- Significance of contributionsAddresses a highly relevant problem in medical imaging: leveraging diverse, small, and heterogeneously annotated datasets for robust pretraining.If released, the reported model could serve as a community resource across multiple downstream tasks, potentially reducing the need for task-specific pretraining.\n\nTechnical novelty and innovation\n\n- Unifies multiple supervision types (self-supervision, reports/captions, labels, segmentation) into one tokenized space and a single backbone without bespoke task-specific heads.\n- The flexible token grouping ratio r elegantly generalizes CLIP-style cross-modal contrastive learning to mixed-modality token subsets and integrates masked modeling with a BYOL-style teacher, providing a principled mechanism to span from pure VL to mixed intra/inter-modal self-supervision.\n- Treating segmentation annotations as an image modality to enable an image-centric tokenization path is a pragmatic and extensible design.\n\nExperimental rigor and validation\n\n- Evaluates across a broad suite of downstream tasks: linear classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, zero-shot classification, and VQA.\n- Includes ablations on token grouping probability and supervision-type inclusion to probe the synergy of heterogeneous signals.\n\nClarity of presentation\n\n- Presents a coherent high-level framework with clear motivation for unification and a conceptual figure illustrating tokenization, grouping, and training objectives.\n- Clearly lists datasets and pretraining setup at a high level.\n\nSignificance of contributions\n\n- Addresses a highly relevant problem in medical imaging: leveraging diverse, small, and heterogeneously annotated datasets for robust pretraining.\n- If released, the reported model could serve as a community resource across multiple downstream tasks, potentially reducing the need for task-specific pretraining.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Technical limitations or concernsThe segmentation supervision is relatively small (≈2K samples) compared to the overall corpus; claims about segmentation-driven gains may be confounded by the broader framework rather than true exploitation of segmentation annotations.Using RGB mask images for segmentation supervision is simple but may be suboptimal; it may encode class colors as strong priors without principled spatial alignment objectives.The design omits local alignment objectives (e.g., patch-to-token grounding) seen in related VLP works and may underutilize fine-grained supervision.\n- Experimental gaps or methodological issuesFairness of comparisons: UmiF pretrains on a substantially larger and more heterogeneous dataset than some baselines; apples-to-apples comparisons (e.g., pretrain on a single standardized corpus like MIMIC-CXR as in BenchX) are missing.Token grouping ablations are limited in scope (primarily one metric/setting); broader analysis across tasks and datasets would better justify the design.The ablation “only one supervision type” is confounded by drastically different data scales (e.g., segment data 2K vs. others hundreds of thousands), making “synergy” conclusions difficult to isolate from sample size effects.The approach to object detection using YOLOv3 with a ViT backbone is under-specified; how features are adapted is unclear, raising concerns about reproducibility.\n- Clarity or presentation issuesThe contrastive loss description ambiguously denotes positive pairs as (f1_i, f0_j); it should clarify that positives are derived from the same input pair (i=j) and specify projection heads if any.Limited details on the BYOL teacher (momentum, predictors, projection heads) and on the training recipe (initialization of ViT and tokenizers, augmentation policies).The batch sampling strategy first claims balancing across datasets but then samples proportionally to dataset size, which contradicts the balancing goal.\n- Missing related work or comparisonsLimited discussion of several close and recent efforts that unify or structure multimodal medical pretraining (e.g., IMITATE, CXR-CLIP, MedFLIP, BenchX framework and findings, DeViDe’s multi-granularity alignment, and MDT/IRENE-style unified token encoders).No controlled comparisons under standardized protocols (e.g., BenchX) to disentangle method gains from pretraining corpus differences.\n\nTechnical limitations or concerns\n\n- The segmentation supervision is relatively small (≈2K samples) compared to the overall corpus;

However, the absence of explicit local alignment objectives may limit the exploitation of fine-grained segmentation signals. The BYOL-style masked modeling with a full-view teacher is reasonable, but important implementation details are missing (e.g., projection/predictor heads, EMA rate), which significantly influence performance and stability.Converting bounding boxes to color-coded masks provides a simple path to harmonize modalities, but introducing fixed color encodings risks shortcut learning; masking/augmentation schemes for masks and analysis of color-coded bias would strengthen the approach.\n- Experimental evaluation assessmentThe breadth of downstream tasks is a strong point. Still, conclusions about superiority would be more convincing with standardized, controlled comparisons. BenchX highlights that protocol differences can invert method rankings; a MIMIC-only pretraining variant or reporting within BenchX would isolate methodological gains from data scale.The segmentation/detection improvements are promising, but without clearer architectural details (e.g., how ViT acts as a YOLO backbone) and stronger segmentation supervision (e.g., leveraging CheXmask or other pixel-level resources), it is hard to credit the improvements specifically to segmentation-aware pretraining rather than general large-scale pretraining and the mixed-view objectives.The ablations on supervision mixtures are informative but confounded by disparate sample sizes; a controlled ablation with matched sample counts per supervision type (or up/downsampling to equalize) would better support the “synergy” claim.Zero-shot classification and VQA improvements are modest but consistent; please report prompt templates and calibration protocols for zero-shot to ensure reproducibility and fair comparisons.\n- Comparison with related work (using the summaries provided)IMITATE introduces hierarchical text–vision alignment and a clinical-informed contrastive loss to avoid hard negatives among semantically similar cases; UmiF could benefit from similar “soft target” ideas to better handle near-duplicate or synonym-rich labels and cross-dataset concept drift.CXR-CLIP uses multi-view and modality-specific contrastive terms (image–image and text–text) to strengthen study-level invariance; UmiF’s token grouping could incorporate intra-modality contrastive terms as additional regularizers.MedFLIP integrates MAE-style masking in VLP and uses SVD-based alignment; UmiF’s masked modeling via BYOL might be complemented with structured alignment losses or entity-aware supervision to bolster VL grounding.DeViDe shows substantial zero-shot gains through knowledge augmentation and multi-granularity alignment; while UmiF aims to be task-agnostic, considering patch–text local alignment for improved grounding could further enhance fine-grained performance.IRENE/MDT demonstrates unified token processing for heterogeneous clinical data with explicit bi-directional cross-attention; UmiF’s single-backbone approach is conceptually similar but lacks explicit cross-attention blocks or analyses that show token-level fusion quality. Discussing such architectural trade-offs would clarify the unique contribution of the flexible grouping mechanism.BenchX underscores the necessity of standardized pretraining/evaluation to fairly compare MedVLP methods; including a MIMIC-only pretraining comparison or reporting within BenchX would substantially strengthen claims of SOTA.\n- Discussion of broader impact and significanceUnifying diverse medical supervisions within a single, extensible framework is impactful, especially for medical domains where annotations are heterogeneous and sparse. If models and code are released, UmiF could serve as a common foundation for diverse downstream tasks, reducing the proliferation of task-specific pretraining schemes. Ethical considerations around synthetic text generation (e.g., GPT-4 generated reports) and potential biases introduced by multi-institutional data mixing should be further detailed, including procedures to avoid test-set leakage and to handle multilingual consistency.\n\nTechnical soundness evaluation\n\n- The unified tokenization and single-backbone design is sound and aligns with generalist transformer directions (OFA, BEiT-3, Painter), and the token grouping mechanism is a neat way to span discrete supervision regimes with one knob r.

Are there projection/predictor heads before computing similarities, and if so, what are their architectures?\n- What are the momentum, predictor, and projection head details for the BYOL teacher–student setup? Is there stop-gradient on the teacher, and what EMA decay is used?\n- How is the ViT backbone adapted for YOLOv3 in the detection experiments? Please detail the feature map conversion, strides, and any added necks/heads to ensure reproducibility and fair comparisons.\n- Did you ensure that downstream test images (e.g., RSNA, SIIM) were excluded from the pretraining corpus? Please describe the de-duplication and patient-level filtering protocols to avoid leakage.\n- For datasets where you generated synthetic reports from class labels or used GPT-4 translations/polishing, what prompts and quality controls were used? Do these synthetic texts risk overstating VL performance by injecting near-deterministic label phrases?\n- Can you provide controlled ablations where each supervision type (report/caption/class/segment) is matched for sample count to isolate the effect of supervision diversity from dataset scale?\n- Why was segmentation supervision limited to ~2K samples? Have you considered incorporating large-scale pseudo-segmentation resources (e.g., CheXmask) to better assess the patch-level benefits of your framework?\n- Could you evaluate UmiF in a standardized setting (e.g., MIMIC-only pretraining as in BenchX) to disentangle corpus-scale effects from methodological gains?\n\n### Overall Assessment\n\nThis paper tackles an important and challenging problem—unifying heterogeneous medical supervision sources in a single pretraining framework—and presents an intuitively appealing approach via a unified token space and a flexible token grouping mechanism that subsumes cross-modal contrast and masked modeling. The breadth of downstream evaluations and generally strong performance are compelling, and the framework appears extensible. However, the empirical validation falls short of fully supporting the strongest claims: comparisons are not controlled for pretraining corpus size/heterogeneity, some implementation details critical for reproducibility and interpretation are missing, and several ablations are confounded by large disparities in supervision sample sizes. Strengthening fairness and clarity—through standardized pretraining comparisons (e.g., MIMIC-only/BenchX), more rigorous ablations (balanced supervision subsets, broader token-grouping analyses), and fuller methodological detail—would make the contribution more robust for a top-tier venue. Overall, the idea is promising and of high potential value to the community; with the suggested additions and clarifications, the work could be a strong candidate for publication.",

All modalities are transformed into a shared token space, allowing contrastive and masked modeling through a single ViT backbone. Pre-trained on 1.66M image-language pairs across 14 datasets, the framework demonstrates strong performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, including classification, segmentation, detection, zero-shot transfer, retrieval, and VQA. The paper is clearly organized, with sound motivation for unifying heterogeneous supervisions, and presents its conceptual design and experiments coherently.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**\n\n1. **Technical soundness and novelty**  \n   - The unified tokenization and single-backbone setup is technically sound and aligns with recent generalist transformer approaches. However, the omission of local alignment objectives (e.g., patch–token grounding) limits exploitation of fine-grained segmentation signals.  \n   - While the token grouping mechanism elegantly interpolates supervision regimes, important implementation details (projection heads, momentum, EMA) are absent, affecting reproducibility.  \n   - The use of RGB segmentation masks may introduce color priors rather than spatial understanding.\n\n2. **Experimental design and fairness**  \n   - Comparisons are not strictly controlled: UmiF pretrains on larger and more heterogeneous data than baseline methods, limiting claims of superiority.  \n   - The ablations on supervision mixtures and grouping are informative but confounded by differing data scales; balanced-sample experiments would better assess “synergy” effects.  \n   - Details are missing on how the ViT backbone integrates with YOLOv3 for detection, leaving reproducibility gaps.\n\n3. **Relation to prior work**  \n   - The discussion omits several closely related unified or multimodal frameworks (e.g., IMITATE, CXR-CLIP, MedFLIP, DeViDe, BenchX, MDT/IRENE). Adding such comparisons, ideally under standardized protocols, would strengthen positioning and clarify distinct contributions.\n\n4. **Broader impact and ethical aspects**  \n   - The unification approach is well-motivated for the medical domain but would benefit from discussion of potential biases in synthetic or multilingual data, test set leakage safeguards, and governance of mixed-institution datasets.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**\n\n- Clarify notation in the contrastive loss: confirm that positives come from the same pair (i = j).  \n- Specify architectural and training details for the BYOL teacher–student setup (momentum, projection/predictor heads, stop-gradient policy).  \n- The sampling description (balanced vs. proportional to dataset size) is inconsistent.  \n- Report prompt templates and calibration protocols for zero-shot evaluation.  \n- Minor editorial clarifications on figure labels and dataset references would improve readability.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nOverall, UmiF provides a conceptually unified framework with notable breadth in experimental evaluation and convincing potential for broad application across medical imaging tasks. The approach’s strength lies in its generality and elegant integration of heterogeneous supervision. However, several claims are weakened by limited ablation control, absent technical details, and lack of standardized comparisons to contemporary baselines. Addressing experimental fairness and transparency, along with discussion of related multimodal pretraining efforts, would substantially reinforce the work’s rigor and reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**  \nThe paper presents an innovative and promising direction but requires more controlled experiments, methodological clarification, and contextual grounding to justify its strong performance claims and ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "# IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging Review Report\n\n## 1. Opening Paragraph\n\nThis paper addresses the critical challenge of pre-training medical image encoders to provide robust, task-agnostic representations that can enhance understanding of medical images and support diverse downstream analysis tasks with limited data. Current pre-training methods fail to integrate various types of supervisions (including self-supervision and external supervision like segmentation annotations, reports, and classification labels) that collectively could significantly improve medical image understanding. The authors propose UmiF (Unified medical image pre-training framework), a novel approach that unifies all common supervision types through a unified token space and flexible token grouping strategy. The framework processes diverse inputs (image-report, image-caption, image-class, and image-segment pairs) by converting them into token embeddings and randomly splitting tokens into groups for contrastive learning and mask modeling. Pre-trained on an unprecedented scale of 1.66M samples from 14 public datasets, UmiF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, retrieval, and visual question answering, showing significant improvements over existing methods by leveraging the synergistic effects of heterogeneous supervision signals.\n\n## 2. Major and Minor Comments\n\n### Major Strengths:\n- The paper presents a truly unified framework that can effectively integrate all common supervision types (self-supervision, language, and segmentation) through a cohesive approach rather than specialized designs for each data type\n- The large-scale pre-training dataset (1.66M samples from 14 public datasets) significantly surpasses previous efforts and provides a valuable resource for the community\n- The flexible token grouping strategy is innovative and effectively enables diverse learning tasks from a unified framework\n- Comprehensive evaluation across multiple downstream tasks with thorough ablation studies demonstrates the framework's versatility\n- The work addresses a critical need in medical imaging where diverse annotation types exist but are rarely leveraged together\n\n### Major Limitations:\n- The framework is only validated on chest X-ray images without discussion of how it might generalize to other medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT)\n- Limited discussion of computational requirements (training time, memory usage, inference speed) which is critical for clinical deployment\n- Insufficient exploration of clinical applicability and how the framework could be integrated into real-world clinical workflows\n- No analysis of performance variations across different disease categories or severity levels, which is clinically relevant\n- The paper doesn't sufficiently address potential limitations in low-resource settings or how the approach might handle noisy annotations\n\n### Minor Strengths:\n- Clear and well-designed figures that effectively illustrate the framework architecture and data processing\n- Thorough ablation studies on the flexible token grouping strategy that provide valuable insights\n- Good documentation of dataset processing and standardization procedures\n- The release of code and model checkpoints enhances reproducibility and community impact\n\n### Minor Limitations:\n- Some technical sections (particularly Section 3) could be made more accessible to non-expert readers\n- The abstract could be more concise while preserving key methodological details\n- Limited discussion about the optimal ratio of different supervision types in the pre-training data\n- Figure captions could be more descriptive to help readers interpret visual elements without constant reference to the main text\n\n## 3. Evaluation Summary\n\n**Significance**: The work addresses a highly significant problem in medical imaging AI - the inability of current pre-training methods to integrate diverse supervision signals. By unifying various supervision types into one framework, UmiF can leverage the complementary strengths of different annotation types, which is particularly valuable in medical domains where data is scarce but diverse annotations exist. This approach has potential to substantially improve the performance of medical AI systems across numerous applications.\n\n**Innovation**: The paper demonstrates high innovation through its unified framework that processes all common supervision types through a single scalable approach. The flexible token grouping strategy is particularly novel, enabling the same architecture to handle diverse learning tasks without modality-specific designs. The conceptual advance of treating all supervisions as token embeddings in a unified space represents a significant departure from previous medical pre-training methods that were limited to specific supervision types.\n\n**Evaluation**: The evaluation is comprehensive and rigorous, with state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks (classification, segmentation, detection, VQA). The ablation studies on the flexible grouping strategy provide valuable insights into the framework's design choices. However, additional analysis of failure cases, performance across different disease categories, and computational requirements would strengthen the evaluation further.\n\n**Reproducibility**: The paper scores highly on reproducibility with detailed descriptions of dataset processing, pre-training configuration, and model architecture. The authors provide thorough documentation of their data processing pipeline and plan to release code and model checkpoints. The framework design is clearly explained, and the use of public datasets ensures others can replicate the results.\n\n## 4. Decision Recommendation\n\n**Major Revision**\n\nThis paper presents a valuable contribution to medical imaging AI with its unified pre-training framework that can leverage diverse supervision signals. The strengths are substantial: novel approach, comprehensive evaluation, large-scale dataset, and strong results across multiple tasks. However, several limitations need to be addressed before acceptance:\n\n1. The authors should expand their discussion of how UmiF might generalize to other medical imaging modalities beyond chest X-rays\n2. Computational requirements analysis should be added to assess practical deployment feasibility\n3. The clinical applicability section should be expanded to discuss potential integration into clinical workflows\n4. Additional analysis of performance across different disease categories and severity levels would strengthen the clinical relevance\n5. The presentation should be made more accessible to a broader medical imaging audience\n\nWith these revisions, this paper has the potential to become an important contribution to the field of medical imaging AI, addressing a critical need for unified pre-training frameworks that can leverage the diverse annotations available in medical datasets.",

        "text": "## A summary of the paper  \n\nThe manuscript tackles the challenge of building task‑agnostic encoders for medical imaging by introducing a unified pre‑training framework that can exploit a wide variety of supervisory signals. These signals include self‑supervision, paired radiology reports, image captions, classification labels, and segmentation masks. The authors pre‑train on a massive corpus of 1.66 million images drawn from 14 publicly available chest‑X‑ray collections, covering image‑report, image‑caption, image‑class, and image‑segment pairings. All inputs are transformed into a common token embedding space using modality‑specific tokenizers. A flexible token‑grouping strategy then creates two complementary token groups that serve both as positive pairs for contrastive learning and as incomplete views for mask‑modeling, all processed by a single Vision Transformer backbone. The resulting encoder is evaluated on several downstream tasks—linear classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, zero‑shot classification, and visual‑question‑answering—with performance reported across the board. The principal contributions are (i) the token‑based unified framework, (ii) the large‑scale multi‑supervision pre‑training, and (iii) the public release of the pretrained encoder.\n\n---\n\n## General feedback  \n\n- **Significance:** Bringing heterogeneous medical annotations together in a single pre‑training pipeline addresses a genuine bottleneck in the field, where many public datasets are small and fragmented.  \n- **Innovation:** The proposed “unified token space” and the “flexible token‑grouping” mechanisms are conceptually straightforward yet novel for medical imaging. While reminiscent of multimodal contrastive and MAE approaches (e.g., CLIP, MAE), the manuscript would benefit from a clearer articulation of the specific advantages over those existing baselines.  \n- **Evaluation:** The authors present an extensive suite of downstream experiments, and UmiF often surpasses prior methods (see Tables 2–5). However, the experimental description lacks details on dataset splits, statistical significance testing, and a comprehensive set of baselines for detection and VQA.  \n- **Reproducibility:** Important training particulars—such as learning‑rate schedules, loss‑weighting, token‑grouping probability schedules, masking ratios, and random seeds—are omitted. Moreover, the code and model release is conditional on acceptance, which limits immediate verification.\n\n---\n\n## Specific comments / critiques  \n\n- **Token‑grouping hyper‑parameters:** The manuscript does not specify the probability of setting r = 1 nor the full distribution of r. Only a limited ablation (Table 6) with a 0.2 probability is shown, achieving the best RSNA 1 % classification AUC. A more thorough investigation, including possible annealing schedules, would strengthen the analysis.  \n- **Mask‑modeling details:** Equation (2) introduces a BYOL‑style consistency loss, yet the paper omits crucial information such as mask size, the proportion of tokens masked, and the weighting of this loss relative to the contrastive alignment loss. Providing these details is essential for reproducibility (Section 3.3).  \n- **Segmentation tokenization and contribution:** Segmentation masks are treated as a third image modality (RGB masks → patches), but no ablation isolates the effect of this design choice. Table 7 mixes all supervision types without a “image + segmentation only” comparison, leaving the contribution of segmentation unclear.  \n- **Dataset documentation:** Table 1 contains placeholder entries, lacks clear column headings, and does not provide sample counts for several modalities or preprocessing specifics (resolution, normalization). This makes it difficult to assess the scale and diversity of the data.  \n- **Baseline fairness:** In Tables 2 and 3, comparisons combine CNN‑based and ViT‑based baselines that differ in model size and pre‑training data volume, potentially biasing the reported improvements. A controlled baseline—e.g., same ViT architecture and identical pre‑training data—would provide a fairer benchmark.  \n- **Zero‑shot protocol:** Table 4 reports AUC on CXP500 but does not describe how prompts are constructed, which text encoder is used, or how the results compare to recent CLIP‑style medical models such as MedCLIP, which achieve higher scores.  \n- **VQA evaluation methodology:** Table 5 presents accuracy without clarifying whether open‑ended answers are evaluated with exact match or a softer scoring scheme, nor does it detail the answer vocabulary or the fine‑tuning of the decoder.  \n- **Synthetic report quality:** The appendix outlines GPT‑4 prompts employed to translate Spanish reports and generate synthetic reports, yet no quantitative assessment of translation quality—or its impact on downstream performance—is provided.  \n- **Statistical reporting:** The manuscript lacks confidence intervals, standard deviations, or significance tests for any downstream metric (AUC, Dice, mAP), leaving the robustness of the reported gains uncertain.  \n- **Bias analysis:** While the ethics statement mentions potential regional bias due to reliance on public datasets, no empirical analysis (e.g., performance across institutions or imaging devices) is presented.\n\n---\n\n## A suggested decision  \n\n**Major Revision** – The work demonstrates considerable promise and addresses an important problem, but several substantive issues—particularly regarding methodological detail, baseline fairness, and reproducibility—must be resolved before the manuscript can be accepted.",
