    "abstract": "Breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM) affects women’s health globally, calling\n for the development of effective diagnosis and prognosis solutions. While deep\n learning has exhibited impressive capacities across various healthcare domains, its\n applicability in BCBM diseases is consistently hindered by the lack of an open,\n large-scale, deep learning-ready dataset. As such, we introduce the Bone Metastasis\n (BoneMet) dataset, the first large-scale, publicly available, high-resolution medical\n resource, which is derived from a well-accepted murine BCBM model. The unique\n advantage of BoneMet over existing human datasets is repeated sequential scans\n per subject over the entire disease development phases. The dataset consists of\n over 67 terabytes of multi-modal medical data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D\n CT scans, and detailed biological data (e.g., medical records and bone quantitative\n analysis), collected from more than five hundreds mice spanning from 2019 to\n 2024. Our BoneMet dataset is well-organized into six components, i.e., Rotation\nX-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec. We further\n show that BoneMet can be readily adopted to build versatile, large-scale AI models\n for managing BCBM diseases in terms of diagnosis using 2D or 3D images, prognosis of bone deterioration, and sparse-angle 3D reconstruction for safe long-term\n disease monitoring. Our preliminary results demonstrate that BoneMet has the\n potentials to jump-start the development and fine-tuning of AI-driven solutions\n prior to their applications to human patients. To facilitate its easy access and\n wide dissemination, we have created the BoneMet package, providing three APIs\n that enable researchers to (i) flexibly process and download the BoneMet data\n filtered by specific time frames; and (ii) develop and train large-scale AI models for\n precise BCBM diagnosis and prognosis. The BoneMet dataset is officially available on Hugging Face Datasets at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoneMet/BoneMet. The BoneMet package is available on the Python Package Index (PyPI) at https://pypi.org/project/BoneMet. Code and tutorials are available at https://github.com/Tiankuo528/BoneMet.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a novel large-scale dataset (named BoneMet) of Breast tumor bone metastasis for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment management. It consists of six components: Rotational X-Ray Imagery, Reconstructed CT Imagery, Segmented CT Imagery, Registered CT Imagery, Region of Interest CT Imagery, and Mice Medical Records. Besides, the author conducted a series of experiments on the BoneMet dataset by developing various deep learning models to exhibit its applicability and efficiency in managing BTBM disease. The enormous open-source dataset has significant implications for the development of new algorithms in this field beyond doubt.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n(1) The motivation of this study is clear and the background is well presented in the manuscript.\nThe main contribution of this work is to release a large-scale breast tumor bone metastasis dataset BoneMet, for the research community. Upon the subsets of the BoneMet, the researchers are allowed to develop some novel approaches to solve the task of breast tumor bone metastasis diagnosis and prognosis, and thus facilitating the automated analysis for breast tumor bone metastasis.\n(2) Apart from the information of the collected dataset, the authors also developed several deep learning models to validate the applicability and efficacy of BoneMet.\n(3) Dataset, code and tutorials are made available for free use.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n(1) The technical contributions of this study are quite marginal, as most of the deep learning models are built upon existing methods.\n(2) Some details about the dataset preparation and experiments are missing.\n(3) Some settings and analyses in the experiment may not support the objectives.\n(4) The quality of the labels, particularly the pixel-wise annotation of the bone, might be questionable.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Authors describe that Seg-CT and Recon-CT are independent. What is the difference between 3D CT scans in Recon-CT and Seg-CT? What is the meaning of the adjective 'segmented'?\n2. Line 341 \"Second, we observe a significant training-test accuracy gap of 20.4% with ViT (w/o STA), indicating a pronounced overfitting issue inherent to the ViT architecture.\"\nI think ViT, as a visual backbone network, is less overfitting compared to other structures such as CNN. In addition, is the decrease in accuracy necessarily overfitting?\n3. Section 3.1, the purpose and analysis of experiments is confusing. Why comparing two ViT models could demonstrate the applicability of the Rotation-X-Ray dataset to manage BTBM disease? What is the relation between the effectiveness of\nSTA and the applicability of the Rotation-X-Ray dataset? All subsections 3.2-4 have similar questions.\n4. The experiment did not report data partitioning.\n5. Table 2 reported metrics on the training and testing data. Is there any evaluation/dev data?\n6. The experiment reported many indicator values, but their actual clinical significance has not been evaluated. For example, what are the Precision/Recall/F1-Score/Accuracy of clinical experts on the BTBM diagnosis? Besides, the 3D-GAN, T-VAE, and ST-VAE methods achieve SSIM values of 0.767, 0.817, and 0.860. So, what role can they play in clinical practice?\n7. The authors used many existing softwares as the processing tools to generate the sub-datasets of BoneMet. Please provide the corresponding reference and specify whether it is free of charge or not. Also, please accurately explain in which case the datasets are processed by the Seg-API, Regist-API and RoI-API that were developed by the authors.\n8. Are Pre-Op and Post-Op refer to pre-operation and post-operation? Please give the full spelling.\n9. For RoI-CT, the tibiae ROI is assigned with different pixel values. As shown in Figure 4, for each CT example, is the processed CT image contains the values of 180, 240, 60 and 0 only? If yes, the original CT turns to a segmentation mask instead, and lots of information would be lost.\n10. In the whole preparation procedure, it seems that the manual annotation of the organs or tumors is not involved, except for the manual cropping of fibular by  CTAn®. How could we ensure the effectiveness of the existing software?\n11. In Table 1, the column \"Spatial Resolution\" might be accurately filled out as most of them indicate the organs. Please revise it.\n12. Some details about the BoneMet dataset are missing. For instance, the number of mice is not introduced. Besides, in Table 1, the images/records are classified into two categories, i.e., positive and negative. Is the label assigned at the slice level or animal level? Besides, we noticed that the numbers of Seg-CT are larger than those of Recon-CT, which makes it confusing, as the Seg-CT is obtained from Recon-CT.\n13. I also have concerns about the MiceMediRec dataset. It mainly consists of the medical record and quantitative analysis results of 3D CT images, simulation and mechanical testing. The authors list only a part of the features in Table S2 in the supplementary file. However, all feature should be provided. The off-the-shelf software, such as CTAn®, was used to generate the quantitative parameters, which took about half an hour for each case of animal. In Section 3.3, the multi-modal prognostic assessment model first leveraged the GAN to produce the CT scan of the future point and use the quantitative data in the MiceMediRec dataset as the ground truth label to validate the predicted reaction force values. However, the details about how to obtain the predicted reaction force values are not clear.\n14. In my opinion, multi-modal learning might refer to a way to integrate the information of multi-source data to build a model. However, the application in Section 3.3 just used CT data as model input. Please consider revising it.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nThe authors have obtained ethical approval from their institution, and thus, so the ethics review is not needed.",

The creation of this open-source dataset holds significant promise for advancing research and algorithm development in the field.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. **Novelty and Depth**: The technical contributions are limited, as many deep learning models are based on existing methodologies rather than introducing new concepts.\n2. **Dataset Preparation and Experimentation**: Key details regarding dataset preparation and experimental setup are inadequate and require elaboration.\n3. **Relevance of Experiments**: Some experimental settings and analyses do not clearly align with the study’s objectives.\n4. **Label Quality Concerns**: The quality of pixel-wise annotations, particularly regarding bone labels, appears questionable.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- Clarify the differences between Seg-CT and Recon-CT. Define \"segmented\".\n- Address whether the observed accuracy gap with ViT indicates true overfitting.\n- Provide rationale for comparing two ViT models in terms of the dataset's applicability.\n- Data partitioning details were not mentioned.\n- Clarify the presence of evaluation data in the experimental metrics reported in Table 2.\n- Assess the clinical relevance of reported performance indicators compared to clinical expert benchmarks.\n- Provide references for software used in dataset processing, including details on cost and functionality.\n- Expand on the definitions of Pre-Op and Post-Op.\n- Confirm whether the pixel values in RoI-CT offer sufficient segmentation data without loss of information.\n- Justify the absence of manual annotation in the dataset preparation process.\n- Revise the \"Spatial Resolution\" in Table 1 for accuracy.\n- Include additional details on the BoneMet dataset, such as the number of mice involved and clarification of labeling at slice versus animal level.\n- Ensure comprehensive feature listings for the MiceMediRec dataset in supplementary materials.\n- Clarify the methodology behind predicting reaction force values using the GAN model.\n- Consider revisions to multi-modal learning definitions used in Section 3.3, as they appear limited.\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nIn evaluating the manuscript against TMI editorial criteria, the significance of the BoneMet dataset is evident, given its potential for impactful research in BTBM. The innovation is moderate, primarily due to the reliance on existing deep learning models. For evaluation, while the experimental design showcases various applications of the dataset, critical details are lacking, which affects reproducibility. Overall, the manuscript presents strengths in dataset contribution and accessibility while revealing weaknesses in methodological clarity and experimental validation.\n\n### Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision is recommended to address substantial concerns related to technical contributions and detail in the dataset and experimental framework.",

The authors further demonstrate the dataset’s applicability through multiple experimental deep learning models. Overall, the paper is clearly motivated and well organized, offering a valuable data resource, though the technical contributions and certain methodological details could be strengthened.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Technical Contribution:** The deep learning models mainly build upon existing architectures, resulting in limited methodological novelty.  \n2. **Dataset Clarity:** Key details regarding dataset preparation and processing are missing, including information on data partitioning, labeling strategy (slice vs. animal level), number of subjects, and label quality.  \n3. **Experimental Design:** The experimental setup and interpretation are sometimes unclear. The rationale linking specific model comparisons (e.g., ViT variants) to the stated objectives requires explanation; some analyses do not fully substantiate the conclusions.  \n4. **Annotation and Processing:** The pixel-wise label quality, especially for bone segmentation, is uncertain. It remains unclear how accurately automated tools perform without manual verification.  \n5. **Use of Software Tools:** The manuscript employs various existing tools (e.g., CTAn®, Seg-API, Regist-API, RoI-API) without fully specifying licensing, references, or usage contexts.  \n6. **Clinical Relevance:** Reported quantitative metrics (e.g., SSIM, F1, accuracy) lack comparison with clinical benchmarks, limiting interpretation of the dataset’s practical impact.  \n7. **MiceMediRec Module:** The structure, features, and ground-truth generation for this sub-dataset need clearer description—particularly the process for obtaining predicted and actual force values.  \n8. **Terminology and Concept Use:** Terms such as “multi-modal learning,” “segmented CT,” and “Pre-/Post-Op” require clearer definitions to avoid ambiguity.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify Table 1 entries, particularly “Spatial Resolution.”  \n- Confirm whether Seg-CT and Recon-CT images differ beyond segmentation masks.  \n- In Figure 4, specify pixel-value encoding for ROI-CT images.  \n- Review missing or incomplete references for software tools.  \n- Check typographical consistency and acronym definitions (e.g., STA).  \n\n**Summary Paragraph (TMI Editorial Criteria)**  \nThe dataset addresses a significant and underexplored clinical application, enhancing reproducibility and data accessibility for BTBM research. Its innovation lies primarily in dataset creation rather than modeling advances.

Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript clearly falls within the methodological scope of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI)*.  \nAlthough it primarily introduces a dataset rather than a new algorithmic framework, it directly supports medical imaging methodology by enabling development and benchmarking of imaging reconstruction, segmentation, registration, and prognosis models. The inclusion of multiple imaging modalities (2D X-ray, 3D CT) and temporal alignment further strengthens its relevance for imaging physics, reconstruction, and AI-based image analysis.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \n⚠️ Moderate. The work’s central novelty is the assembly and dissemination of an exceptionally large, multi-modal, longitudinal murine imaging dataset specialized for breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM). While the technical foundation (image acquisition and FBP-based CT reconstruction) is standard, the dataset’s scale, longitudinal structure, systematic processing, and accompanying APIs for segmentation, registration, and RoI cropping provide methodological value. However, most methodological demonstrations (e.g., ViT diagnosis, generative prognosis, sparse-angle reconstruction) reuse established algorithms to illustrate utility rather than introduce fundamentally new imaging methodology.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nHigh in data collection, moderate in validation. The paper meticulously documents imaging parameters, animal model design, sample numbers, temporal alignment, data organization, and preprocessing pipelines—indicating strong engineering and reproducibility standards. The demonstration studies show feasibility (diagnosis, prognosis, sparse reconstruction) but are limited in depth of experimental comparison and statistical evaluation. Metrics are provided, but details on error analysis, uncertainty, or generalization to human data are minimal.\n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nGenerally clear and well-structured; grammar and formatting are acceptable though inconsistent spacing, capitalization, and symbol rendering (e.g., “0°0.8°1.6°...”) and minor typographical errors recur. Figures are informative but sometimes heavily compressed. Section organization and dataset tables are comprehensive.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nStrong compliance. IACUC approval is explicitly stated with details on anesthesia, radiation dose, and humane animal treatment. Data is publicly released (Hugging Face, PyPI, GitHub), ensuring reproducibility and accessibility. Ethical data handling appears compliant with TMI standards.\n\n---\n\n## **Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n### **1. Summary**\nThe authors present **BoneMet**, a large-scale, longitudinal, multi-modal murine dataset designed for research on breast cancer bone metastasis. The dataset contains over **67 TB** of high-resolution rotational X-rays and 3D CT scans from **500+ mice** over five years, complemented by biological and mechanical metadata. Data are organized into six components (Rotation-X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec). The accompanying **BoneMet Python package** provides APIs for CT segmentation, registration, and region-of-interest cropping. Demonstration studies validate dataset usability in (i) X-ray/CT-based disease diagnosis, (ii) prognosis via 3D generative modeling and biomechanical simulation, and (iii) sparse-angle CT reconstruction using NeRF variants.\n\n### **2. Strengths**\n- **Significant dataset contribution:** First open, large-scale, longitudinal murine imaging database addressing a major gap in preclinical BCBM research.  \n- **Comprehensive documentation:** Detailed acquisition, reconstruction, labeling, and ethical compliance, promoting reproducibility.  \n- **Multi-modality & temporal richness:** Enables diverse imaging tasks including segmentation, registration, longitudinal progression modeling, and reconstruction.  \n- **Practical infrastructure:** Public dataset hosting, APIs, and tutorials lower access barriers for the imaging community.  \n- **Clinical and translational potential:** Provides a valuable foundation for deep-learning approaches in BCBM diagnosis and mechanical property prediction.\n\n### **3. Weaknesses**\n- **Limited methodological novelty:** The imaging pipeline primarily employs established methods (FBP, simple segmentation/registration), and the deep-learning models are off-the-shelf architectures used for illustration.  \n- **Insufficient methodological benchmarking:** Experimental sections demonstrate feasibility but lack comparison with alternative datasets or statistical robustness (error bars, uncertainty analysis).  \n- **Scope–fit risk:** As a dataset paper, the contribution may align better with *TMI’s Dataset and Benchmark Notes* if intended primarily as a resource rather than a methodological advance.  \n- **Presentation polish:** Occasional formatting, typographic inconsistencies, and figure readability issues.  \n- **Limited generalization evidence:** No demonstration on human data or cross-modality adaptation, leaving translational claims speculative.\n\n### **4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify methodological innovation:** Articulate explicitly how BoneMet advances medical imaging *methodology* rather than serving solely as a data resource (e.g., novel CT alignment pipeline, automated longitudinal registration protocols, or quantitative validation routines).  \n2. **Benchmarking and comparative analysis:** Provide systematic evaluations across algorithms, not just proof-of-concept. For instance, compare STA-ViT, CNN, and other temporal models statistically over multiple folds; quantify uncertainty across subjects.  \n3. **Dataset citation and maintenance:** Include DOIs, version control plans, and data access statements consistent with IEEE reproducibility guidelines.  \n4. **Broaden generalization discussion:** While murine data are preclinical, briefly assess representativeness and potential transfer to human imaging scenarios.  \n5. **Condense or restructure the manuscript:** Some content is descriptive (e.g., operational minutiae) and could move to supplementary material to emphasize scientific insights within main text.\n\n### **5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct spacing and capitalization in headings (e.g., “A N OPEN LARGE -SCALE MULTI -MODAL…”).  \n- Figures 1–4: improve font sizes and legends for readability.  \n- Provide consistent units (µm vs. micron, Gy vs. mGy).  \n- Ensure reference formatting conforms to IEEE style (e.g., numbered citations with bracketed numbers).  \n- Minor grammar issues (use “data are” instead of “data is”, etc.).  \n- Verify that “MMST-ViT,” “ST-VAE,” and other abbreviations are defined upon first use.\n\n### **6. Overall Recommendation**\n**Recommendation:** 🔸 *Reject (Out of Scope / Low Novelty for TMI)* *or* consider resubmission as a **“TMI Dataset or Resource Note”** if such track exists.  \n*Rationale:* Scientifically valuable and methodologically rigorous dataset, but limited novelty in imaging methodology relative to regular TMI research articles. The contribution is infrastructural rather than algorithmic.\n\nIf reoriented toward method development (e.g., automated registration toolkit or sparse-angle reconstruction algorithm with novel design and analytical validation), the paper could qualify for Major Revision consideration.\n\n### **7. Confidence Level:** 5/5  \nAssessment based on strong familiarity with medical imaging datasets, quantitative imaging, and deep-learning-based reconstruction methods.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** *BoneMet* represents a high–impact community resource with careful technical execution and strong potential to catalyze methodological advances. However, in its current form it is more a **dataset introduction paper** than a **methodological innovation manuscript**, placing it marginally below the typical novelty threshold for IEEE *Transactions on Medical Imaging*.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces BoneMet, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset for breast cancer bone metastasis (BCBM) diagnosis and prognosis derived from murine models. The dataset comprises 67 terabytes of data from over 500 mice collected between 2019-2024, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and medical records organized into six components: Rotation-X-Ray, Recon-CT, Seg-CT, Regist-CT, RoI-CT, and MiceMediRec (Section 2.1, Table 1). The authors demonstrate the dataset's applicability through experiments on BCBM diagnosis using Vision Transformers and CNNs, achieving accuracies ranging from 79.1% to 92.0% (Section 3.2-3.3), prognostic assessment of bone mechanical properties using generative models (Section 3.4), and sparse-angle CT reconstruction (Section 3.5). The dataset is publicly available through Hugging Face with accompanying APIs for image processing tasks.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Limited experimental validation scope**: The evaluation demonstrates basic feasibility but lacks comprehensive benchmarking against established methods or clinical relevance assessment. The experiments primarily show that existing models can achieve reasonable performance on the dataset rather than demonstrating significant advances in BCBM diagnosis. Standard accuracy metrics (Table 3, Figures 5a-5d) do not establish clinical utility or compare against radiologist performance, limiting impact assessment.\n\n• **Inadequate mathematical and technical rigor**: No mathematical formulations are provided for key processing steps, making reproducibility challenging. The segmentation threshold selection (75/255, Section 2.1, Page 4) lacks theoretical justification or validation studies. Registration methodology mentions mutual information maximization (Section A, Page 15) without presenting the optimization objective function or convergence criteria, hindering technical assessment and reproducibility.\n\n• **Questionable generalizability to human clinical applications**: The murine model limitations are acknowledged but insufficiently addressed regarding translation potential. Significant physiological differences between mice and humans (disease progression timescales of weeks vs. years, Section G, Page 20) raise concerns about clinical relevance. The animal-level labeling approach (Section 3, Page 6) differs substantially from typical clinical diagnostic scenarios where lesion-level or time-specific predictions are needed.\n\n• **Insufficient dataset quality assessment**: Missing critical analyses of data quality, annotation consistency, and potential biases. The 20.4% training-test accuracy gap with ViT (Table 3) suggests possible overfitting issues or data quality problems that remain unexplored. Inter-annotator agreement, segmentation accuracy validation, and systematic quality control measures are not reported (Section 2.1), raising concerns about dataset reliability.\n\n• **Methodological limitations in experimental design**: The experimental setup lacks statistical rigor and proper controls. Cross-validation is mentioned (Section 3.1) but detailed statistical analysis, confidence intervals, or significance testing are absent from results (Tables 3-5). Comparison baselines are limited, and the choice of evaluation metrics may not reflect clinical decision-making requirements, reducing the validity of performance claims.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Expand experimental validation comprehensively**: Conduct thorough benchmarking against state-of-the-art BCBM diagnosis methods and include radiologist performance comparisons. Evaluate clinical relevance through collaboration with medical professionals and assess diagnostic accuracy at clinically meaningful thresholds. Implement more diverse evaluation metrics including sensitivity/specificity analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves to better demonstrate clinical utility.\n\n• **Enhance mathematical formalization and technical documentation**: Provide complete mathematical formulations for all image processing steps, including segmentation algorithms, registration optimization objectives, and reconstruction methods. Justify threshold selection through systematic validation studies and present convergence criteria for iterative procedures. Include detailed algorithmic descriptions and parameter sensitivity analyses to ensure reproducibility and technical soundness.\n\n• **Address generalizability concerns systematically**: Conduct comprehensive analysis of murine-to-human translation challenges and provide validation strategies for clinical applications. Develop time-scale normalization approaches to bridge the temporal gap between mouse and human disease progression. Implement lesion-level labeling and evaluation protocols that better match clinical diagnostic scenarios and demonstrate translational potential through pilot human studies or existing human dataset comparisons.\n\n• **Implement rigorous dataset quality assessment**: Establish comprehensive quality control protocols including inter-annotator agreement studies, systematic bias analysis, and data consistency validation. Address overfitting concerns through detailed data quality investigation and implement cross-dataset validation approaches. Develop standardized annotation guidelines and provide quantitative quality metrics for all dataset components to ensure reliability and scientific rigor.\n\n• **Strengthen experimental methodology and statistical analysis**: Implement proper statistical testing frameworks with confidence intervals, significance tests, and multiple comparison corrections. Expand baseline comparisons to include more diverse and recent methods, and develop clinically-relevant evaluation protocols. Provide detailed cross-validation results, learning curve analyses, and failure case studies to better characterize model performance and limitations across different scenarios.",

The dataset encompasses over 67 terabytes of data, including 2D X-ray images, 3D CT scans, and detailed biological records, collected from more than 500 mice over five years. The authors argue that this dataset can significantly advance the development and evaluation of AI models for BCBM diagnosis and prognosis. The manuscript is well-structured and clearly articulates the significance of the dataset in addressing the limitations of existing human datasets.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the BoneMet dataset is novel and addresses the scarcity of large-scale, high-resolution, multi-modal datasets for BCBM, the manuscript could benefit from a more thorough comparison with existing datasets, particularly those that also include longitudinal imaging and detailed biological data. This would help clarify how BoneMet uniquely contributes to the field beyond its scale and resolution.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation experiments are limited to a subset of deep learning models and do not extensively cover the breadth of potential applications mentioned. The manuscript should expand its experimental scope to include a wider range of deep learning architectures and tasks, such as sparse-angle CT reconstruction and generative modeling, to more comprehensively validate the dataset's utility.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares the BoneMet dataset with existing datasets but lacks a detailed discussion of how it performs relative to these datasets in terms of specific metrics and tasks. Including more comparative analyses would strengthen the argument for the dataset's superiority and utility.\n\n4. Reproducibility: While the BoneMet package and APIs are described, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed description of the preprocessing steps, hyperparameter settings, and data splitting strategies used in the experiments. Providing complete code and data processing pipelines would significantly enhance reproducibility.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity in Figures: Some figures, such as Figure 3, are cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions for better readability.\n   \n2. Notation Consistency: The notation for the forward operator is inconsistent in Section 2.1. Clarifying and standardizing the notation would improve the manuscript's clarity.\n\n3. Acronym Definitions: Several acronyms, such as \"R=4,\" are used without definition. Defining these acronyms would enhance the manuscript's accessibility.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical errors, such as \"k-spacce\" and \"undersampling maskes,\" should be corrected for better readability.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: the lack of large-scale, high-resolution, multi-modal datasets for BCBM diagnosis and prognosis. The BoneMet dataset is a substantial contribution to the field, offering high-resolution imaging data and detailed biological records from a murine model. The novelty and innovation of the dataset are clear, and the preliminary experimental results demonstrate its potential for advancing AI-driven solutions. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited in scope and could benefit from more comprehensive comparisons and a broader range of applications. The reproducibility of the dataset and experimental setup is generally good but could be further enhanced by providing more detailed methodological descriptions and complete codebases. Overall, the manuscript makes a strong case for the significance and potential impact of the BoneMet dataset, but the evaluation could be strengthened to fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, broaden the evaluation scope to cover a wider range of deep learning tasks, and provide more detailed methodological descriptions to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised anomaly detection using deep learning has garnered significant research attention due to its broad applicability, particularly in medical imaging where labeled anomalous data are scarce. While earlier approaches leverage generative models like autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs), they often fall short due to overgeneralization. Recent methods explore various strategies, including memory banks, normalizing flows, self-supervised learning, and knowledge distillation, to enhance discrimination. Among these, knowledge distillation, particularly reverse distillation, has shown promise. Following this paradigm, we propose a novel scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model that addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive student-teacher learning approach to derive more discriminative representations by generating and exploring out-of-normal distributions. Further, we design a scale adaptation mechanism to softly weight contrastive distillation losses at different scales to account for the scale variation issue. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe authors propose a new method for anomaly detection in medical data setting using contrastive reverse distillation. The method uses knowledge distillation as it's foundation, implementing pre-trained teachers models along with a student model trained to either minimize or maximize its distance from the teachers in a feature-map space. They additionally utilize a scale adaptive mechanism to allow for better generalizations across different sizes of anomaly.\n\nTheir method's specific construction utilizes two teacher models with the same weights, one \"bad\" and one \"good\". The good model is given benign images while the bad model is given images with synthetic anomalies. The student model is then trained to maximize its cosine similarity with the per-layer features of the good teacher while minimizing the cosine similarity with the bad teacher. At evaluation time anomaly scores are computed by comparing the scaled, per-layer feature spaces of the good teacher against those of the student. Inputs with high levels of dissimilarity between the good model and student are given high anomaly scores.\n\nTheir evaluation against prior work is very comprehensive, comparing against a total of 18 other detectors. They out perform all other detectors on all three datasets (lung, brain, and skin anomalies) in terms of their main metrics (AUC, F1, and Accuracy). The authors further perform ablations with respect to their main contributions of Contrastive Reverse Distilation and Scale Adaptive Mechanisms.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n* Anomaly detection is somewhat outside my area of expertise, but the paper seems to frame itself well within the current body of literature. \n* The paper is well written and easy to follow. Figures are also informative and easy to understand.\n* The idea of contrastive reverse distillation seems novel (to the best of my knowledge) and intuitive. I'd like to see how future works can iterate upon this framework in other settings or with improved constructions.\n* Motivation is well established for the usage synthetic anomalies, and the choice of simplex noise is clever.\n* Empirical analysis is very comprehensive in terms of datasets, baselines, and ablations.\n* The proposed method out-performs all baselines in terms of AUC, F1, and Accuracy.\n* The proposed method scales well with model architecture size, which is a good sign that the method is sensible.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nIn general, within my somewhat limited knowledge of this sub-field, I like this paper. In spite of that I think there are a few things the authors may want to consider to further strengthen their work.\n\nI think when discussing detection and AUC scores it is important to give them context within the given domain. See section B of [1] for some example discussion on this topic from a different field. I'd like the authors to consider the following questions:\n\n* Is it more important to maximize the true positive rate in spite of inducing some false positives? \n* Is it better to minimize false positives to increase confidence in the case of a positive prediction?\n* How do you anticipate doctors using these tools in their analysis?\n\nGiven this, it would also be nice if the authors could plot some of the ROCs between their method and some of the baselines (maybe including all of them is too visually messy, but at least the top 5). This way people can compare their method to the baselines at different levels of false positive rate.\n\nI think it would be good if the authors could include some extended discussion, either in the main body or the supplementary material, analyzing the more subtle features of their results. See the next section of my review \"Questions\" for some examples of what I think they can further analyze.\n\nLastly, the results of table 1 are good, but a bit overwhelming. I think it would help if the second best score in each metric is underlined and if the methods are visually grouped based on detector type (e.g. RD4AD, RD++, and ReContrast could be grouped together). Optionally it would be nice if all experiments were averaged over a few runs and given standard deviations or $\\pm$ scores, at least in the supplementary material. I understand if these experiments are too extensive to replicate too many times, though.\n\n [1] \"Membership Inference Attacks From First Principles\" https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03570\n\n### Questions\n\nHere I include some questions for the authors to consider.\n\n* Why does ISIC seem like the hardest dataset for all the detectors? Why is Brain Tumor the easiest?\n* Why is SAM more impactful in the Brain Tumor dataset while it seems minimally impactful in the RSNA dataset in table 2? Is this related at all to the results of table 3 - where Gaussian noise performs similar to simplex noise on RSNA, but much worse on Brain Tumor?\n* Can the method achieve better generalization by using a mixture of synthetic noise types, perhaps 10% gaussian, 90% simplex? \n* Can we improve performance by including some real world data in the training set, or will that harm generalization?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 3",

The approach builds upon knowledge distillation, employing two teacher models—one “good” trained on benign images and one “bad” using synthetic anomalies—and a student network optimized to align with the good teacher’s features while diverging from the bad one. A scale-adaptive mechanism further enhances generalization across anomaly sizes. The paper is clearly written, with informative figures and strong contextual integration within existing literature.

Additional experiments on combining synthetic noise types or introducing limited real data might shed light on generalization properties.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Ensure consistent formatting of tables and figures.  \n- Clarify the role of simplex vs. Gaussian noise in the ablation tables.  \n- Consider placing extended analysis or supplemental discussions in the appendix.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe work is significant in advancing anomaly detection techniques through a creative contrastive distillation setup, offering promising results across multiple modalities. Its innovation lies in the use of “good” and “bad” teacher networks and the scale-adaptive mechanism.

This work proposes two methods to address these issues: a contrastive student-teacher learning approach that involves using both a “good” and a “bad” teacher, as well as a scale adaptation mechanism. Results demonstrate that on almost every dataset the proposed approach is able to outperform existing techniques.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper is well written and the ideas are easy to follow. I appreciate how the authors identify the two problems facing medical imaging in this domain and then propose solutions. The new approach outperforms all other methods that the authors compare with in table 1.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nIssue 1: This paper doesn’t have any formal proofs or theorems to guarantee its effectiveness, therefore the strengths of the paper must rely on the experiments and empirical results. For the datasets I will admit as a review I am not very familiar with them. For example, on the image dataset CIFAR-10, a few years ago a jump from 93% to 98% was considered significant. Today an increase from 99% to 99.9% on CIFAR-10 would not even be considered a major contribution. Likewise, for these datasets it is hard to determine whether a jump of 3.01% and 4.38% (as the authors show) is worthy of publication. Could the authors please clarify how much other papers pushed the accuracy forward in other works, as compared to the increase their method is offering?\n\nIssue 2: The authors say they will release their code upon publication, but I did not see any code given in the supplemental material. This might be an oversight on my part, but where is the code? I would like to see a good faith gesture of releasing an anonymous github for the code or at least a zip file of the code. Too many papers claim SOTA results and never release code. In this day and age it is simply unacceptable to continue this trend. \n\nIssue 3: The authors also don’t mention anything about the runtime of their algorithm. How does the student-teacher setup and training time compare to other existing methods in the field? While this is not a HUGE concern, I think it would be good to have some discussion and analysis of this. For example could you show the training time complexity of your algorithm and the next two best methods in the field? Or even an experimental runtime of the training in seconds of your algorithm and the next two best methods? Without this I feel we don’t have the complete story when comparing methods. \n\nIssue 4: Please see my minor comments about uncited claims in the papers. For acceptance I would like to see citations for all the claims you have made. \n\nIssue 5: I don’t like the terminology “good” and “bad” teacher. It is very non-technical and hard to follow. Can you please change the terminology in your paper and name the teachers more appropriately? \n\nMinor Comments:\n\n=Line 36, “anomalous samples is often prohibitively expensive and time-consuming…” I believe this is correct but I want to see a citation to backup this claim?\n\n=Line 45, “they tend to generalize too well, thereby risking the reconstruction of abnormal regions.” Citation for this claim? \n\n=Table 1 has many entries that are unsorted (aside from the bolded number indicating the best method). It would be better if this table was sorted in order of increasing AUC for the methods.\n\n=Line 167 “Medical images typically exhibit a power law distribution of frequencies, with lower frequency components dominating the image content.” Please give a citation for this bold claim?\n\n### Questions\n\nQ1: Please address each of my issues 1-5. If they are adequately addressed I would be willing to increase my score for the paper accordingly.\n\nEDIT: The reviewers have address my concerns adequately. I have update the score of my review accordingly.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 3",

On the other hand, parameters are extracted at each layer to achieve multi-scale information fusion, enabling the model to better distinguish between positive and negative samples.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe methodology section of this paper is clearly written and well-presented.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. In terms of innovation, this article presents two components that are commonly seen in other works. A straightforward suggestion would be for the authors to explore a more adaptable data augmentation method to address the issue raised in “Question 1.”\n\n2. Regarding the writing, the **Introduction** section of this article is somewhat confusing. Firstly, the paragraphing is suboptimal. In the second paragraph of the introduction, the author discusses the shortcomings of anomaly detection models based on generation. The third paragraph explains existing work aimed at improving these models, followed by an exploration of the development of self-supervised learning. Although self-supervised learning indeed enriches unsupervised learning within deep learning, the third paragraph would be clearer if it unified these two parts, focusing on how self-supervised learning specifically addresses the issues raised in the second paragraph. Secondly, and more importantly, an excessive portion of the introduction is dedicated to discussing related work, lacking sufficient focus on the contributions of this paper. Maybe you could merging the discussion of existing work and self-supervised learning, followed by a clear transition to the paper's contributions. Additionally, you could recommend what key points about the paper's contributions should be emphasized earlier in the introduction.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In the noise generation process, the intensity of each position is sampled from a uniform distribution. However, in real-world medical imaging, anomalous regions in disease cases appear in specific locations; for example, abnormalities in a chest image typically do not appear outside body regions. For instance, you could suggest incorporating prior knowledge about typical anomaly locations in different types of medical images.\n\n2. Additionally, is each test sample measured at the image level or at the patch level? If it is at the image level, the positive-to-negative anomaly ratio in the dataset is relatively high, which does not quite align with the extremely imbalanced nature of anomaly detection tasks.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 3",

The innovation is methodological rather than clinical—it involves a new training paradigm combining contrastive learning and knowledge distillation with scale adaptation. This fits well within IEEE TMI’s scope in machine learning methodology and image analysis for medical imaging.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level – Moderate to High**  \n   The work extends the reverse distillation concept with two methodological contributions: (1) a *contrastive student–teacher learning* mechanism that enhances representation discrimination through synthesized pseudo‑abnormal data, and (2) a *scale‑adaptation module* that dynamically weights multi‑scale distillation losses. Prior art (RD4AD, RD++, ReContrast) did not combine these aspects.

Summary\nThe manuscript proposes a *Scale‑Aware Contrastive Reverse Distillation (SACRD)* approach for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical images. Building on reverse distillation frameworks, the authors introduce (i) a contrastive student–teacher learning strategy that leverages a pair of “clean” and “noisy” teachers to encourage discriminative representations, and (ii) a scale‑adaptation module that dynamically weights loss contributions across feature scales. Synthetic anomalies are generated using *simplex noise* to produce structured perturbations. Evaluated on RSNA chest X‑rays, a brain‑tumor MRI dataset, and the ISIC 2018 dermoscopy dataset, the proposed method achieves state‑of‑the‑art AUC, F1, and accuracy compared with 15+ recent baselines.\n\n### 2. Strengths\n- **Methodological innovation:** Combines contrastive and reverse‑distillation paradigms with scale weighting—an elegant enhancement addressing feature discriminability and scale variation.  \n- **Comprehensive experimentation:** Multiple datasets, ablation studies (contrastive loss, SAM module, noise type and intensity, backbone).  \n- **Strong results:** Reported AUC improvements of 3–4 % vs. best baselines and clear qualitative separation of normal vs. abnormal distributions.  \n- **Good reproducibility:** Public code, detailed architecture, and pseudo‑code.  \n- **Generalizability:** Demonstrated across modalities, reinforcing potential broad utility.  \n\n### 3. Weaknesses\n- **Incremental nature:** Builds directly upon RD4AD/RD++ with architectural tweaks rather than a fundamentally new learning principle; may be near TMI’s lower novelty bound.  \n- **Synthetic anomaly realism:** Simplex noise is a convenient proxy but lacks clinical plausibility; justification or qualitative examples of realism would strengthen claims.  \n- **Statistical validation:** No confidence intervals or significance analyses on AUC differences.  \n- **Limited discussion of failure cases:** Insight into missed anomalies or false‑positives is absent.  \n- **Figure/formatting issues:** Some blurry figures and inconsistent typography.  \n\n### 4. Major Comments\n1. **Novelty positioning:** Clearly delineate conceptual differences from RD++ and ReContrast in the Introduction and Discussion, ideally through a table or schematic emphasizing algorithmic and loss‑function differences rather than implementation details.  \n2. **Statistical analysis:** Include significance testing (e.g., DeLong test) or bootstrapped confidence intervals for AUC to demonstrate robustness of reported improvements.  \n3. **Synthetic anomaly justification:** Provide qualitative comparison of simplex‑noise anomalies versus realistic pathologies; discuss limitations regarding anatomical plausibility.  \n4. **Failure case analysis:** Present sample anomaly maps illustrating false detections or missed lesions to help readers understand boundary conditions of the model.  \n5. **Clinical interpretability:** Comment on how contrastive and scale‑aware representations might translate to localizing pathology or assisting clinician trust.  \n\n### 5. Minor Comments\n- Correct text artifacts and spacing (e.g., “f eature d iscriminability”).  \n- Improve figure legends and resolution.  \n- Standardize abbreviations (e.g., SAM vs. S.A.M.).  \n- Provide exact runtime environment in reproducibility statement (CUDA/cuDNN versions).  \n- Ensure that all referenced works have full bibliographic information (some abbreviations inconsistent).  \n\n### 6. Overall Recommendation  \n**Recommendation:** **Major Revision**  \n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe paper demonstrates strong technical execution and promising performance but remains a methodological refinement over existing reverse‑distillation models rather than a fundamentally novel concept. With clearer differentiation from prior art, additional statistical support, and expanded discussion of synthetic‑anomaly validity, it could reach TMI’s publishable standard.\n\n### 7. Confidence Level  \n**4 / 5 – High Confidence**  \nBased on familiarity with reverse‑distillation anomaly detection literature and medical imaging machine‑learning methods.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nA rigorous and well‑executed study presenting an incremental yet meaningful enhancement to unsupervised anomaly detection.

A scale adaptation mechanism generates input-specific weights to handle multi-scale anomalies (Equation 3-4). The method is evaluated on three medical datasets (RSNA, Brain Tumor, ISIC) and achieves state-of-the-art performance, with AUC improvements of 3.01%, 4.38%, and 3.08% respectively over second-best methods (Table 1).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and unclear notation**\n  - Equation 2 presents a ratio-based loss without theoretical justification for why this specific formulation enhances discrimination compared to additive or weighted alternatives\n  - The reshaping operation mentioned in Section 2.2.1 for converting uk and vk to 1D representations lacks mathematical specification of dimensions and aggregation method\n  -

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces a scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation (CRD) model for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging. The proposed approach addresses two key limitations of existing reverse distillation methods: insufficient feature discriminability and inability to handle anomaly scale variations. The authors augment a reverse distillation framework with a contrastive student-teacher learning method and a scale adaptation mechanism, which they claim enhances the model's ability to discriminate between normal and abnormal images. The manuscript evaluates the proposed method on three benchmark datasets (RSNA Pneumonia Detection, Brain Tumor MRI, and ISIC 2018), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The work is well-written, and the motivation for integrating contrastive learning and scale adaptation is clearly articulated.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the introduction of a scale adaptation mechanism and contrastive learning within the reverse distillation framework is innovative, the manuscript needs to more clearly distinguish itself from recent related works. Specifically, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison with RD++ (Tien et al., 2023) and other contemporary methods that also address scale variations and contrastive learning. The novelty of the proposed method is somewhat undermined by the lack of explicit differentiation from these related works.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experimental evaluation is conducted on three benchmark datasets, which is commendable. However, the datasets are relatively standard and may not fully capture the complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. Including additional datasets or real-world clinical data could strengthen the validation of the proposed method. Additionally, the authors should consider evaluating their method on more diverse medical imaging modalities beyond X-ray, MRI, and dermoscopy to demonstrate its generalizability.\n\n3. Comparisons: The comparisons include a wide array of methods, which is appreciated. However, the inclusion of some less-recent methods (e.g., early autoencoder-based approaches) may not provide a fair assessment of the proposed method's advancement. Including more recent state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging would be beneficial.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors state that code will be made available, which is a positive step towards reproducibility. However, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of some key implementation details, such as specific hyperparameters, data preprocessing steps, and training protocols. Providing a more thorough description of these aspects would greatly enhance the reproducibility of the work.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Some figures (e.g., Figure 2) are cluttered and could benefit from clearer labeling and organization. Zooming in on specific regions or showing fewer representative slices would improve readability.\n\n2. Notation and Terminology: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is inconsistent in places, particularly regarding the forward operator. Clarification and standardization of this notation would improve clarity.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"AUC\", \"F1\") are used without initial definition, which could be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the terminology. Defining these acronyms when they are first introduced would be helpful.\n\n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors are present throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). Careful proofreading would address these issues.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in unsupervised anomaly detection in medical imaging, where labeled anomalous data are scarce. The proposed scale-aware contrastive reverse distillation model offers a technically interesting approach to enhance feature discriminability and handle scale variations. However, the novelty of the method is somewhat diminished by the lack of clear differentiation from related works. The evaluation, while comprehensive, could benefit from additional datasets and more recent comparative methods. The reproducibility of the approach is partially addressed, but more detailed implementation details are required. Overall, while the proposed method shows promise, the current evidence does not fully meet the rigorous standards expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand their comparative analysis to include more recent and relevant methods, strengthen the validation across more diverse datasets and modalities, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

We address this by creating a representation learning method that instead anticipates strong domain shifts at training time itself. We first propose a data engine that synthesizes highly variable training samples that would enable generalization to new biomedical contexts. To then train a single 3D network for any voxel-level task, we develop a contrastive learning method that pretrains the network to be stable against nuisance imaging variation simulated by the data engine, a key inductive bias for generalization. This network's features can be used as robust representations of input images for downstream tasks and its weights provide a strong, _dataset-agnostic_ initialization for finetuning on new datasets. As a result, we set new standards across _both_ multimodality registration and few-shot segmentation, a first for any 3D biomedical vision model, all without (pre-)training on any existing dataset of real images.",

The proposed pre-training strategy has 3 main steps: 1) Given a large datasets of 104 annotated organs, randomly sample anatomies, deform them and create a volume by ensembling these anatomies, 2) add noise and other augmentations to the volumes that are sampled in the previous step to simulate realistic looking synthetic medical images from labels, 3) train a U-Net with a contrastive objective by sampling two volumes that share the same 3D semantic layout but differ in appearance, treating corresponding features at different encoder levels as positives and all others as negatives. The pre-trained backbone is validated on two different tasks: 3D registration and 3D few-shot segmentation; using multiple datasets.  The results show the effectiveness of the proposed backbone in the experiments compared to existing methods.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Foundational models are showing promising performance lately; however, we lack of a 3D model that work across different modalities in medical imaging. The paper proposes a solution to this important problem using domain randomisation and contrastive learning.\n- The paper contain experiments on multiple datasets both for registration and few shot segmentation, and the results demonstrate the potential of the method.\n- The idea of combining the ideas of domain randomisation and local contrastive learning to train a generic 3D backbone is quite interesting and, to my knowledge, is novel.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- One issue I see in the paper is the convoluted description of the data engine step, especially the part creating the label ensemble model in section 3. I understand that this step is mainly based on the domain randomisation idea proposed in the literature. However, it is not really clear to me the steps between 201-207, especially the parts multiplying the masks with a randomly deformed sphere and randomly encasing half of the foreground-masked volumes.\n\n- The images generated in the data engine step do not seem like as real medical images. Do they look like this because the deformation is too large? It is not clear why one would prefer training the model using such unrealistic images.\n\n- The paper does not discuss the recent foundational models that show better generalization performance on many medical image datasets [1]. The downstream task performance of the representations obtained from the proposed backbone should be compared with the those obtained by the representations of a foundational model (e.g. DinoV2 [2]). For example, [3] is a recent paper that uses DinoV2 features for registration; but the same applies for the segmentation experiments. One can use the DinoV2 features for segmentation.\n\n[1] Cekmeceli et al. \"Do Vision Foundation Models Enhance Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation?\"\n[2] Oquab et al. \"DINOv2: Learning Robust Visual Features without Supervision\"\n[3] Song et al. \"DINO-Reg: General Purpose Image Encoder for Training-Free Multi-modal Deformable Medical Image Registration\"\n\n### Questions\n\n1- What are the exact steps of the \"label ensemble model\" described in Section 3? Please write elaborate description of these steps.\n2- Why do the generated images not look like real medical images? Is it because the deformation is too large? Why such \"unrealistic\" looking images are preferred rather than more realistic ones obtained with smaller deformation?\n3- How does the quality of the representations obtained by the proposed backbone compares with SoTA foundational models such as DinoV2 or SAM2?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The method involves generating synthetic medical images through a three-step process that includes anatomical sampling, noise addition, and training a U-Net with a contrastive objective. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through experiments in 3D registration and 3D few-shot segmentation on multiple datasets, indicating promising results in comparison to existing methods.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. The description of the data engine, particularly the creation of the label ensemble model in Section 3, is convoluted and lacks clarity, especially the steps between lines 201-207 involving mask multiplication with randomly deformed spheres.\n2. The synthetic images generated appear unrealistic as medical images. Clarification is needed regarding why such images are preferred over more realistic representations that could be achieved through smaller deformations.\n3. The manuscript does not address recent advancements in foundational models that exhibit superior generalization on many medical imaging tasks. A comparative analysis of the proposed backbone's performance against established models like DinoV2 is crucial.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- The manuscript could enhance clarity by providing a more detailed explanation of the \"label ensemble model\" within Section 3.\n- Consider refining the language used to describe the image generation process to aid understanding.\n- Review the comparison between the proposed method and current foundational models for improved comprehensiveness.\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nIn terms of significance, the manuscript addresses a critical need for a robust 3D model across various modalities in medical imaging, demonstrating innovation through its combination of domain randomization and contrastive learning techniques. However, the clarity of the evaluation design is compromised by convoluted descriptions, particularly within the data engine section, and the unrealistic nature of synthetic images raises concerns regarding reproducibility.

The authors propose to learn appearance invariance and shapes of human anatomy through synthetic dense pixel volumes. In this process, 3D volumes are synthesized by randomly recomposing 3D anatomical shapes and assigning multiple sets of random pixel values, in together with synthetic noises and deformations. Pairs of synthetic volumes are used for multi-scale contrastive learning. The proposed approach demonstrates improved image registration and low-shot image segmentation results compared to some previous works. Detailed ablation studies on the pre-training configurations toward downstream performances are conducted.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe overall methodology is straightforward and easy to understand. It echoes with the classical computer vision concept of invariance learning in the deep neural network era (although learned through a data-driven approach).\n\nImproved image registration results on two public image registration benchmarks and image segmentation performance on six image segmentation datasets are shown, compared to those of some existing works. \n\nThe paper is well-written with sufficient clarity. The illustrations are self-explanatory. Readers will enjoy reading it.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nTechnical novelty: The core idea behind the approach is to leverage data-driven approach to learn invariance to pixel values through paired synthetic shapes and different pixel values, and to learn semantic-independent shape representation through random geometric (real-world and pure synthetic) shapes – both key ideas come from the well-established SynthMorph (random Ising shapes with random intensity + synthetic deformation for training registration networks. Hoffmann et al.) and SynthSeg (GMM-like pixel value model for repainting brain structures. Billot et al.) Despite leveraging more anatomical shapes beyond brain structures and applied to a contrastive framework, the essence remains unchanged.  \n\nMany medical decisions are made not only on shape but also on subtle textures, for example, differentiating subtypes of tumors/lesions – toward which the proposed over-simplified appearance model by nature falls short. More sophisticated texture models need to be carefully studied beyond this manuscript.\n\nFor the same reason, high-level global semantic information such as relative locations between anatomical structures cannot be learned due to the nature of this approach. \n\nReal-world value: Given the increasing number of large-scale publicly accessible volumetric image datasets such as CT-RATE (Hamamci et al.), Totalsegmenter (Wasserthal et al.), and AbdomenAtlas (Li et al.), and the derived 3D foundation models, the real-world application of the proposed framework is unclear. Some of these large-scale public datasets come with fine-grain pixel-wise labels and associated radiological reports which provide additional supervision signals and text alignment potentials. The claimed generalization capability can be learned from multi-site large real-world datasets as well, through the intrinsic heterogeneity of big data and possibly through intense data augmentation.\n\n### Questions\n\nThe proposed workflow involves many hyper-parameters (Figure 12) controlling the properties of generated synthetic volumes -- what is the rule of thumb for choosing them?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nN/A",

The data generation method consists of drawing samples from a semantically labelled repository of biomedical shape templates to randomly populate an empty 3D volume. The volume is then deformed. Empty space and organ 'envelopes' are also simulated. To simulate different modalities and protocols, random intensity transformation is applied to the deformed 3D volume to yield 2 images. Typical imaging artifacts such a sbias field and blurring are simulated through random augmentations.The two images are fed into a UNet, and contrastive pre-training is performed on features at each decoder layer. An anchor point is chosen in one of the images, and all voxels of that label in both images are considered positive, and everything else negative pairs. The network yields features that can be used to finetune on other modalities and tasks. Importantly, the representations are modality-agnostic and anatomy-agnostic.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The paper is very well written - it lays out the prior work and puts the contirbute in context.\n* The approach yields representations that are both modality-agnostic and task-agnostic while removing the need for dataset-specific and anatomy-specific pre-training.\n* Authors present results of several downstream tasks using their features including multi-modality registration image registration and few-shot segmentation on which their method outperform the others compared.\n* Authors perform ablation studies on the various components of their pipeilne.\n* The Authors present extensive visualization and quantitative results in their main text, and supplementary material.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses the challenge of limited generalization in volumetric biomedical foundation models due to small and domain-specific 3D datasets. The authors propose a representation learning framework combining: (1) a synthetic data engine that generates highly variable training samples using randomized compositions of biomedical shape templates from TotalSegmentator (Section 3, Figure 2), and (2) a contrastive learning method that pretrains a 3D UNet to be stable against nuisance imaging variation while preserving semantic consistency (Equation 1, Figure 3). The method trains exclusively on synthetic data without using any real biomedical images. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised multimodality registration across L2RAb and MM-WHS datasets (Figure 5, Table 2) and competitive few-shot segmentation results across six diverse datasets (Table 1), establishing the first 3D biomedical foundation model capable of both registration and segmentation tasks.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation lacks precision and completeness**\n  - The contrastive loss definition in Equation 1 uses ambiguous notation where spatial indices are pooled from both volumes (I = {1,...,2HWD}) but the relationship between indices across V1 and V2 is unclear, making reproducibility difficult\n  - The positive set P(i) definition assumes label correspondence across volumes but doesn't specify how spatial alignment is maintained during geometric augmentations, creating potential training inconsistencies\n  - Temperature parameter τ = 0.33 deviates significantly from standard contrastive learning values (typically 0.07-0.1) but lacks theoretical justification or sensitivity analysis in the main text\n\n• **Experimental evaluation has significant methodological limitations**\n  - Registration baselines exclude recent deep learning methods like VoxelMorph variants that could provide stronger comparisons, limiting the scope of performance claims (Section 4.1)\n  - Few-shot segmentation uses only 1-3 training volumes per dataset (Table 1), which may not reflect realistic clinical deployment scenarios where more data is typically available\n  - Cross-validation or multiple random splits are not reported, raising questions about statistical significance and generalizability of the Dice improvements shown in Table 1\n  - The MM-WHS dataset required substantial preprocessing including custom spine annotations (Appendix B.4.4), potentially introducing evaluation bias\n\n• **Limited technical novelty and insufficient analysis of design choices**\n  - The synthetic data engine primarily combines existing techniques (Dead Leaves model, domain randomization) with biomedical templates, offering incremental rather than fundamental innovation (Section 2, Page 3)\n  - Ablation studies in Table 3 show relatively small performance differences between design choices, questioning the necessity of the proposed complexity\n  - The choice of TotalSegmentator templates introduces potential bias toward CT-based anatomical structures, but impact on MRI-heavy datasets is not thoroughly analyzed\n  - Feature visualization in Figure 1 lacks quantitative stability metrics, relying only on qualitative assessment of cross-modal consistency\n\n• **Insufficient baseline comparisons and evaluation scope**\n  - Comparison with 2D foundation models like DINOv2 is relegated to appendix (Table 8) despite their widespread adoption in medical imaging, understating competitive landscape\n  - Large-scale medical foundation models comparison (SuPreM in Table 9) shows the proposed method's advantages are modest, questioning practical significance\n  - Registration experiments lack comparison with learning-based multimodal registration methods that could leverage similar synthetic training strategies\n  - The multitask evaluation in Table 2 tests only one additional task (registration), insufficient to claim general-purpose capabilities\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and strengthen mathematical formulations**\n  - Provide explicit spatial correspondence mechanism between V1 and V2 indices in Equation 1, including how geometric augmentations preserve label alignment during training\n  - Add theoretical analysis or empirical justification for the τ = 0.33 choice, including comparison with standard contrastive learning temperatures\n  - Include algorithmic pseudocode for the complete contrastive training procedure to ensure reproducibility\n\n• **Enhance experimental rigor and scope**\n  - Include recent deep learning registration baselines (e.g., VoxelMorph variants, TransMorph) to provide comprehensive performance comparison\n  - Expand few-shot evaluation to include 5-10 training volumes scenarios that better reflect clinical reality\n  - Report confidence intervals and statistical significance tests across multiple random dataset splits for all major results\n  - Validate registration performance on standard datasets without custom preprocessing to ensure fair comparison\n\n• **Strengthen technical contributions and analysis**\n  - Conduct systematic ablation study comparing synthetic vs. real label sources with quantitative stability metrics beyond visual inspection\n  - Analyze the impact of TotalSegmentator's CT bias on different imaging modalities with dedicated experiments\n  - Provide theoretical framework connecting synthetic data diversity to downstream generalization performance\n  - Include quantitative feature stability analysis (e.g., mutual information, correlation) to supplement Figure 1 visualizations\n\n• **Expand baseline comparisons and evaluation comprehensiveness**\n  - Move DINOv2 and large-scale foundation model comparisons to main text with detailed analysis of when synthetic pretraining outperforms real data approaches\n  - Include learning-based multimodal registration methods trained on synthetic data for direct comparison\n  - Evaluate on additional tasks (e.g., classification, detection) to substantiate general-purpose claims beyond registration and segmentation\n  - Provide computational cost analysis comparing synthetic pretraining with real data collection and annotation efforts",

    "abstract": "With the rise of medical foundation models and the growing availability of imaging data, scalable pretraining techniques offer a promising way to identify imaging biomarkers predictive of future disease risk. While current self-supervised methods for 3D medical imaging models capture local structural features like organ morphology, they fail to link pixel biomarkers with long-term health outcomes due to a missing context problem. Current approaches lack the temporal context necessary to identify biomarkers correlated with disease progression, as they rely on supervision derived only from images and concurrent text descriptions. To address this, we introduce time-to-event pretraining, a pretraining framework for 3D medical imaging models that leverages large-scale temporal supervision from paired, longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Using a dataset of 18,945 CT scans (4.2 million 2D images) and time-to-event distributions across thousands of EHR-derived tasks, our method improves outcome prediction, achieving an average AUROC increase of 23.7% and a 29.4% gain in Harrell’s C-index across 8 benchmark tasks. Importantly, these gains are achieved without sacrificing diagnostic classification performance. This study lays the foundation for integrating longitudinal EHR and 3D imaging data to advance clinical risk prediction.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\n*Edit: Score increased from 6 to 8 during discussion period.*\n\nThis paper presents a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for 3D medical imaging data that leverages electronic health records (EHR) to provide extra sources of supervision via time-to-event modeling. The proposed method, future-guided pretraining, performs time-to-event (TTE) survival modeling of various medical events in the longitudinal EHR associated with each 3D scan. The authors show that future-guided pretraining consistently improves downstream TTE modeling and prognostic classification tasks – also improving data efficiency – without degrading standard diagnostic classification performance.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The presentation quality is very high. Care has been taken to logically organize the paper, clearly articulate key points, and straightforwardly present results with concise figures and tables.\n- The core idea is creative, making use of the wealth of longitudinal EHR data associated with each 3D volume for pretraining.\n- Discussion or related work and background is particularly strong.\n- Experiments are sufficiently thorough and easy to interpret – results are convincing.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- The actual description of the TTE pretraining approach is brief (lines 184-191) and somewhat unclear. I would advise the authors to flesh out this section. See specific questions below.\n- A description or list of the 8,192 EHR pretraining tasks is never provided. I’m aware there may not be a convenient place to list this many items, but a general description of categories of events or a few illustrative examples would be helpful. Without this information, it’s impossible to assess whether, e.g., one the TTE pretraining tasks is *also* used as a downstream TTE modeling task. In this case, there may be concerns of “label leakage”.\n\nI’m happy to increase my score once these issues are addressed – this is an otherwise strong submission.\n\n### Questions\n\n- What exactly does it mean that Steinberg et al.’s method was used to “[sample tasks to maximize entropy given the frequency distribution of medical codes populating the DAG”? I feel that a basic plain-language description of the motivation for this procedure is needed first: why is this method being applied at all? Are there way more than 8k events and the goal is to settle on a subset of 8k “meaningful”/common ones for pretraining? I don’t understand the motivation.\n- Unless I am misunderstanding, this is the only description of the TTE pretraining procedure and labels used: “We define our TTE task labels by predicting the time until the next occurrence of a medical code.” The previous Section 3 described deep survival modeling in the abstract, so I expected Section 4 to more concretely describe how TTE pretraining works. Is this a “competing risks” approach, where multiple events are being modeled simultaneously (in “multi-label” fashion)?\n- What are the 8,192 EHR tasks/events? I’m aware it would be cumbersome or impossible to list and define them all, but any reasonable attempt to convey information about them would be useful. What kinds of “events” are they? What are some examples?\n- Related to the above point, are the downstream labels *also* present in the set of TTE pretraining tasks? If so, isn’t there concern of “label leakage”, where the model has been pretrained on label information present in the downstream training dataset? Please clarify this.\n\n**Minor comments/questions:**\n- Line 13: Maybe “build” instead of “capture” since you use this word in the next sentence.\n- In-text citation style seems off – should be parenthetical (\\pcite{}) in most cases when used at end of sentence/clause: “Sox et al. (2024)” -> “(Sox et al., 2024)”\n- Change “e.g.” -> “e.g.,” throughout\n- Would include more recent references [1,2] when discussing deep prognosis models on longitudinal medical imaging (first paragraph of Section 2)\n- “i.e. 8192” -> “i.e., 8.192”\n- “Our approach improves training data efficiency, increasing training labels by an average of 3x over labels assigned to patients based on their current EHR visit.” This is a bit unusual to highlight as a main contribution – I don’t think readers will understand what “increasing training labels” means without having read the entire paper (nor why this impact data efficiency). Perhaps clarify language here to indicate that your approach provides 3x as many sources of supervision during SSL + that this is what provides data efficiency benefits.\n- “Pretraining task labels as assigned per-CT scan and vary in density based on pretraining approach, see Figure 2.” Perhaps “as assigned” is meant to be “are assigned”? Also change “, see Figure 2” -> “(Figure 2)”.\n- Be consistent with “c-statistic” vs. “C-statistic”\n\n**References**\n[1] Holste, Gregory, et al. \"Harnessing the power of longitudinal medical imaging for eye disease prognosis using Transformer-based sequence modeling.\" NPJ Digital Medicine 7.1 (2024): 216.\n[2] Sriram, Anuroop, et al. \"Covid-19 prognosis via self-supervised representation learning and multi-image prediction.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2101.04909 (2021).\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript presents a future-guided pretraining framework that integrates time-to-event (TTE) supervision with longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data to enhance prognostic modeling from 3D medical images. The model aims to improve representation learning by predicting time-until-outcome following imaging acquisition. Experimental results show consistent performance gains over conventional imaging-only pretraining methods across multiple benchmark tasks. The paper is clearly written and technically sound, though some methodological dependencies and interpretability aspects warrant further clarification.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Dependence on Large EHR Datasets:** The proposed approach requires substantial, well-curated EHR collections synchronized with imaging data. Such resources are not widely available, limiting the method’s applicability to institutions with large integrated datasets.  \n2. **Limited Modality Evaluation:** Experiments are restricted to CT imaging, leaving open the question of whether the approach generalizes to other modalities (e.g., MRI, X-ray). Demonstrating cross-modality performance would strengthen the paper’s claims of generality.  \n3. **Interpretability and Feature Attribution:** The link between TTE-based pretraining and specific imaging biomarkers remains insufficiently explained. More analysis on which spatial features contribute to improved prognostic performance would improve transparency and trustworthiness.  \n4. **Impact of EHR Time Segmentation:** Further explanation is needed regarding how the temporal granularity of EHR-based time segments (e.g., 1-, 2-, or 3-year intervals) influences model performance. This design choice may substantially affect the learned representations.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify the rationale for focusing on 3D imaging rather than 2D modalities—whether due to dataset availability or prior work in 2D settings.  \n- Ensure consistent terminology when referring to time-to-event intervals and survival probabilities for clarity.\n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe study proposes an innovative fusion of imaging and longitudinal EHR data for representation learning, addressing an important problem in predictive medical imaging. It shows promising improvements (significance and innovation) supported by thorough experiments (evaluation). However, reproducibility may be constrained by data availability and incomplete methodological detail concerning time segmentation and feature interpretation.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Recommendation: Major Revision.** The work is innovative and well-executed but requires additional justification on data requirements, temporal design choices, and modality generalization before acceptance.",

Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript presents a *methodological innovation* in medical image modeling — a new *time‑to‑event (TTE) pretraining* framework for 3‑D imaging encoders that integrates longitudinal EHR‑derived temporal supervision. This lies firmly within the scope of IEEE *Transactions on Medical Imaging*, which emphasizes new imaging algorithms, reconstruction and modeling techniques, and machine‑learning methods grounded in imaging science rather than purely clinical application.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe study introduces the first large‑scale *TTE pretraining paradigm for 3‑D medical images*. It bridges survival analysis and large‑scale representation learning, moving beyond per‑exam or static self‑supervised schemes. The idea of using TTE distributions as supervision signals in pretraining is distinctly new for imaging foundation models. The contribution level is high, provided the implementation and validation are rigorous.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe technical formulation of the piecewise exponential neural network and the PEANN‑based loss is mathematically consistent; the authors also present ablations, metrics (AUROC, Harrell’s C‑index, Brier score), and comparisons to strong baselines. However, parts of the methodology—such as details of task sampling from 8,192 events, data harmonization, and how censorship handling interacts with multitask pretraining—should be explained more precisely. Experiments are extensive, use publicly available datasets (INSPECT and RSPECT), and include statistical confidence intervals. Overall rigor is good, though the theoretical justification for why TTE pretraining improves representation quality could be expanded.\n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe paper is clearly structured with detailed tables, appendices, and well‑commented figures. The terminology (“missing context problem,” “piecewise exponential neural network”) is appropriate for the field. Minor language polishing could improve readability; currently, the manuscript is densely written.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \n✅ The authors use publicly released, de‑identified datasets, describe compliance with HIPAA requirements, and provide open code and checkpoints. Ethical considerations and subgroup bias analyses are included, aligning with reproducibility and fairness expectations of *TMI*.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report\n\n#### 1. Summary\nThis paper proposes **time‑to‑event (TTE) pretraining** for 3‑D medical image foundation models. The method links each imaging study to long‑term EHR outcomes to learn representations predictive not only of current disease but of *future events*. Using a **piecewise exponential neural network (PEANN)** as the survival objective, 8,192 EHR‑derived TTE tasks are generated across ~19k CT exams. The pretrained encoder is evaluated by linear and Cox‐based probes on eight outcome‑prediction tasks and eight diagnostic tasks. Results show mean gains of roughly 20–30 % in AUROC and Harrell’s C‑index on prognostic prediction without loss of diagnostic accuracy.\n\n#### 2. Strengths\n- **Methodological novelty**: introduces TTE modeling as a large‑scale pretraining signal for 3‑D imaging.  \n- **Technical soundness**: clearly formulated PEANN loss and comprehensive experimental design.  \n- **Empirically broad**: multi‑architecture validation (SwinUNETR, DenseNet, ResNet), multiple performance metrics, and subgroup fairness checks.  \n- **Reproducibility and openness**: code, model weights, and dataset identifiers are supplied.  \n- **Clinical relevance**: connects imaging features to long‑term outcomes, addressing a key gap in prognostic imaging.\n\n#### 3. Weaknesses\n- Limited theoretical explanation of *why* survival‑based supervision yields more transferable representations beyond increased label density.  \n- EHR–imaging alignment and task‑sampling procedure depend on several heuristic design choices; robustness to those choices is not explored.  \n- Evaluation restricted to chest CT; generalizability to other modalities, body regions, and tasks remains untested.  \n- Compute cost is extremely high (hundreds of GPU‑hours), potentially limiting reproducibility for typical labs.  \n- Writing is occasionally repetitive; the message could be clearer with condensation of tables/figures.\n\n#### 4. Major Comments\n1. **Clarify the pretraining objective integration:** Expand Section 4 describing how multiple TTE tasks are optimized jointly — whether losses are summed, weighted, or sampled per batch. Include sensitivity analysis for the number of time bins and task selection method (entropy‑ranked vertex cover).  \n2. **Provide deeper theoretical motivation:** Connect the survival likelihood to representation learning theory—why should time‑dependent hazard supervision improve prognostic encoding?  \n3. **Generalization assessment:** Consider at least one non‑thoracic dataset or 2‑D modality to test transferability beyond chest CT.  \n4. **Compute and scalability discussion:** Include a quantitative comparison of performance versus compute cost or label density to highlight efficiency gains.  \n5. **Bias and censoring:** Elaborate on how competing risks and varying censoring distributions affect training stability; include discussion of possible biases introduced by EHR‑derived event times.\n\n#### 5. Minor Comments\n- Proofread for minor grammar inconsistencies (“pretrianing,” “inspsect”).  \n- Some figures (e.g., Grad‑CAM montages, Appendix Q) could be resized or compressed; the main text may summarize key examples instead of showing all.  \n- Consolidate identical numeric results presented across tables/appendices; highlight essential findings in the primary text.  \n- Add consistent notation for survival time variables; some equations reuse symbols (T, ˜T) inconsistently.  \n- Cite recent TMI relevant works on self‑supervised risk prediction if available.\n\n#### 6. Overall Recommendation  \n**Major Revision** – The study is promising and methodologically innovative, clearly within TMI’s scope, but requires stronger justification, clearer methodological exposition, and possibly an additional demonstration of generalizability. With these revisions, it could reach TMI’s publication standard.\n\n#### 7. Confidence Level  \n**4/5** – High confidence in assessment; the reviewer has expertise in medical imaging machine learning and time‑to‑event modeling.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Decision:**  \nThe paper offers *substantive methodological advancement* with strong empirical evidence and reproducibility. Addressing the above major comments—particularly on theoretical motivation, cross‑modality robustness, and detailed implementation clarity—would likely make it a strong candidate for publication in *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces time-to-event (TTE) pretraining for 3D medical imaging models to address the \"missing context problem\" in current self-supervised learning approaches. The authors argue that existing methods fail to learn prognostic biomarkers because they rely only on imaging data and concurrent text descriptions, lacking temporal information about disease progression. Their method leverages longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) to create 8,192 TTE pretraining tasks using piecewise exponential neural networks (PEANN). The approach is evaluated on 18,945 CT scans from the INSPECT dataset and tested on three architectures (SwinUNETR, DenseNet-121, ResNet-152). Results show average improvements of 23.7% in AUROC and 29.4% in Harrell's C-index across 8 benchmark tasks for prognostic prediction, while maintaining diagnostic classification performance on the RSPECT dataset.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and notation clarity issues**\n  - Equation 1 uses inconsistent notation where the survival function Si(t) depends on both patient i and time piece p, but the relationship between image-specific representations Mip and the hazard calculation is unclear (Section 3, Equation 1)\n  - The derivation of the loss function references Appendix M but the main text lacks sufficient mathematical detail to verify the PEANN implementation independently (Section 3, page 5)\n  - The piecewise exponential model assumes constant hazard rates within intervals, but the paper doesn't adequately justify this assumption for medical events or discuss potential violations (Section 3, Equation 1)\n\n• **Limited experimental scope and generalizability concerns**\n  - The evaluation is restricted to chest CT scans from a single institution (INSPECT dataset), limiting generalizability across different imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and healthcare systems (Table 1, Section 5)\n  - Only three architectures are tested, with two (DenseNet, ResNet) using 2D weight inflation rather than native 3D pretraining, potentially confounding the comparison (Section 5, page 7)\n  - The baseline comparisons lack strong SSL methods specifically designed for 3D medical imaging, making it difficult to assess the true benefit of TTE supervision over state-of-the-art alternatives (Section 5, page 7)\n\n• **Methodological limitations in task selection and evaluation design**\n  - The entropy-ranked vertex cover approach for selecting 8,192 pretraining tasks from 4.3 million candidates lacks sufficient detail and validation of task relevance (Section 4, page 5)\n  - The frozen encoder evaluation strategy may not reflect real-world deployment scenarios where full fine-tuning is often preferred (Section 4, page 6)\n  - Statistical significance testing uses bootstrap confidence intervals but doesn't adequately address multiple comparisons across numerous tasks and metrics (Section 5, Tables 2-4)\n\n• **Insufficient analysis of temporal assumptions and competing risks**\n  - The method treats patient death as the only competing risk and censors at death, but medical events often have complex competing risk structures that could bias results (Section 4, page 6)\n  - The choice of uniform time bins for the piecewise exponential model lacks justification and sensitivity analysis across different temporal discretizations (Section 5, page 6)\n  - No evidence found in the manuscript for handling time-varying covariates or validating the proportional hazards assumption underlying the evaluation metrics\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Provide complete mathematical derivations in the main text rather than relegating them to appendices, ensuring all notation is clearly defined and consistently used throughout\n  - Include formal justification for the piecewise exponential assumption with empirical validation on the medical event data\n  - Add sensitivity analyses examining how different choices of time intervals and hazard rate assumptions affect model performance\n\n• **Expand experimental validation scope**\n  - Evaluate the approach on multiple datasets from different institutions and imaging modalities to demonstrate broader applicability beyond chest CT scans\n  - Include comparisons with recent 3D SSL methods specifically designed for medical imaging rather than relying primarily on 2D weight inflation baselines\n  - Conduct experiments using native 3D pretrained models for all architectures to ensure fair comparisons\n\n• **Strengthen methodological foundations and evaluation protocols**\n  - Provide detailed algorithmic descriptions and validation studies for the entropy-ranked vertex cover task selection method, including ablation studies on different numbers of selected tasks\n  - Compare frozen encoder results with full fine-tuning approaches to better understand the trade-offs and practical deployment considerations\n  - Implement proper multiple comparison corrections and provide more comprehensive statistical analysis addressing the numerous hypothesis tests conducted\n\n• **Address temporal modeling limitations comprehensively**\n  - Extend the competing risk analysis beyond death censoring to include other relevant competing events and validate these assumptions empirically\n  - Conduct systematic sensitivity analyses across different temporal discretization schemes and validate the impact on downstream performance\n  - Incorporate methods for handling time-varying covariates and provide empirical validation of key survival analysis assumptions using the available longitudinal data",

However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence.\nTo mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans.\nTo achieve it, we first formulate \\textbf{Region-Centric tasks} and construct a \\textbf{large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct,} to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a \\textbf{Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA}, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. The codes and model will be made publicly available.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a new large-scale, multi-site, medical visual-question answering (VQA) dataset, called MedRegInstruct, with fine-grained region-specific annotation and multiple corresponding region-centric tasks. The proposed dataset contains multiple region-centric evaluation tasks including, region-to-text generation, text-to-region detection, and grounded medical report generation. The paper further proposed a new region-aware multi-modal large language model (MLLM), called, MedRegA, pre-trained with the proposed dataset and regional chain of thought (CoT). The proposed method outperforms multiple existing SOTA medical VQA models on the regional-centric evaluation.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 4\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed new region-centric medical dataset MedRegInstruct addressed the need for fine-grained, region-level, training and evaluation datasets in the medical domain. It is novel to the field and will help the development of the field as provides a more fine-grained training and evaluation annotation. It is proven that the method pre-trained with the new dataset can demonstrate more robust performance in the targeted region-specific tasks and also other related medical tasks. \n2. The paper has provided enough details about the data curation and evaluation, including the process of question-answering pair generation from medical data with region annotation, a prompt for each downstream evaluation, and detailed settings for each task. The author also seems to claim they will release the code and pre-trained model later.\n3. The paper is overall well written with nice figures and a clean presentation. It is easy to follow even if there are many details in it.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. While the proposed dataset is novel and important to the field, the corresponding MedRegA model is not that novel, though I hate to say that, in comparison. The overall model design is basically the same as the base InternVL model and the major change is the training scheme and prompt formulation with the new dataset, which can be extended to other medical VQL models as well. While the author further proposed single-step regional CoT in the paper, it is still relatively straightforward. **Yet**, this is not a major drawback as the performance of this model demonstrates the superiority of training with the proposed dataset.\n2. Similarly, it seems that the baselines used in the evaluation are not all fine-tuned with the proposed dataset, which enables the model to understand regional information. Comparing the model trained on the proposed dataset with baselines that are not trained on this dataset is not very fair, to some extent. It would be interesting to see how well each baseline would improve if they were fine-tuned on the proposed dataset, even if just in a few-shot manner.\n3. Another concern about this paper is the quality of the data. Most of the regional bounding box-text pairs in the dataset were taken from the existing dataset and generated from an automated rule-based system and an LLM. The evaluation of the data quality is missing in this paper, which is very critical as the main purpose is **fine-grained regional evaluation,** where the quality of the bounding box and the correctness of the corresponding text description are very important. It would be better if some sort of data quality check could be done before releasing it to the public.\n\n### Questions\n\nOverall, this is a good paper with solid contributions and it has a significant meaning to the field. Still, the reviewer has a few questions here.\n\n1. How is the English version of the text report/caption generated for the in-house Chinese data? What kind of translation was used here?\n2. According to the “Structure Detection” section on page 5, the structure bounding box in the dataset was generated with a fine-tuned MLLM on the existing Region-Text dataset given the corresponding organ prompt. The reviewer wonders if any kind of evaluation was done on this fine-tuned MLLM, how accurate is the extract bounding box? And why not train a more straightforward detection model for this purpose? Considering that the specific detection model usually performs better than a general MLLM.\n3. Also, as mentioned above, the reviewer wonders how much will the other baseline medical MLLMs improve if they were trained with the proposed dataset. The comparison between InternVL and MedRegA in the paper is not very fair as the InternVL was only trained with natural image-text pairs. The reviewer understands it may take tons of extra time/money to conduct such an evaluation, but it would still be an interesting question to explore.\n4. According to the abstract, the code and model will be released to the public, but the reviewer wonders if the data will be released as well. This is pretty critical as the dataset is the major contribution of the paper. The answer to this question will influence the reviewer's final score for the paper.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- Yes, Privacy, security and safety\n- Yes, Responsible research practice (e.g., human subjects, data release)\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nThe paper proposed a new medical visual question-answering dataset with in-house medical imaging data from a Chinese hospital. Though the author has an ethics statement section in the paper, further ethics evaluation may be needed to ensure there is no critical ethical issue.",

The introduction of a single-step regional CoT, though an improvement, remains straightforward.\n2. **Baseline Evaluation:** The evaluation comparisons may not be entirely fair, as not all baselines were fine-tuned on the proposed dataset that enables regional information comprehension. Investigating their performance after fine-tuning, even in a few-shot manner, would be valuable.\n3. **Data Quality Concerns:** A significant concern arises regarding data quality since the regional bounding box-text pairs were sourced from existing datasets and generated via an automated rule-based system and an LLM.

However, concerns exist regarding the novelty of the MedRegA model and the fairness of the evaluation against baseline models not trained on this dataset.

It also presents *MedRegA*, a region-aware multimodal large language model (MLLM) pre-trained on this dataset using a regional chain-of-thought mechanism. The paper is clearly written, well-structured, and easy to follow, with informative figures and a clean presentation. Overall, the work significantly contributes to the expansion of fine-grained, region-level medical VQA data and models.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty of the Model:** While the dataset contribution is strong, the novelty of the proposed MedRegA model is limited. Its architecture largely follows the existing InternVL model, with the principal difference being the training scheme and regional prompts. The single-step regional chain-of-thought extension is conceptually straightforward. Although these modifications demonstrate improved performance, methodological innovation is modest.  \n2. **Fairness of Comparisons:** The evaluation may not be fully fair, as baselines were not fine-tuned on the proposed dataset. Since MedRegA benefits from this dataset’s regional annotations, the comparison potentially favors the new model. Additional experiments fine-tuning other baselines—even in a few-shot setting—would provide fairer comparisons and better contextualize gains.  \n3. **Data Quality Assessment:** The dataset combines bounding box–text pairs extracted from existing datasets and those produced via automated rule-based and LLM-based systems. However, no quantitative or qualitative evaluation of data quality is provided. Given the paper’s emphasis on fine-grained regional tasks, verifying annotation quality (bounding box accuracy and text correctness) is essential.  \n4. **Dataset Release and Translation Details:** Clarification is needed on whether the dataset will be publicly released, as this is central to the paper’s impact. Additional details are also requested on how English captions were generated from Chinese data (e.g., translation methods).  \n5. **Region Detection Method:** The “Structure Detection” step reportedly uses a fine-tuned MLLM rather than a dedicated detection model. An evaluation of this step’s accuracy or a rationale for not using a specialized detector would strengthen the technical soundness.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Please clarify if ethical approval and patient data anonymization procedures are confirmed for the in-house medical data.  \n- A few notational clarifications and implementation details (e.g., prompt formats) would improve reproducibility.  \n- Ensure the paper explicitly states future release plans for data, code, and models.\n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \n*Significance:* The proposed dataset fills an important gap in region-level medical VQA, enabling fine-grained reasoning.  \n*Innovation:* The dataset itself is the primary innovation; the model design is comparatively incremental.  \n*Evaluation:* Experimental results show strong performance, though fairness concerns remain regarding non-fine-tuned baselines and lack of data quality assessment.  \n*Reproducibility:* The methodology and experiments are described in detail, and prospective data/code release would enhance reproducibility. Ethical considerations regarding medical data warrant additional verification.\n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision** – Strong contribution through dataset introduction, but concerns about model novelty, fairness of evaluation, dataset quality validation, and the transparency of data release need to be addressed before acceptance.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nIn this work, the authors tackle the current problem in MLLMs (multimodal large language models) of how they don't necessarily \"focus\" on particular regions, but rather take the entire image as context and then have to solve a variety of downstream tasks. To address this problem they offer two main sets of contributions. The first, is the formulation of several region specific tasks, namely region-to-text identification, text-to-region detection, and grounded report generation, which they combine into a dataset called MedRegInstruct. The second is the training strategy and modeling paradigm for a MLLM they propose, which they refer to as MedRegA. MedRegA is a bilingual, as it was trained on both English and Chinese paired datapoints, model that they apply to this larger dataset they prepare in comparison to currently available medical MLLMs.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 4\n\n### Strengths\n\n• The paper really introduces another method of interaction, in the bounding boxes, that can be quite useful as MedRegA is able to reason about specific regions. This is an immensely useful tool for narrowing of problems as opposed to current trained MLLMs have to do.\n\n• The proposed training strategy for learning how to incorporate the bounding boxes is simple and scalable, seems like it could be generally applied to other strategies that want to apply bounding boxes.\n\n• Regional CoT makes a lot of sense intuitively and provides a nice bias for solving region specific problems.\n\n• MedRegA has very strong performance on the chosen set of benchmarks and metrics in comparison to existing state of the art methods.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n• The section of the report grounding dataset is quite confusing as to how its constructed, and how much it relies on the models it uses for automation for providing correct labels/groundtruth. For example, is InternLM perfect at sub-select different parts of the reports? \n\n• The paper claims to work across a broad set of modalities, but when considering the grounding dataset it seems that it only considers, as other MLLMs do, Chest Xrays?\n\n• It's unclear if the comparison to existing baselines are exactly fair as the trained MedRegA has access to more data. In fact, compared to the baseline of InternLM, it should be strictly better because MedRegA is trained with InternLM as an initialization. While it's true that the baselines don't provide a mechanism for highlighting particular regions, they still should be adapted to the new data that the authors are evaluating on.\n\n### Questions\n\n• What was the filtering criterion for reducing SA-Med2D-20M?\n\n• Is there a noticeable performance difference between English and Chinese tasks? Is there paired data that this can be evaluated on? • • • \n\n• Overall, it is unclear from the paper why exactly these two particular languages are used, other than being able to source data for both, rather than just arbitrary languages with medical report data.\n\n• Is the MedRegInstruct dataset planning to be release?\nFor the Region-Text dataset, why is the case that there needs to be this split into half for region-to-text and half for text-to-region? Can't every datapoint server the purpose of being either during training?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The authors contribute a solution through the development of region-specific tasks, encapsulating these in a dataset called MedRegInstruct. Additionally, they propose a new MLLM model, MedRegA, trained on both English and Chinese data, which they evaluate against existing medical MLLMs.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. The formulation of tasks such as region-to-text identification, text-to-region detection, and grounded report generation is innovative and potentially enhances the functionality of MLLMs in medical contexts.\n2. However, the construction of the report grounding dataset lacks clarity, particularly regarding its reliance on automation for accurate labeling, raising questions about the effectiveness of the model used for labeling.\n3. The claim of multi-modality in the manuscript is questionable, as the grounding dataset appears limited to chest X-rays, similar to other MLLMs.\n4. The fairness of baseline comparisons is uncertain; MedRegA seems to have advantages due to its training data access, which raises concerns about the validity of performance claims relative to existing models like InternLM.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- Clarification is needed regarding the filtering criteria for SA-Med2D-20M.\n- Is there a notable performance difference between the tasks conducted in English and Chinese, and is there paired data to reflect this?\n- The rationale behind selecting English and Chinese for data sourcing is not adequately justified.\n- Clarification on whether the MedRegInstruct dataset will be released is necessary.\n- The decision to split the dataset into half for region-to-text and half for text-to-region tasks warrants further explanation; can’t each data point serve both purposes in training?\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nIn terms of significance, the manuscript presents a novel approach to incorporating bounding boxes in MLLMs, which enhances the focus on specific regions and offers a scalable training strategy applicable to other efforts. While its innovation lies in the proposed tasks and modeling approach, concerns remain regarding the clarity of the dataset construction and the fairness of comparative evaluations. The reproducibility of findings is also questioned given the chosen modalities and the lack of detailed performance analysis across languages. Overall, the manuscript shows promise but requires critical improvements in clarity and methodological robustness.\n\n### Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision is recommended to address the outlined concerns and enhance the overall quality and transparency of the research.",

They further describe a training paradigm integrating bounding box information and a “Regional Chain of Thought” (CoT) mechanism. Overall, the paper is clearly written and presents a technically sound approach with strong empirical results on several benchmarks.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Dataset Construction Clarity:** The description of the report grounding dataset is confusing. Details about its construction, the extent of automation, and the accuracy of models (e.g., InternLM) used to generate labels are not sufficiently explained.  \n2. **Scope of Modalities:** Although the paper claims multimodal generality, it appears that only chest X-rays are considered for grounding. The extent of modality coverage should be clarified.  \n3. **Fairness of Comparisons:** The fairness of comparisons with baselines is uncertain. MedRegA benefits from more data and is initialized from InternLM, which may bias results. It is unclear whether baseline models were adapted to the same data for a fair evaluation.  \n4. **Language Choices:** The motivation for selecting English and Chinese as training languages requires elaboration beyond data availability. Clarify whether paired bilingual datasets are used and if performance varies across languages.  \n5. **Dataset Release and Design Decisions:** Specify whether *MedRegInstruct* will be publicly released. Additionally, explain the rationale for dividing region-text pairs into separate region-to-text and text-to-region subsets instead of allowing bidirectional training from all examples.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Provide more detail on the filtering criterion used to reduce the SA-Med2D-20M dataset.  \n- Minor editorial suggestions include improving clarity in the dataset section and explicitly stating figure details and dataset statistics.\n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe manuscript is significant for introducing a novel way to incorporate spatial localization into MLLMs through bounding box–based interaction and Regional CoT reasoning. Its innovation lies in extending multimodal comprehension to region-focused learning with a straightforward, scalable training scheme. Evaluation results are strong, though the data and initialization advantages limit fairness in baseline comparisons. Reproducibility is promising given the model and dataset structure, but public release details remain uncertain.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Recommendation:** Major Revision.  \nWhile the contribution is innovative and performance promising, issues regarding dataset construction, language rationale, and fairness of comparisons must be more clearly addressed before publication.",

Scope & Relevance to TMI**\n✅ **Within scope.**  \nThis paper presents a **novel methodological contribution** centered on enhancing medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with *region-centric understanding*. The work integrates spatial localization (region-to-text, text-to-region, grounded report generation) into a large bilingual medical foundation model. The emphasis on interpretability, spatial grounding, structured dataset design, and model formulation positions it squarely within **medical imaging methodology** — particularly image understanding and vision-language modeling. Suitable for IEEE *TMI*.\n\n### **2. Novelty & Contribution Level**\nThe introduction of a **region-aware medical MLLM** and the formulation of **region-centric tasks** (MedRegInstruct dataset, Region-CoT mechanism, and Region-Aligned evaluation scheme) represent a step beyond prior “global” or holistic MLLMs such as Med-Flamingo, RadFM, and MedDr.  \nKey conceptual advances:\n- Structured modeling of image-region-text alignment;\n- Semi-automated curation pipeline integrating bounding-box annotations into bilingual reports;\n- Introduction of interpretable, region-aware grounding in multimodal tasks.  \nThe novelty is incremental relative to major foundation-model efforts but methodologically strong and more interpretable — at or just above *TMI’s novelty threshold.*\n\n### **3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**\n- **Dataset construction:** detailed description, clear provenance (public + institutional data), semi-automatic annotation, and expert validation (≈93% textual accuracy, 72% bounding-box accuracy).  \n- **Modeling:** builds upon InternVL foundation; clearly stated two-stage training (alignment → instruction tuning); includes mathematical formulations of tasks and explicit representation (<box> tags).  \n- **Evaluation:** extensive benchmarking across >15 datasets, region-specific metrics, and comparisons with six baselines.  \n- Potential gaps: limited discussion of generalization to unseen modalities, ablation of dataset quality, and clinical verification of generated regions.\n\n### **4. Clarity and Presentation**\n- Generally **well written and organized**, with coherent narrative from motivation through experiments.\n- Minor grammatical issues, overuse of long sentences, and inconsistent figure captions (e.g., Figure 5/6 labeling).\n- Results tables are comprehensive but dense — clarity could improve via summarizing key metrics.\n\n### **5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**\n- Proper anonymization, IRB-like statement provided, clear delineation of public vs. private data.\n- Ethical practices well documented.\n- Reproducibility: model and code availability implied but not confirmed; specifying release plan for MedRegInstruct (public vs. derived subsets) would be helpful.\n\n---\n\n## **Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n### **1. Summary**\nThe manuscript introduces **MedRegA**, a bilingual multimodal large language model for medical imaging that explicitly models **region-level understanding**. The authors define three region-centric tasks — region-to-text identification, text-to-region detection, and grounded report generation — and create the **MedRegInstruct** dataset (≈790K samples). Leveraging a hybrid of public and in-house clinical data, the model integrates bounding-box–based regional encoding, a *Regional Chain-of-Thought* reasoning strategy, and a *Region-Aligned evaluation framework*. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over prior medical MLLMs (MedDr, RadFM, BiomedGPT, etc.) across vision-language and classification tasks, with enhanced interpretability via spatial grounding.\n\n### **2. Strengths**\n- **Methodological novelty:** clear transition from global to region-aware MLLMs in medicine.\n- **Dataset innovation:** semi-automatic bilingual dataset that supports grounding and interpretability.\n- **Comprehensive evaluation:** large experimental suite across multiple modalities and languages.\n- **Clinical interpretability:** bounding-box reasoning improves trust and transparency.\n- **Ethical & bilingual scope:** multilingual component broadens utility for global medical datasets.\n\n### **3. Weaknesses**\n- **Novelty breadth:** approach builds atop existing LLM backbones; novelty lies in dataset and task definition rather than underlying architecture.\n- **Evaluation limitations:** limited human expert validation of clinical correctness and no reader study.\n- **Annotation accuracy:** automated bounding-box localization (72%) may limit reliability for fine-grained tasks.\n- **Reproducibility:** unclear public release of weights or dataset subsets; details on computing resources could be expanded.\n- **Writing:** some redundancy; figures occasionally crowded.\n\n### **4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify methodological novelty** relative to prior grounded-reporting models (e.g., Maira‑2, AutoRG‑Brain). Explicit comparison or ablation without region-centric training would strengthen claims.\n2. **Validation of regional accuracy**—Consider radiologist-level qualitative evaluation of MedRegA’s localized predictions to substantiate interpretability and clinical realism.\n3. **Dataset transparency**—Provide explicit plan for releasing de‑identified subsets and annotation tools, consistent with IEEE TMI reproducibility.\n4. **Generalization analysis**—Include experiments on unseen modalities or pathologies to assess model robustness and domain shift sensitivity.\n5. **Ablation and explainability**—Quantify how each component (MedRegInstruct, Regional CoT) contributes to improvements on VQA and report generation.\n\n### **5. Minor Comments**\n- Improve caption clarity in Figures 2, 4, 6.\n- Correct minor typos (e.g., “r egions t hey”, “interpertability”).\n- Provide parameter counts and inference speed.\n- Consider compressing large tables or moving secondary results to supplementary material.\n- Clarify whether “Region-Aligned Accuracy” ≥0.5 denotes threshold or normalized metric.\n\n### **6. Overall Recommendation**\n**Recommendation:** ★★★☆☆ **Major Revision**  \nWhile solid and relevant, the paper’s publication in *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging* would benefit from strengthened empirical validation (clinical/qualitative) and refinement of the novelty claims. The methodological framework is promising and aligns with *TMI’s* emphasis on interpretable medical imaging AI.\n\n### **7. Confidence Level**\n**4 / 5** – High confidence based on manuscript clarity, literature familiarity, and reproducible details.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nAn ambitious and well‑structured paper introducing a region‑aware paradigm for bilingual medical MLLMs. Methodologically interesting and well executed, yet requiring stronger experimental justification of clinical interpretability and fuller comparative discussion before meeting *IEEE TMI* acceptance standards.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces MedRegA, a bilingual multimodal large language model designed to address region-centric tasks in medical imaging. The authors identify that existing medical MLLMs are region-agnostic, treating entire images holistically without focusing on specific anatomical regions. To address this limitation, they propose three region-centric tasks: Region-to-Text Identification, Text-to-Region Detection, and Grounded Report Generation. The authors construct MedRegInstruct, a large-scale dataset containing 550K region-text triplets and 240K grounded reports from both public datasets and 25K clinical scans from Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital. MedRegA is built upon InternVL 1.2 and trained using alignment training followed by instruction tuning. Experimental results show improvements over existing methods across visual question answering, report generation, and medical image classification tasks, with the model achieving bilingual capabilities in both English and Chinese.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Dataset Construction and Validation Concerns**\n  - The automatic labeling system for structure detection achieves only 72% accuracy compared to human annotations (Page 5), which may introduce systematic errors that propagate through training and evaluation\n  - Human validation is limited to only 50 samples with 2 experts (Page 5), providing insufficient statistical power to assess dataset quality across the claimed 790K total samples\n  - The rule-based strategy for organ summarization and LLM-based report segmentation lacks detailed validation metrics beyond sentence-level accuracy of 93.33% (Page 5)\n\n• **Mathematical Formulation and Technical Specification Issues**\n  - Bounding box coordinates are normalized to integers within [0, 1000) (Page 6) but the paper lacks explanation of why this specific range was chosen or how it affects model performance\n  - The Region-Aligned evaluation framework introduces multiple complex metrics (Figure 6, Algorithm 1) but provides no theoretical justification or convergence analysis for the Hungarian Matching algorithm application\n  - Loss function specification is vague, stating only \"language model loss is applied\" (Page 6) without mathematical formulation or discussion of how region-specific losses are weighted\n\n• **Experimental Design and Evaluation Limitations**\n  - Baseline comparisons are problematic as most existing models cannot perform region-centric tasks (Table 1 shows \"✗\" for most baselines), making performance comparisons potentially misleading\n  - The Regional CoT evaluation (Table 14, Figure 19) lacks proper ablation studies to isolate the contribution of regional information versus improved prompting strategies\n  - Test set construction methodology is unclear, particularly for the bilingual evaluation where translation quality could significantly impact results (Tables 8, 10)\n\n• **Reproducibility and Implementation Concerns**\n  - Training details are relegated to appendix with insufficient hyperparameter specification in the main paper (Page 6 references \"Appendix B\" for critical implementation details)\n  - The semi-automatic pipeline for dataset construction involves multiple complex steps (Figure 3) but lacks sufficient detail for reproduction, particularly regarding the \"Doctor Finetuned MLLM\" component\n  - Clinical data collection protocol and ethical approval details are mentioned only briefly in ethics statement (Page 11) without adequate description of data preprocessing and anonymization procedures\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen Dataset Validation and Quality Assessment**\n  - Expand human validation to at least 500 samples across different modalities and anatomical regions to provide statistically meaningful quality assessment\n  - Provide detailed inter-annotator agreement scores (e.g., Cohen's kappa) for both bounding box accuracy and report segmentation quality\n  - Include analysis of how the 72% structure detection accuracy affects downstream model performance and implement error correction mechanisms\n\n• **Enhance Mathematical Rigor and Technical Clarity**\n  - Provide mathematical justification for the [0, 1000) normalization range choice and include ablation studies comparing different coordinate encoding schemes\n  - Formalize the loss function with explicit mathematical notation, including how region-specific and text-specific losses are combined and weighted\n  - Add theoretical analysis of the Hungarian Matching algorithm's computational complexity and convergence properties within the evaluation framework\n\n• **Improve Experimental Design and Analysis**\n  - Develop region-capable versions of baseline models through fine-tuning on region-centric tasks to enable fair comparison, or clearly acknowledge this limitation in the evaluation\n  - Conduct comprehensive ablation studies separating the effects of regional information, improved prompting, and bilingual training\n  - Implement cross-validation procedures for test set construction and provide confidence intervals for all reported metrics\n\n• **Enhance Reproducibility and Documentation**\n  - Move critical implementation details from appendix to main paper, including complete hyperparameter specifications, training procedures, and convergence criteria\n  - Provide detailed algorithmic descriptions and code snippets for the semi-automatic dataset construction pipeline\n  - Include comprehensive supplementary materials with dataset statistics, preprocessing steps, and detailed experimental protocols to ensure full reproducibility",

These multigranular annotations encompass both global information, such as modality and organ detection, and local information like ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. Unlike the existing multimodal datasets, which are limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and textual annotations in the form of image-ROI-description triplets without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 30 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular textual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. We propose LLaVA-Tri by pretraining LLaVA on MedTrinity-25M, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, surpassing representative SOTA multimodal large language models. Furthermore, MedTrinity-25M can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain.

The development of an automated data annotation pipeline significantly scales up medical image-text data.\n2.\tWith the support of MedTrinity-25M, the pretrained CLIP and LLaVA models demonstrate better performance compared to previous methods.\n3.\tThe release of this dataset contributes to the medical AI community, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable resource for advancing multimodal tasks and improving healthcare applications.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1.\tThe quality of the generated image-text data may not be sufficiently high. It is advisable to review the questions associated with this data. In the image-captioning constructed from MedTrinity-25M, we found that many basic imaging modalities were incorrectly identified. For instance, in the CT-RATE data used as the source, over 60,000 images were misidentified as MRI, more than 90,000 as X-ray, and even a small number were identified as endoscopy. Below, we provide some captions to illustrate this phenomenon present in MedTrinity-25M.\n“””\n{\"image_path\":\"seg_train_126_a_2-right lung.nii-34.jpg\",\"id\":\"b573995e-2d11-11ef-bbea-f02f74942466\",\"caption\":\"The image is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the thoracic region, showing the heart, part of the lung, and the spine.

The comparison of multimodal large models is limited to VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA. A broader range of specialized benchmarks, such as the health subset of MMMU, could provide a more robust comparison of the multimodal large models’ performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.\tThe data construction pipeline consists of two main steps: first, generating 200,000 multigranular textual descriptions via GPT-4V, and then fine-tuning LLaVA with this dataset. In my opinion, the performance of the trained model LLaVA-MedCap is significantly influenced by the quality of the data generated by GPT-4V. However, in Table 3, GPT-4V's performance falls far short of LLaVA-Tri. Why did you choose to use GPT-4V to generate the supervised fine-tuning data for the fine-tuning process? In my recent review of the publicly released MedTrinity-25M data, I found that many of the generated data instances were of average quality, with even simple modalities being incorrect.\n2.\tIn Section 4.1, it is stated that “The model is fine-tuned for three epochs on each VQA dataset and evaluated accordingly.” However, this evaluation setup is not fair when comparing with the methods presented in the table. Some results in Table 3 appear to be directly extracted from llava-med’s table, but these methods were not fine-tuned on the training set of the VQA benchmark. In contrast, the accuracy of the chosen llava-med method was achieved after fine-tuning for 15 epochs on the corresponding VQA benchmark training set, making this comparison inappropriate.\nCurrently, the evaluation paradigm for multimodal large models (MLLM) typically involves assessing the model directly on multiple benchmarks after two stages of pretraining and supervised fine-tuning. Therefore, I suggested distinguishing the results presented: there should be a comparison of the results not fine-tuned on the corresponding training set against the models that were not fine-tuned. Additionally, when comparing with methods fine-tuned on the corresponding training set, the number of fine-tuning epochs (including for the comparison methods) should be clearly indicated. If possible, please also conduct an ablation study regarding the number of fine-tuning epochs.\n3.\tIn Table 3, comparing CLIP-like models with LLaVA, a multimodal large model, seems inappropriate. It would be better to categorize them into two groups: one for CLIP models and another for MLLM.\n4.\tThe evaluation details in Table 3&4 are not clearly explained. What do \"open\" and \"close\" specifically refer to?  Please add a brief explanation of the \"open\" and \"close\" terms in the table caption or in the text describing the results.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n- Yes, Other reasons (please specify below)\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

Overall, the work is ambitious and of potential value to the medical AI community, though aspects of data quality, evaluation fairness, and experimental comprehensiveness warrant further improvement.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Data Quality and Modality Misidentification:** A primary concern involves the accuracy of the automatically generated image‑text annotations. Numerous instances of modality misclassification were observed—for example, CT images labeled as MRI, X‑ray, or endoscopy, and pathology images wrongly identified as radiographic studies. These errors suggest systemic issues in the caption generation process and question the reliability of the dataset for downstream modeling.  \n2. **Limited Benchmark Coverage:** The evaluation covers only a few VQA datasets (VQA‑RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA). Broader benchmarking, such as inclusion of the MMMU health subset, would yield a more comprehensive assessment of model generalization.  \n3. **Choice of Supervision Source:** The dataset construction pipeline relies on GPT‑4V to produce 200,000 textual descriptions later used to fine‑tune LLaVA‑MedCap. Given that GPT‑4V performs relatively poorly in Table 3 and that generated captions contain basic modality errors, justification for using GPT‑4V as the data source is needed.  \n4. **Unfair Evaluation Protocols:** Comparison fairness in Table 3 is problematic because competing methods were not equally fine‑tuned. The authors fine‑tuned LLaVA for three epochs, whereas other results were obtained with fifteen. Clearer differentiation between pre‑trained‑only and fine‑tuned results, and inclusion of ablation on fine‑tuning epochs, are recommended.  \n5. **Category Inconsistency:** CLIP‑like models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are compared directly in Tables 3–4. These categories should be evaluated separately for clearer interpretation.  \n6. **Ambiguity in “Open” vs “Close” Evaluation:** The meaning of these terms in Tables 3–4 is not defined and should be clarified in captions or the text.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Define all acronyms upon first use and maintain consistent table formatting.  \n- Ensure that tables explicitly describe evaluation settings, including the “open/close” terminology.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe dataset has high potential significance as one of the largest multimodal medical resources and is innovative in scalability and automated annotation. However, questions about label fidelity and modality correctness reduce confidence in reproducibility and reliability. The evaluation demonstrates promising results but is incomplete and lacks fairness in comparison. Addressing data validation, expanding benchmarks, and standardizing evaluation protocols would notably strengthen significance and reproducibility.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The dataset contribution is valuable, but substantial revisions are needed to ensure data quality, fair evaluation, and accurate reporting before acceptance.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a large-scale multimodal medical dataset comprising over 25 million images across 10 imaging modalities and covering more than 65 diseases. The dataset features multigranular annotations that include both global information and local information. The authors develop an automated pipeline that generates image-ROI-description triplets without the need for paired textual descriptions. This pipeline utilizes domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs and prompts multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to produce detailed annotations through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- Dataset Comprehensiveness: The dataset is exceptionally extensive, encompassing a wide array of imaging modalities, diseases, and anatomical structures. This diversity significantly enhances its comprehensiveness and utility for various medical AI applications.\n- Construction Pipeline through Advanced Models: The utilization of domain-specific expert models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for annotation substantially enriches the dataset. This approach adds multigranular details that improve the quality and depth of the annotations, making the dataset more valuable for training sophisticated models.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Limited Applicability for Visual Data without ROIs: The proposed pipeline relies heavily on regions of interest (ROIs) for constructing multimodal data pairs. For visual data that lack explicit ROI annotations, it is unclear how the pipeline can be effectively applied. This limitation may restrict the dataset's usability across the full spectrum of medical images, particularly those where ROI determination is challenging or subjective.\n- Impact of Multigranular Information Not Fully Explored: While Tables 3 and 4 validate the effectiveness of the benchmark in general terms, the paper does not specifically assess how the inclusion of multigranular information, such as ROIs, influences the performance of medical MLLMs. Given that ROI is a pivotal component of the dataset, a focused evaluation comparing models trained with and without multigranular information would strengthen the claims about its benefits.\n- Insufficient Discussion of Related Benchmarks: The paper lacks a thorough discussion of existing med-MLLM benchmarks that involve multigranular information. Notably, works like \"GMAI-MMBench: A Comprehensive Multimodal Evaluation Benchmark Towards General Medical AI\" and \"A Spectrum Evaluation Benchmark for Medical Multi-Modal Large Language Models\" are not cited or compared against. Including a comparative analysis would provide context and clarify how MedTrinity-25M advances the field relative to existing resources.\n- Lack of Evaluation on Multigranular-Specific Tasks: The dataset is primarily used for training and is evaluated only on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA. These evaluations may not fully capture the effectiveness of the dataset's multigranular annotations since they do not specifically target tasks designed to leverage such detailed information. This omission raises questions about the practical benefits of the multigranular data provided.\n- Challenges with Unique Medical Image Descriptions in RAG: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique used for annotation relies on a general medical knowledge base. However, medical images often have unique features and presentations, even within the same disease category. For example, Atelectasis can manifest differently in chest X-rays depending on the affected lobe. The paper does not address how the RAG system accounts for these unique variations when the initial visual datasets typically offer only generic classification labels. This could impact the accuracy and specificity of the generated annotations.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Handling of Visual Data Without ROIs: For medical images that lack explicit ROI annotations, how does your pipeline construct the corresponding multimodal data pairs? Is there a mechanism to generate or infer ROIs in such cases, or is the pipeline limited to images where ROIs are predefined?\n- Assessing the Impact of Multigranular Information on Med-MLLMs: Considering that ROIs and multigranular annotations are central to your dataset, have you conducted experiments to evaluate how these features specifically affect the performance of medical MLLMs? Can you provide insights or results that demonstrate the advantages of including multigranular information in model training?\n- Comparison with Existing Multigranular Benchmarks: Could you elaborate on how MedTrinity-25M compares with existing benchmarks that involve multigranular information? What distinguishes your dataset from these, and how does it contribute uniquely to the advancement of general medical AI?\n- Evaluation on Multigranular-Specific Tasks: Given that the dataset is evaluated only on VQA-RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA, which may not fully utilize multigranular annotations, do you have plans to test your dataset on tasks specifically designed for multigranular information? How can you demonstrate the effectiveness of your dataset's detailed annotations in improving model performance on such tasks?\n- Addressing Unique Medical Image Presentations in RAG: Medical images often present unique and variable features even when categorized under the same disease label. How does your RAG approach handle the specificity and variability of individual medical image descriptions? For instance, with conditions like Atelectasis that can manifest differently in imaging, how does the system ensure that the generated annotations accurately reflect these variations?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript proposes a methodological framework for automated, large‐scale generation of multimodal medical datasets. Though the main product is a dataset (MedTrinity‑25M), the work also introduces a structured pipeline—integrating expert segmentation models, retrieval‑augmented generation, and multimodal large language models—to synthesize “image–ROI–description” triplets. This development directly concerns imaging data curation and quantitative annotation methodology, falling within TMI’s methodological scope.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe pipeline departs from existing datasets (e.g., MIMIC‑CXR, PMC‑OA, Quilt‑1M) by removing the need for expert text pairing. Generative annotation of multigranular information (global + local + regionwise correlations) constitutes a fresh methodological idea. While some components rely on existing tools (e.g., pretrained LLMs, segmentation networks), their orchestration for scalable medical data generation and evaluation offers an original contribution. The empirical section on re‑training LLaVA provides proof‑of‑concept rather than foundational modeling advance, so the novelty centers on dataset construction and validation.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe description is detailed: data sources (30+, 25 M images), clear pipeline steps (metadata integration, ROI localization, knowledge retrieval), and both expert and LLM evaluations are provided. However, reproducibility would benefit from explicit release of processing code, model prompts, and quality control statistics per modality. The medical knowledge retrieval and privacy safeguards need slightly more elaboration (e.g., IRB considerations for reused clinical data).\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe paper is mostly clear though dense. Occasional grammar and formatting issues (e.g., duplicated spaces, capitalization) should be corrected. Figures effectively illustrate qualitative comparisons. The flow between Sections 3.2.1–3.2.2 could be tightened for readability.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nSources appear to derive from publicly available datasets, and data are said to be de‑identified. The manuscript asserts public release but should include a clear statement on license compliance and absence of protected health information. Code and generation prompts are outlined but not yet openly documented—important for transparency and validation.\n\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe paper presents *MedTrinity‑25M*, a large‑scale multimodal medical image dataset (≈25 M samples across 10 modalities). It introduces an automated pipeline that combines metadata integration, ROI localization (via ensemble of domain‑specific models), and retrieval‑augmented generation with medically tuned LLMs to produce structured “image–ROI–description” triplets. Using this dataset, the authors pre‑train an enhanced multimodal model (*LLaVA‑Tri*) that demonstrates improved accuracy on standard medical VQA benchmarks.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- First systematic framework to scale medical multimodal data generation without human text pairing.  \n- Detailed integration of vision and language modules, enabling multigranular annotations (global/local/relational).  \n- Extensive comparative evaluation against existing datasets and validation using both expert and LLM scoring.  \n- Demonstrated utility through downstream performance gains on multiple benchmarks.  \n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Limited methodological novelty in model architecture (fine‑tuning existing components).  \n- Ethical and data‑use clarifications are brief; legal compliance for redistributed data is not fully specified.  \n- Evaluation relies partly on automatic scoring by GPT‑4V, which may introduce bias; more human validation would strengthen claims.  \n- Quantitative quality metrics (e.g., inter‑rater consistency, uncertainty) are limited.  \n- Some figures and tables could be condensed or moved to supplementary to improve readability.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Reproducibility and Transparency** – Please provide all code, prompts, and configuration for the data‑generation pipeline to ensure evaluators can verify annotation quality.  \n2. **Quality Control & Validation** – Expand human evaluation beyond 200 samples, report inter‑observer agreement, and discuss potential propagation of LLM hallucination or bias.  \n3. **Ethical/Data Licensing Statement** – Explicitly describe data governance (licenses of reused datasets, patient consent status, IRB considerations).  \n4. **Scientific Positioning** – Clarify the methodological core: is the novelty primarily the scalable triplet‑generation algorithm or the resultant dataset? Explicit theoretical or algorithmic framing would help position it within imaging methodology rather than data release.  \n5. **Clinical Relevance** – Discuss how multigranular annotations concretely benefit clinical imaging tasks (e.g., lesion quantification, multimodal fusion).  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct typographical inconsistencies (e.g., “LLaV A‑Tri by pretraining LLaV A” → “LLaVA‑Tri, pretrained on…”).  \n- Ensure references are consistent in style (some duplicates and capitalization issues).  \n- Improve figure legends for self‑containment, particularly Figs. 3–6.  \n- Include dataset sampling statistics by disease and modality in the main text or supplement for quick reference.  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** — The work has high potential impact as an infrastructure and methodology paper but requires stronger demonstration of data quality assurance, clearer ethical governance, and more explicit methodological framing to reach IEEE TMI standards.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n\n---\n\n**Guidance Summary**  \nTo reach TMI publishability, the authors should:  \n- Strengthen reproducibility and ethics documentation,  \n- Substantiate annotation validity with larger expert review,  \n- Emphasize methodological advances (automation framework, retrieval–generation coupling) rather than purely dataset scale.  \nWith these refinements, the paper could represent a valuable contribution to medical imaging data methodology.",

The authors develop an automated pipeline that generates multigranular annotations without requiring paired text descriptions, using metadata integration, ROI localization via expert models, medical knowledge retrieval, and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for text generation. The resulting dataset provides structured descriptions covering five attributes: modality, organ detection, ROI analysis, lesion texture, and region-wise correlations. To demonstrate effectiveness, they propose LLaVA-Tri, achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD (81.6%), SLAKE (87.8%), and PathVQA (82.8%) benchmarks. The dataset aims to support various medical AI tasks including captioning, report generation, classification, and segmentation.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical and Technical Formulation Gaps**\n  - The paper lacks mathematical formalization of the ROI localization process and coordinate system transformations mentioned in Section 3.2.1, making reproducibility difficult\n  - No quantitative metrics are provided for the \"left-right reversal in image representation\" for X-ray and MRI modalities (Section 3.2.1, Figure 6)\n  - The vector similarity search methodology using Med-CPT encoder and Faiss indexing lacks technical specifications such as distance metrics, dimensionality, and retrieval thresholds (Section 3.2.1)\n\n• **Insufficient Evaluation Methodology**\n  - The quality evaluation relies on only 200 samples from a 25M dataset (Table 2), representing 0.0008% coverage, which may not be statistically representative\n  - Expert evaluation methodology lacks details about evaluator qualifications, inter-rater agreement, or evaluation protocols (Section 3.3)\n  - No comparison with human-generated descriptions or established medical text quality metrics beyond word count (Figure 8d)\n\n• **Dataset Construction Pipeline Reliability**\n  - Heavy dependence on metadata extraction from diverse sources (30+ datasets) without validation of metadata accuracy or consistency across sources (Section 3.2.1, Table 5)\n  - The automated ROI generation using different expert models for different modalities (Table 6) lacks cross-validation or quality assessment\n  - LLaVA-Medcap training details are relegated to appendix, yet this model generates all 25M descriptions, raising concerns about potential systematic biases\n\n• **Limited Experimental Validation**\n  - Evaluation restricted to three VQA benchmarks without testing on other medical tasks like classification, segmentation, or report generation despite claims of broad applicability (Abstract, Section 5)\n  - Ablation studies focus only on presence/absence of MedTrinity-25M pretraining without analyzing individual pipeline components' contributions\n  - No analysis of how multigranular annotations specifically contribute to performance improvements compared to simpler annotation schemes\n\n• **Scalability and Reproducibility Concerns**\n  - The pipeline's computational requirements, processing time, and resource costs for generating 25M descriptions are not reported, limiting practical adoption assessment\n  - No direct evidence found in the manuscript regarding the availability timeline or access procedures for the dataset despite public availability claims\n  - Quality control mechanisms for detecting and correcting errors in automated annotation generation are not described\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance Mathematical and Technical Documentation**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definitions for ROI coordinate transformations and localization algorithms, including pseudocode for the pipeline components\n  - Specify technical parameters for vector similarity search including distance metrics, embedding dimensions, and retrieval confidence thresholds\n  - Include detailed algorithmic descriptions of the metadata integration process with validation procedures\n\n• **Strengthen Evaluation Framework**\n  - Expand quality evaluation to at least 1000-2000 samples (0.004-0.008% of dataset) with stratified sampling across modalities and disease types\n  - Implement comprehensive inter-rater agreement studies with multiple medical experts and provide detailed evaluator qualification criteria\n  - Compare generated descriptions against human-written references using established medical text quality metrics such as medical concept coverage and clinical accuracy\n\n• **Improve Pipeline Validation and Transparency**\n  - Implement cross-validation procedures for metadata accuracy across the 30+ source datasets with systematic quality checks\n  - Provide comprehensive quality assessment of ROI generation across different expert models including precision/recall metrics\n  - Move LLaVA-Medcap training details to main paper and include systematic bias analysis of generated descriptions\n\n• **Expand Experimental Scope**\n  - Evaluate MedTrinity-25M on medical classification, segmentation, and report generation tasks beyond VQA to validate broad applicability claims\n  - Conduct detailed ablation studies analyzing individual pipeline components (metadata integration, ROI localization, knowledge retrieval) contributions\n  - Compare multigranular annotations against simpler annotation schemes to demonstrate specific value of the proposed approach\n\n• **Address Practical Implementation Issues**\n  - Report computational requirements, processing times, and estimated costs for dataset generation to enable practical adoption assessment\n  - Provide concrete dataset access procedures, file formats, and expected availability timeline with reproducibility guidelines\n  -

The dataset is notable for its automated pipeline, which generates multigranular annotations without requiring paired text descriptions. The authors argue that MedTrinity-25M can significantly advance multimodal medical AI models, as evidenced by the superior performance of LLaV A-Tri on three external VQA benchmarks. The paper is well-written, and the motivation for automating the generation of rich annotations is compelling.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The automation of multigranular annotation generation is a significant contribution. However, the manuscript could better situate its contributions relative to existing automated annotation pipelines and multimodal datasets. The authors should clarify how their approach differs from and improves upon recent advancements in automated medical image annotation.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily based on the performance of LLaV A-Tri on three VQA benchmarks. While these benchmarks are relevant, the manuscript could benefit from additional validation on other types of medical tasks, such as segmentation or classification, to better demonstrate the versatility of MedTrinity-25M. Additionally, the inclusion of a comparison with other datasets in terms of performance and annotation richness would strengthen the argument for the dataset's superiority.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript should include comparisons with recent datasets and models that have achieved state-of-the-art performance in similar tasks. The omission of relevant baselines, such as those from recent papers on multimodal medical AI, undermines the robustness of the experimental section. Including these comparisons would provide a clearer picture of how MedTrinity-25M stands out.\n\n4. Reproducibility: While the authors state that the dataset is publicly available, the manuscript lacks detailed instructions on how to reproduce the pipeline for generating annotations. Providing a clear, step-by-step guide for replicating the dataset creation process would enhance the reproducibility and utility of MedTrinity-25M.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figure 1: The comparison between MedTrinity-25M and other datasets could be more visually intuitive. Consider adding a table or a diagram that highlights the differences in annotation types and richness.\n2. Section 3.1: The description of the data triplet could benefit from a clearer breakdown of the components (image, ROI, and description) and their roles.\n3. Appendix B: The quantitative comparison between GPT-4V and LLaV A-Medcap could be supplemented with more qualitative examples to illustrate the differences in the generated descriptions.\n4. Typographical Issues: There are a few typographical errors throughout the manuscript, such as \"interleave\" instead of \"interleaved\" and inconsistent spacing in tables.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical imaging by introducing MedTrinity-25M, a large-scale multimodal dataset with rich annotations. The dataset's automated pipeline for generating multigranular annotations represents a meaningful innovation. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited, focusing primarily on VQA benchmarks, and could benefit from additional validation on other tasks. The manuscript also needs to better contextualize its contributions relative to existing work. The reproducibility of the dataset creation process is another area that requires more detailed documentation. Overall, while the idea is promising, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, strengthen validation across different medical tasks, and provide detailed methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

We show that image perturbations generated by these models can enhance the ability of humans to accurately report the ground truth class. Furthermore, we find that the same models can also be used out-of-the-box to predict the proportion of correct human responses to individual images, providing a simple, human-aligned estimator of the relative difficulty of each image. Motivated by these observations, we propose to augment visual learning in humans in a way that improves human categorization accuracy at test time. Our learning augmentation approach consists of (i) selecting images based on their model-estimated recognition difficulty, and (ii) applying image perturbations that aid recognition for novice learners. We find that combining these model-based strategies leads to categorization accuracy gains of 33-72% relative to control subjects without these interventions, on unmodified, randomly selected held-out test images. Beyond the accuracy gain, the training time for the augmented learning group was also shortened by 20-23%, despite both groups completing the same number of training trials. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a fine-grained categorization task with natural images, as well as two tasks in clinically relevant image domains - histology and dermoscopy - where visual learning is notoriously challenging. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first application of artificial neural networks to increase visual learning performance in humans by enhancing category-specific image features.",

By selecting challenging images and amplifying category-specific features, L-WISE improves human categorization accuracy by 33-72% and reduces training time by 20-23% across both general and clinical domains (e.g., dermoscopy and histology). The authors also discuss ethical implications, emphasizing the benefits of enhanced medical training and cautioning against potential biases that may arise from reliance on model-derived guidance.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The application of Robustified ANNs for improving human visual performance on image categorization seems like an interesting avenue. \n2. L-Wise empirically demonstrate gains in categorization accuracy and training efficiency. \n3. The paper addresses ethics concerns. Since the work mentions use of clinical data ethics discussion is of critical importance.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The paper focused on the performance of ventral stream. But we know that the human visual stream has a dorsal stream (where) that locates an object and the ventral stream (what) stream. And the interplay of these two streams forms the basis of human visual system. In this work the authors mainly focused on the ventral stream. From only quantified data, we can see the gains but it is very hard to trace this back to the nuanced perturbations the ANN produces. Hence, the suggestion is to use human gaze. The human gaze will precisely pin-point the \"where\" aspect and then will truly help us understand if at all the model perturbations are helping improve human performance. Can the authors please explain this? \n2. A robust DNN actually has worse performance on nominal data points. Data points that have not been corrupted adversarially. What was the motivation of the authors to select such a model for their experiments? \n3. The perturbations -  The perturbations if I am not mistaken are very subtle ones. For fine grained classifications, humans do follow curriculum learning but learning structures gradually from simpler to harder concepts. No experiments have shown this. It would be great if the authors can provide some empirical results/ explanation that can explain how will their method occur when you focus on structural cues rather than model perturbations that will benefit fine grained categorization. \n4. I am providing some citations related to Gaze and dual stream hypothesis that can help authors clarify my concerns \n\na.

Literature related to papers accepted in NeurIPS Gaze Meets ML workshop. That workshop accepted papers will provide intuition of how human gaze can be used in coherence with DL models.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. For model perturbations, can the authors please provide heat maps or any qualitative results that will help us track the ANN perturbations to human visual learning? \n2. Is there a way to show if the study scales/generalizes to other ANNs as well other than Adversarially trained ones? Since human subjects have been used here, I am not sure how feasible experiments will be. This can be a general neural network or a network trained by the CutMix [a] loss that provides robustness benefits as well. \n3. I feel generating perturbations based of dual stream networks and then using human gaze to track these will be a much stronger claim to the work. Can the authors please address this question? \n4. What about adversarially trained transformers? The attention maps are different from CNN feature maps. How will the study be applicable for perturbations based of a transformer backbone? \n5.

Understanding the interplay between these streams is essential. The authors should incorporate human gaze metrics to elucidate the effects of ANN perturbations on human performance.\n2. The authors' choice of a robust deep neural network (DNN) warrants clarification, as such models may perform poorly on unperturbed nominal data. What was the rationale for selecting this model for experiments?\n3. The subtlety of the applied perturbations is intriguing, yet the paper lacks empirical evidence demonstrating how these perturbations align with the principles of curriculum learning, which advocates for gradually progressing from simpler to more complex concepts. Additional empirical results supporting the methodology would strengthen the argument.\n4. Relevant citations concerning gaze and the dual stream hypothesis are suggested to clarify concerns:\n   - \"A Dual-Stream Neural Network Explains the Functional Segregation of Dorsal and Ventral Visual Pathways in Human Brains,\" NeurIPS 2023.\n   - Works from the NeurIPS Gaze Meets ML workshop that provide insights into integrating human gaze with deep learning models.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- Consider providing qualitative results, such as heat maps, to illustrate how ANN perturbations correlate with human visual learning.\n- Discuss the generalizability of the findings to other neural network architectures beyond adversarially trained ones. Given the involvement of human subjects, the feasibility of such experiments may be limited.\n- It may be beneficial to explore perturbations based on dual stream networks and use human gaze tracking to support the framework's claims.\n- Address how adversarially trained transformers could yield different attention maps compared to CNNs and the implications for perturbation applications.\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nThe study's significance lies in its innovative approach to enhancing human visual categorization through adversarially robust ANNs.

By emphasizing challenging images and amplifying category-specific features, the method reportedly improves human categorization accuracy (33–72%) and reduces training time (20–23%) across general and clinical domains such as dermoscopy and histology. The authors also include a thoughtful discussion on ethical considerations in clinical training contexts. Overall, the paper tackles an interesting problem, though several methodological and conceptual aspects require clarification.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Biological plausibility and dual-stream modeling:** The study focuses on the ventral (object-identification) pathway of human vision, while neglecting the dorsal (spatial-localization) stream. Since the interplay between these streams underlies human visual processing, the exclusive focus on the ventral stream limits interpretability. The reviewer suggests incorporating or discussing human gaze data to connect model perturbations with spatial attention, thereby better explaining how perturbations enhance human performance.  \n2. **Choice of adversarially trained models:** Robust DNNs are known to underperform on nominal (non-adversarial) data. The rationale for selecting such models for the presented experiments should be explicitly justified.  \n3. **Perturbation design and curriculum learning:** The perturbations appear subtle. In fine-grained categorization, humans often benefit from structured or curriculum-based learning that progresses from simple to complex concepts. It would strengthen the study to include experiments or explanations exploring how L-WISE compares or aligns with such structural learning approaches.  \n4. **Generalization and alternative architectures:** Clarification is needed on whether the method generalizes beyond adversarially trained ANNs, for example to standard networks or those trained with alternative robustness methods (e.g., CutMix). Additionally, implications for transformer-based architectures with attention maps distinct from CNN feature maps should be addressed.  \n5. **Qualitative visualization:** Please provide qualitative evidence, such as heat maps, illustrating how perturbations relate to human learning effects.  \n6. **Ethics and gaze-related literature:** The reviewer recommends consulting dual-stream and gaze-related literature (e.g., NeurIPS 2023 “Dual-Stream Neural Network” and the “Gaze Meets ML” workshop) for theoretical and empirical grounding.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Minor editorial and clarity improvements are suggested to improve presentation, such as brief explanations of technical terms and consistent use of acronyms.  \n- Ethical discussion is appreciated and appropriately placed; ensure data-handling descriptions meet responsible research standards.\n\n---\n\n**Summary (TMI Criteria)**  \nThe paper addresses a **significant** question—improving human learning through model-guided visual perturbations—but its **innovation** is somewhat constrained by limited theoretical grounding in the full visual processing model. The **evaluation** demonstrates quantitative benefits but lacks qualitative linkage to cognitive mechanisms like gaze or spatial attention. **Reproducibility** is moderately supported but would benefit from added experimental detail and visualizations.

First, the authors select images to present to novice learners based on a model’s estimated recognition difficulty for each image. Next, they apply image perturbations intended to aid recognition for novice learners. The authors conduct experiment on the three benchmark datasets, including the natural image and the clinical image to verify the effectiveness of their proposal.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. This paper is well-motivated, and a decent amount of technical details are given.\n2. The idea of improving the categorization performance of the novice learner by leveraging the capacity of the robustified artificial neural network is both interesting and practical.\n3. The reported improvement in novice learners' performance is notable, with gains in both test accuracy and reduced training time.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The establishment of the empirical observations is somewhat unconvincing. Do these observations hold in more complex classification tasks or when applied to medical imaging?\n2. The related work section lacks discussion of both the machine teaching and human-machine vision alignment methods.\n3. The size of the particants is somewhat small. \n4. The perception of enhanced images may be altered due to perturbations.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. The empirical observations are derived from a 16-way animal categorization task on natural images, which seems somewhat simplistic. It would be valuable to examine how these observations hold up in more complex categorization tasks or with different types of images, especially medical images. Given the typically limited availability of medical images, the proposed method could have promising applications in the medical imaging field.\n\n2. Beyond the empirical observations, is there any physiological insight or analysis on why the proposed model-based selection and enhancement method could improve novice learners’ performance in categorization tasks?\n\n3. The authors do not discuss the related machine teaching literature. An in-depth comparison with machine teaching methods, particularly with \"Teaching Categories to Human Learners with Visual Explanations\" (CVPR 2018), would be valuable. This work similarly considers image difficulty; an introduction and comparison with it are beneficial.\n\n4. The authors should also discuss the connection to human-machine vision alignment methods, such as \"Harmonizing the Object Recognition Strategies of Deep Neural Networks with Humans\" (NeurIPS 2022).\n\n5. The sample size of participants is relatively small, and expanding the participant pool is recommended to enhance the reliability of the results; also, recruiting participants from diverse backgrounds would improve the generalizability of the findings. If expanding the participant pool is impractical due to time or budget constraints, performing a power analysis or discussing effect sizes could help strengthen the reliability of the analysis.\n\n6. When using perturbations to enhance images, how does the method ensure that essential image details remain unchanged, particularly when using a large ϵ (e.g., 20)? This concern is especially pertinent for medical images, where even slight pixel changes may alter critical information. I recommend involving medical experts to review the enhanced images or using quantitative similarity measures (such as SSIM or FSIM) to verify that essential details are preserved.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 3",

These goals fall closer to human–machine interaction or cognitive vision than to core TMI topics (e.g., image formation, quantitative biomarkers, or clinical imaging pipelines). The contribution is therefore *marginally relevant* to TMI’s methodological orientation.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level – Moderate**  \n   The concept of using robustified ANNs to both estimate human recognition difficulty and generate category‑specific perturbations to aid learning is novel in the context of perceptual augmentation. The combination of difficulty‑weighted image selection and enhancement (“L‑WISE”) is an original integration. However, within medical imaging, the methodological novelty is indirect: the work shows utility of an existing robust adversarial training framework rather than introducing a new imaging algorithm.  \n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor – Generally strong, with caveats**  \n   • Clear explanation of model training, datasets (HAM10000, MHIST, moth data), and subject recruitment.  \n   • Multiple ablation and cross‑domain validations reinforce internal consistency.  \n   • The human‑subject experiments are well powered for behavioral analysis, not for clinical validation.  \n   • No quantitative evaluation against radiologist performance or diagnostic endpoints—hence limited medical imaging rigor.  \n   • Statistical treatment (χ² tests, bootstrapped CIs, logistic regressions) is appropriate.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation – Excellent**  \n   Manuscript is well structured, well illustrated, and grammatically polished. Figures are clear and annotated; methods and appendices provide reproducibility details.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance – Adequate**  \n   IRB approval, informed consent, fair participant compensation, and code availability are indicated. The authors discuss dataset biases (e.g., skin‑tone imbalance in HAM10000) responsibly.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \n   The authors propose *Logit‑Weighted Image Selection and Enhancement* (L‑WISE), a model‑based method to accelerate and improve human visual category learning. Using adversarially trained (“robustified”) neural networks, they (a) predict each image’s recognition difficulty for humans from the ground‑truth logit output, and (b) apply pixel‑bounded perturbations that highlight class‑specific features. These signals define an adaptive curriculum of progressively harder images and fading enhancement strength. Human participants trained with L‑WISE attained 33–72 % higher test‑phase accuracy and ~20 % shorter training duration across natural, dermoscopy, and histology images.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n   • Creative cross‑disciplinary idea linking adversarial robustness to human perceptual learning.  \n   • Extensive behavioral validation with >500 participants.  \n   • Strong statistical analysis and reproducibility documentation.  \n   • Ethical and bias awareness sections are exemplary.  \n   • Potential relevance for educational tools in pathology and dermatology training.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n   • The methodological innovation pertains to **human learning augmentation**, not directly to **medical imaging methodology** as defined by TMI.  \n   • The medical tasks used are illustrative small‑scale classification problems; no evidence of translation to clinical diagnostic improvement.  \n   • Enhancement mechanism is largely heuristic—no formal modeling of perceptual or imaging physics.  \n   • The perturbations may distort image realism; risk of misleading visual cues is insufficiently quantified.  \n   • Sparse comparison with existing curriculum‑learning or active‑learning frameworks in medical imaging.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n   1. **Clarify TMI relevance.** The paper should explicitly discuss how L‑WISE contributes to *medical imaging science* beyond cognitive training—for instance, could similar methodology optimize annotation, reader training, or quality control in radiology workflows?  \n   2. **Quantify perturbation realism.** Provide perceptual or image‑quality metrics (e.g., SSIM, color fidelity) on medical data to ensure that enhancements do not produce artificial or non‑physiologic appearances.  \n   3. **Ablation within clinical tasks.** The ablation study is mainly on natural or dermoscopy data; it would strengthen the translational argument to repeat at least one ablation in histology.  \n   4. **Statistical generalization.** Randomization and participant pooling across experiments should be formalized—report per‑subject variance and number of images per condition.  \n   5. **Potential biases.** Include quantitative assessment of whether perturbations exacerbate known dataset biases (e.g., skin tone).  \n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n   • Correct occasional typographical issues (“robustu‑fied”, “precariousness”).  \n   • Provide actual number of images per class and dataset partition in main text rather than only in appendix.  \n   • Clarify computational cost for generating perturbations and whether code supports GPU inference.  \n   • Suggest renaming sections on “histology—malignant vs benign” to specify true class labels (hyperplastic polyp vs sessile serrated adenoma).  \n   • Ensure all figures use consistent font sizes and color legends.\n\n6. **Overall Recommendation** – **Reject (Out of Scope / Low Novelty for TMI)**  \n   The study is methodologically careful and creative, but its primary focus—augmenting human visual learning via robustified networks—is outside the central scope of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*, which prioritizes new imaging or analytic methodologies rather than cognitive‑training paradigms. A venue emphasizing human–AI interaction, neuro‑inspired vision, or medical education technology (e.g., *IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems* or *Frontiers in Digital Health*) would be a better fit.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n   High confidence in assessment of scientific quality and scope alignment; moderate uncertainty about editorial policy boundaries.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nInnovative and well‑executed behavioral research with interesting implications for visual training, but its contributions lie more in human–machine perceptual alignment than in the methodological advancement of medical imaging. Recommend rejection for TMI due to limited scope fit, while encouraging submission to a journal focused on human–AI perception or educational applications.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents L-WISE (Logit-Weighted Image Selection and Enhancement), a method that uses robustified artificial neural networks to augment human visual category learning. The authors establish that ground truth logit values from adversarially-trained models can predict human image recognition difficulty (Figure 1A) and that perturbations maximizing these logits enhance human categorization accuracy (Figure 1B). L-WISE combines two strategies: (1) selecting training images based on model-estimated difficulty with gradually increasing complexity, and (2) applying image enhancements that decrease over time (Figure 2). The method was tested across three domains: moth species classification, dermoscopy lesion classification, and histology tissue classification. Results show 33-72% relative accuracy gains above chance on unmodified test images compared to controls, while reducing training time by 20-23% (Figure 4A). Ablation studies indicate both image selection and enhancement contribute to performance improvements (Table 1).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Limited Mathematical Foundation for Enhancement Optimization** \n  - Equation 1 lacks theoretical justification for the choice of α parameter and its relationship to enhancement effectiveness, with α set to different values (0 for ImageNet, 1 for fine-grained tasks) without principled reasoning\n  - The projection operation in Equation 2 uses a simple L2 constraint but no analysis is provided on why this norm is optimal for human perception compared to other constraint formulations\n  - The step size η and number of steps formula (ceil(2ϵ) for ResNet-50, ceil(4ϵ) for XCiT) appear ad-hoc without convergence analysis or theoretical grounding (Page 10, Appendix S1)\n\n• **Insufficient Statistical Power and Multiple Comparisons Control**\n  - Sample sizes of ~30 participants per condition (Page 10) may be inadequate for detecting meaningful effect sizes, particularly for class-specific analyses where the authors acknowledge being \"statistically underpowered\" (Page 26)\n  - No correction for multiple comparisons is applied across the numerous statistical tests performed, including comparisons between conditions in Table 1 and across different image domains\n  - The logistic regression analysis in Figure 1A pools data from different experimental conditions without accounting for potential confounding factors or participant-level random effects\n\n• **Questionable Generalizability of Enhancement Schedules**\n  - The enhancement schedules (exponential tapering from ε=8, difficulty selection increasing by 0.15 per block) were not optimized systematically and appear to be based on limited pilot testing (Page 10, Figure S12H-M)\n  -

However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a new self-supervised learning-based denoising method for diffusion MRI (dMRI). The proposed method leveraged the diffusion modeling concept, but instead of training a diffusion model with “clean images” as x_0 and noise as x_T, it utilized two diffusion weighted images (DWIs) with different diffusion encodings at both ends of a “diffusion-like” process. A denoising network was trained by predicting one DWI using a linear combination of two DWIs and an added noise term. The linear combination coefficients are time-dependent and determined via a scheduling strategy similar to training a diffusion model. The network was then used for a conditional sampling step for generating the final denoised images. The idea to utilize images acquired with different diffusion encodings to denoise one of them is interesting and the training strategy is an interesting approach to leverage the diffusion modeling concept, especially with training only latter diffusion steps to reduce hallucinations. However, several key assumptions made are questionable and the overall methodology and presentation lacks clarity. Evaluation using only dMRI signal model goodness of fit is limited and can be biased. There are a few overstatements that can mislead the readers. Detailed comments can be found below.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nA diffusion-like modeling that learns the relationship between two DWI volumes with different diffusion encodings to denoise one or each other.\n\nTraining only later step diffusion to avoid hallucination\n\nA fusion strategy that exploits linear combination of two DWIs with different contrasts with time-dependent coefficients and iterative refinement.\n\nExtensive evaluations using both simulations that exactly followed the assumptions for the proposed methodology and practical magnitude DWI data.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThere are statements that can be misleading in the context of MR physics (aka domain knowledge). For example, \"the noise predominantly originates from physical interferences (Fadnavis et al., 2020a)\". This statement about physical interferences is  both vague and inaccurate. This work is dealing with thermal noise or noise resulting from thermal noise in the measurements, which is not really physical interferences depending on how ones interpret them. Another example, \"Different clinical applications require varying numbers of diffusion vectors and acquisition strategies, which makes modeling the noise distribution and further implementing denoising techniques challenging\". Acquiring DWIs with varying numbers of diffusion vectors had nothing to do with the difficulty of  modeling noise distribution.\n\nMany key assumptions for the proposed method was built on do not hold which made the theoretical/mathematical foundations questionable, e.g.,\na) It seems that the authors assumed DWIs acquired with different diffusion encodings had the same underlying “clean” image and were corrupted by independent noise. This is inaccurate. In fact, two DWIs can have rather different contrasts due to the diffusion encoding effects, e.g., different diffusion encoding directions. More specifically, x and x’ cannot be simply modeled as the same y plus different noise. What are the implications of this assumption not met?\n\nb) Line 111: The authors claimed that that the proposed method does not require an explicit noise model. This is an overstatement. The J-invariance assumption, which formed the basis of the training objective in Eq. (9) implicitly requires that the noise distribution be zero-means and conditionally independent. Furthermore, additive noise model was assumed, x = y + n1 (Line 200). In dMRI, the magnitude images with higher b-values (stronger diffusion weightings) can have lower SNR for which additive noise may not hold. These need to be clarified.\n\n-  Overall, the presentation lacks clarity and there seem to be some concerning inaccuracies.\na) The linear combination relationship claimed in Section 3.1 does not seem accurate. I checked the derivation. Eq. 31 is correct which is known (so this is not a contribution of the authors), but I'm not sure about going from Eq. 31 to 32 as F_theta predicts x_0, but they are not equal, and there is also an additional term of sigma_t^2*z. Therefore, I don't think it's a correct statement to say x_(t-1) is a linear interpolation between x_out and x_t. But is this really needed for the proposed method? I really don’t see a connection between what’s argued theoretically and what’s actually being implemented.\n\nb) There are a few other inaccurate mathematical statements and notations which are confusing. For example, Eq. 7, the left side has q(x1:T |xt*) which is a joint distribution for x1 to xT, and the right side is a Gaussian distribution for xt. \nOn Line 160: {xt}1:T was described as”obtained from the reverse process.” However, in\nFigure 1 and on the right side of Equation (7) on Line 186, it appears that xt is a corrupted version of xt*.  This interpretation, along with the notation in the Fig. 1, implies that {xt}1:T would represent a forward process. It appears to this reviewer the authors had not been using a consistent definition of forward and reverse diffusion which made the overall description rather confusing. These are just examples of inconsistencies found.\n\nc) According to the J-invariance property, the noise should ideally have zero mean\nand be conditionally independent of the target output. This requirement is necessary to ensure that the expected loss for self-supervised training asymptotical approaching the supervised loss. However, the input to F(.) in Eq. (9) includes xt*, which is a linear combination of x and x’ (Eq. (6)). Given that x serves as the supervision signal for the loss, this implies a correlation between the input x∗t and the target x, which would violate the conditional independence requirement for J-invariance.\n\n### Questions\n\nIn Eq. (5) on Line 155, the authors highlighted a specific term as the ”major difference” between xt−1 and x^bar_t−1. Could the authors clarify why this particular term is considered the primary source of difference? Furthermore, can the authors elaborate on the underlying reason(s) for the “drift” in the model and how it emerges during the reverse diffusion process?\n\nAccording to the definition of the Fusion process in Eq. (6)  and the “forward process” in Eq. (7), it appears that the starting point for the forward process changes based on t, as x_t* is dependent on t. This dependence implies that the Fusion process dynamically adjusts the starting point of the forward process at each step, which is unconventional compared to typical diffusion models. Could the authors clarify the rationale behind this design?\n\nOther more recent self-supervised denoising methods should be compared, if not for all, e.g., Noise2Score and Recorrupted2Recorrupted etc.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

While the concept of leveraging different diffusion encodings is intriguing and offers a fresh perspective on denoising, several key assumptions in the methodology raise questions about its clarity and validity.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. **Questionable Assumptions**: The theoretical foundations seem flawed, as the authors assume that DWIs obtained with different encodings share the same underlying “clean” image and are affected by independent noise, which is inaccurate. Such an assumption leads to potential inaccuracies in the modeling.\n   \n2. **Clarity of Noise Model**: The claim that the method doesn't require an explicit noise model is overstated; the J-invariance assumption requires specific characteristics of the noise distribution that may not hold true in dMRI applications, particularly regarding additive noise constraints.\n   \n3. **Inconsistencies in Presentation**: Mathematical derivations, particularly from Eq. 31 to Eq. 32, lack foundational accuracy and clarity.

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript proposes a self‑supervised denoising framework for diffusion MRI (dMRI) that adapts the concept of diffusion modeling. Instead of training a standard diffusion model between clean and noisy data, the method uses two diffusion‑weighted images (DWIs) with different diffusion encodings at the ends of a “diffusion‑like” process. A neural network is trained to predict one DWI from a time‑dependent linear combination of the two DWIs with added noise, followed by a conditional sampling step for denoising. The idea of leveraging multiple diffusion encodings for denoising is interesting; however, the paper suffers from unclear formulation, questionable assumptions, and limited and potentially biased evaluation. Several statements are scientifically inaccurate or misleading, and the overall presentation lacks precision.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Questionable Assumptions:** The framework assumes that DWIs acquired with different diffusion encodings share the same underlying “clean” image with independent noise, which is physically inaccurate as DWIs can exhibit substantially different contrasts depending on encoding direction. The implications of this violated assumption are not addressed.  \n2. **Implicit Noise Model Dependence:** Although the authors claim the method does not require a noise model, the formulation inherently assumes additive, zero‑mean, and independent noise through the J‑invariance property. These assumptions may not hold for magnitude dMRI data with low SNR and should be clarified.  \n3. **Mathematical Inconsistencies:** Several equations (e.g., Eqs. 7, 31–32) and notations appear inconsistent or incorrect. The derivation of the linear interpolation relationship and the definitions of forward vs. reverse diffusion are unclear and inconsistent between text and figures.  \n4. **Violation of J‑Invariance Conditions:** The inclusion of \\(x_t^*\\), a linear combination of x and x′, as input while using x as supervision introduces correlation that violates the conditional independence requirement central to J‑invariance.  \n5. **Evaluation Limitations:** Performance is assessed only via dMRI signal model goodness‑of‑fit, which can be biased and insufficient to support general claims. Comparisons with more recent self‑supervised denoising methods (e.g., Noise2Score, Recorrupted2Recorrupted) are missing.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Some MR physics statements are inaccurate or misleading (e.g., mischaracterizing noise origins as “physical interferences”).  \n- Theoretical derivations and notation (particularly in Sections 3.1 and 3.2) need clearer, consistent explanations.  \n- Figures and equations should align in terms of symbol definitions.  \n- Typographical and clarity issues at specific line references (e.g., Lines 111, 155, 160, 186) should be corrected.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe paper addresses an important problem in dMRI denoising and offers an innovative adaptation of diffusion‑model training concepts in a self‑supervised context. However, the approach rests on debatable assumptions about DWI relationships and noise properties, undermining its theoretical soundness. Presentation and derivations contain inconsistencies that hinder reproducibility. Evaluation is limited and does not convincingly demonstrate practical benefits or generalizability. Overall, while the idea is creative, the manuscript requires substantial revision for soundness and clarity before it can meet standards of significance, innovation, evaluation, and reproducibility.  \n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**",

It integrates self‑supervised statistical denoising theory (Noise2Self) with diffusion probabilistic models, introducing a *Fusion process* to avoid sampling drift and a *Di‑process* to estimate data‑dependent noise. Training focuses on latter diffusion steps for stable learning, while inference applies an adaptive “Run–Walk” sampling and adjustable stopping criterion to control denoising strength. Tested on multiple public datasets and simulations, Di‑Fusion yields higher SNR/CNR, improved tractography coherence, and better microstructure fitting (CSD/DTI R²) than existing denoisers (Patch2Self, DDM2, etc.).\n\n### 2. Strengths\n- **Methodological novelty:** Combines self‑supervision, adaptive diffusion sampling, and real‑noise modeling in a unified single‑stage framework.  \n- **Technical rigor:** Mathematical derivations, algorithmic clarity, and ablation studies identify each component’s role.  \n- **Robust validation:** Evaluations across in‑vivo and simulated data; clinical impact examined through tractography and DTI metrics.  \n- **Open‑source release** enhances transparency and reproducibility.\n\n### 3. Weaknesses\n- The theoretical justification of stability improvements (e.g., training only latter steps) is largely empirical.  \n- Quantitative uncertainty or statistical significance of performance gains is missing.  \n- Heavy notation and supplementary length reduce accessibility.  \n- Practical runtime issues remain: diffusion models are computationally intensive, and inference time, though mitigated, may limit clinical use.\n\n### 4. Major Comments\n1. **Quantitative support for stability claims:**  \n   Provide statistical variance or confidence intervals across multiple subjects/runs to confirm stability improvements from latter‑step training.\n2. **Complexity and runtime:**  \n   Report detailed training/inference time compared to DDM2 and classical methods; discuss feasibility for clinical pipelines.\n3. **Ablation depth:**  \n   Current ablations are qualitative; include numerical metrics (PSNR/SSIM/SNR) for each component removal.\n4. **Notation clarity:**  \n   Streamline notation in Sections 3.1–3.3 to enhance readability; summarize equations in a table or schematic.\n5. **Clinical translation:**  \n   Elaborate on how parameter tuning (e.g., CSNR threshold) could be standardized for routine deployment.\n\n### 5. Minor Comments\n- Fix minor typos (“Di-” sometimes written inconsistently, spacing before figures).  \n- When referencing appendices, denote key equations in main text more clearly.  \n- Improve figure captions (especially Fig. 1) for self‑contained explanation.  \n- Confirm that all datasets cite proper usage licenses and IRB waivers.\n\n### 6.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces Di-Fusion, a self-supervised denoising method for diffusion MRI (dMRI) that leverages diffusion probabilistic models without requiring clean training data. The method addresses three key challenges: (1) a \"Fusion process\" that creates linear interpolations between noisy volumes to avoid drift during sampling, (2) a \"Di-\" process that characterizes real-world noise using differences between independent noisy measurements, and (3) training only the latter diffusion steps (Tc ≤ T) to reduce generative diversity and improve stability. The approach enables adaptive sampling termination based on a controllable SNR threshold (CSNR). Experiments on three dMRI datasets (Stanford HARDI, Sherbrooke 3-Shell, PPMI) and simulated data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks including tractography, microstructure modeling, and DTI fitting compared to methods like DDM2, Patch2Self, and traditional approaches.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - Equation (5) introduces notation ¯xt−1 without clear definition until much later in the text (Section 3.1), creating confusion about the relationship between different trajectory sets {xt} and {¯xt}\n  - The \"mess(·)\" operation in Equation (8) is defined only as \"spatial shuffling\" without mathematical rigor, yet it's critical for the noise characterization claim\n  - Appendix C.1 derivations contain algebraic steps that appear to conflate different probability distributions without proper justification for substituting x∗t in place of x′\n\n• **Insufficient theoretical justification for key design choices**\n  - The claim that training only latter diffusion steps (Tc = 300) reduces \"diverse generative capabilities\" lacks theoretical grounding beyond intuitive explanations (Section 3.2)\n  - No formal analysis of why the Fusion process mathematically prevents drift, despite this being a central contribution (Section 3.1, Figure 1a)\n  - The variance preservation claim for ξx−x′ in Appendix C.2 assumes independence that may not hold in practice for dMRI noise\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - Competing methods use different architectures while claiming \"fair comparison\" - only DDM2, Nr2N, and DIP adopt Di-Fusion's U-Net architecture (Appendix D.1)\n  - The primary evaluation metric (R² for microstructure fitting, Table S2) shows marginal improvements (0.967 vs 0.959 for Nr2N in CSD-CC) that may not be clinically significant\n  - Simulated experiments (Table 1) show high standard deviations for DDM2 and Nr2N but not for Di-Fusion, suggesting potential implementation or hyperparameter optimization bias\n\n• **Limited scope and generalizability concerns**\n  - Method requires specific dMRI acquisition with adjacent volume pairs (j and j-1), which may not be available in many clinical protocols\n  - Noise model assumptions explicitly target only additive Gaussian thermal noise, excluding physiological artifacts common in real dMRI (Section 5, limitations)\n  - Computational overhead of diffusion model sampling (5+ hours training, Section D.1) limits practical clinical adoption compared to methods like Patch2Self\n\n• **Presentation and reproducibility issues**\n  - Critical implementation details scattered across appendices make reproduction difficult (noise schedule in D.1, hyperparameters in multiple sections)\n  - Figure quality issues with small text and overlapping elements in Figure 2 and supplementary figures\n  - Inconsistent notation switching between Fθ and F without subscripts throughout equations\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and presentation clarity**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definition of the \"mess(·)\" operation with properties and theoretical justification for variance preservation\n  - Reorganize Section 3.1 to define all trajectory notations (xt, ¯xt, x∗t) upfront before presenting equations\n  - Include rigorous proofs for drift prevention claims and theoretical analysis of why latter-step training reduces generative capacity\n\n• **Strengthen theoretical foundations with formal analysis**\n  - Develop theoretical framework explaining why Tc = 300 is optimal, including analysis of training stability vs. generative capacity trade-offs\n  - Provide mathematical proof that the Fusion process prevents drift under stated assumptions\n  - Analyze conditions under which independence assumptions for noise hold in real dMRI scenarios\n\n• **Improve experimental rigor and fairness**\n  - Implement all competing methods with identical U-Net architectures and report hyperparameter optimization procedures for fair comparison\n  - Include statistical significance testing for R² improvements and establish clinical significance thresholds\n  - Provide error bars and multiple runs for all methods in simulated experiments, not just selected ones\n\n• **Expand applicability and address limitations**\n  - Evaluate performance on datasets without adjacent volume pairs by developing alternative pairing strategies\n  - Extend noise model to handle physiological artifacts beyond additive Gaussian noise\n  - Compare computational efficiency more comprehensively, including memory requirements and inference time comparisons with all baselines\n\n• **Improve presentation and ensure reproducibility**\n  - Consolidate all implementation details into main paper or single appendix section with complete hyperparameter tables\n  - Enhance figure quality with larger fonts and clearer layouts, particularly Figure 2 and supplementary visualizations\n  - Standardize notation throughout and provide a symbols table for complex mathematical expressions",

    "abstract": "Do Large Vision Models (LVMs) extract medically and semantically relevant features similar to those identified by human experts? Currently, only biased, qualitative approaches with limited, small-scale expert evaluations are available to answer this question. In this study, we propose the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS), a novel method inspired by state space modeling, to evaluate the encoding space of LVMs from medical images using the encoding space of Large Language Models (LLMs) from medical reports. Through extensive experimentation on 32 datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas collection using five state-of-the-art LLMs, we first establish a baseline of LLMs' performance in digital pathology and show that LLMs' encoding can be linked to patient outcomes. Then, we compared seven LVMs with BSS and showed that LVMs suffer from poor semantic capability when compared with encoded expert knowledge from pathology reports.\nWe also found statistically significant correlations between BSS (as a measure of structural similarity) and performance in two downstream tasks: information retrieval and survival prediction tasks. Our study also investigates the consensus among LLMs in evaluating LVMs using BSS, indicating that LLMs generally reach substantial consensus in rating LVMs, with some variation dependant on the cancer type. We believe the BSS metric proposed here holds significant potential for application in other domains with similar contexts.

Additionally, the experiments show LLMs' capabilities in these two key tasks and provide a quantitative comparison of LLM consistency. This consistency further supports BSS as an effective metric for evaluating the semantic capabilities of LVMs.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1.The computational complexity of BSS may be high in practical applications, particularly when applied to large-scale datasets.\n2.While the experiments show strong performance of BSS in the information retrieval task, its correlation with survival prediction is weaker. This may indicate that BSS lacks robustness across different types of tasks, especially in more complex medical applications. Therefore, its effectiveness as a general semantic metric remains to be further validated.\n3.The experiments focus on the tasks of information retrieval and survival prediction, but these tasks may differ in nature from other potential tasks. The consistency of LLMs and the effectiveness of BSS in other semantic tasks require further experimental validation across a broader range of tasks.\n4.The paper focuses on evaluating the semantic capabilities of existing LVMs, but it lacks concrete suggestions on how to improve their semantic performance. Although the limitations of LVMs are highlighted, there is little discussion on how to optimize or modify their architectures to overcome these shortcomings.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.Could the authors suggest ways to optimize BSS for large-scale datasets, or clarify if any tests on smaller subsets were conducted for comparative analysis?\n2. Since BSS performs better on information retrieval than survival prediction, could the authors elaborate on the reasons for this difference? Is there evidence BSS might generalize to other medical tasks?\n3. The paper notes limitations in LVMs' semantic capabilities.

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI:**  \n✅ The manuscript sits squarely within the methodological scope of IEEE TMI. It introduces a new metric—**the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS)**—for evaluating large vision models (LVMs) by leveraging the embedding spaces of large language models (LLMs) applied to paired image–text data from medical pathology. The paper focuses on foundational mathematical formulation, algorithmic definition, and quantitative validation using large-scale medical datasets (TCGA), rather than an application case study. The contribution is methodological and generalizable to medical imaging domains.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level:**  \nModerate to high novelty. BSS introduces a formal probabilistic framework (based on Boltzmann factors and state-space analogy) for quantifying cross-modal semantic alignment between medical image and text embeddings. Unlike prior comparative studies of LVM–LLM correlations, this work defines a differentiable and theoretically motivated metric. The notion of “semantic similarity” between modalities grounded in energy-based modeling is new within medical imaging evaluation. The theoretical innovation is meaningful, though empirical validation still relies on standard dataset/architecture comparisons.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor:**  \nThe manuscript is strong in theoretical exposition, with clear equations and algorithmic outlines. Experimental design is extensive: five LLMs, seven LVMs, 32 TCGA cohorts, and two downstream tasks (retrieval and survival). The statistical methods (Pearson correlation tests, cross-validation, standard retrieval and survival evaluation metrics) are appropriate. Reproducibility is aided by public code and detailed appendices.  \nPotential gaps:  \n- The description of hyperparameters and data preprocessing, while extensive in the appendix, could still be summarized in the main text for clarity.  \n- Limited ablation on the sensitivity of BSS hyperparameters (e.g., *k* selection, influence of LLM choice).  \n- The baseline comparison to existing semantic or alignment metrics (e.g., CCA-based measures, mutual information) is missing.  \n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation:**  \nVery well organized and clearly written for a technically complex topic. Figures are numerous and generally informative. The mathematical narrative (from intuitive derivation to formal algorithm) is sound, though slightly dense in mid-section 3. Minor language and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., spacing, figure callouts). Overall readability is high.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance:**  \nDataset usage (public TCGA), de-identification, and preprocessing are transparently described. Code availability is promised. Ethical statements about patient privacy and bias are explicitly included in the appendix. The study meets TMI reproducibility and compliance expectations.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \nThe authors propose the **Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS)**, a theoretically derived cross-modal metric to evaluate the semantic alignment between visual features from large vision models (LVMs) and textual encodings from large language models (LLMs) in medical imaging. Using TCGA pathology images and reports, they validate BSS as a measure of semantic correspondence that correlates with downstream task performance (retrieval, survival prediction). The study argues that BSS provides a quantitative, scalable alternative to expert-based qualitative evaluations.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n- Clear methodological innovation linking statistical mechanics with multimodal embedding evaluation.  \n- Large-scale empirical validation across dozens of cancer datasets.  \n- Transparent code/data availability and detailed experiments.  \n- Conceptually bridges LLM-based reasoning with visual representation quality assessment in medicine.  \n- Potential extensibility beyond pathology to other imaging–text modalities.  \n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n- Limited comparative analysis with existing quantitative alignment metrics (e.g., cosine similarity baselines, cross-modal contrastive losses).  \n- The connection between BSS magnitude and specific model behaviors is descriptive rather than mechanistically analyzed.  \n- Writing occasionally conflates “semantic” with “clinical” relevance—clarify interpretability versus outcome prediction.  \n- Some figures (e.g., dense multipanel charts) could be simplified for readability.  \n- Statistical significance is shown for correlations but effect size interpretation is modest.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n- **Contextual Comparison:** Include comparison or discussion against established metrics for modality alignment (e.g., CCA, linear alignment, information-theoretic similarity), situating BSS within quantitative literature.  \n- **Sensitivity and Robustness:** Provide a brief ablation or analytic justification of the choice of *k* in neighborhood graphs and of the Boltzmann formulation constants.  \n- **Interpretability / Usability:** Discuss what a specific BSS value implies operationally—how practitioners might use it to compare or tune LVMs.  \n- **Generalization / Future Work:** Summarize in main text (not only appendix) how BSS could inform model training (e.g., as a loss), since this is important for TMI’s methodological emphasis.  \n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n- Correct minor typographical spacing (“LVMs,” “Boltzmann’s,” etc.).  \n- Improve axis labeling readability in Figs. 5–8.  \n- Condense the introduction by merging some background on foundation models.  \n- Ensure consistent citation formatting (some “et al.” listings inconsistent).  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.**  \nThe paper introduces an interesting and potentially impactful metric, with sound theory and strong experiments. However, to meet TMI’s threshold for methodological completeness, the authors should (a) include direct comparison with alternative semantic similarity metrics, (b) perform a limited ablation to confirm robustness, and (c) clarify interpretability and practical relevance. Addressing these points would elevate the contribution from exploratory to mature methodological advancement.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** **5 / 5** — reviewer is confident in evaluation given background in imaging–AI methodology.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Statement for Editors:**  \nThe submission offers a novel, theoretically grounded metric that could become a useful tool for assessing and aligning multimodal medical foundation models. It is methodologically innovative, scientifically rigorous, and well executed. With additional comparative and robustness analyses, it is likely to reach the publication standard of IEEE TMI.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces the Boltzmann Semantic Score (BSS), a novel metric to evaluate Large Vision Models (LVMs) using Large Language Models (LLMs) as semantic references. The method addresses the question of whether LVMs extract medically relevant features similar to human experts by comparing structural similarity between LVM and LLM embedding spaces. The authors first establish LLM baselines on 32 TCGA datasets using five state-of-the-art LLMs for information retrieval and survival prediction tasks. They then propose BSS, inspired by statistical mechanics and Boltzmann distributions, to measure semantic alignment between vision and text encodings. The method constructs k-nearest neighbor graphs in both modalities and computes semantic scores based on matching and non-matching states. Experiments on seven LVMs show generally low BSS values, indicating poor semantic capability. The authors demonstrate statistically significant correlations between BSS and downstream task performance, and show substantial consensus among LLMs in ranking LVMs using Cohen's kappa scores.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - The transition from Boltzmann factor in Equation 2 to the constant √d1 replacing kT lacks proper justification (Section 3.3, Page 5), making the physical analogy questionable\n  - The definition of sets A and D in Equations 4-5 (Page 5) contains unclear notation where Li = Lj relationships are not precisely defined\n  - Algorithm 1 (Page 19) lacks mathematical rigor in describing how \"corresponding nodes\" are identified in the observer graph\n  - The normalization in Equation 6 (Page 5) assumes non-zero denominators but provides no handling for edge cases\n\n• **Experimental design and validation limitations**\n  - BSS correlations with downstream tasks show high variability across datasets (Table 3a-3b, Page 9) with some non-significant results, questioning the metric's reliability\n  - The choice of k=5 neighbors (Figures 5-6, Pages 8-9) appears arbitrary with insufficient ablation studies on this critical hyperparameter\n  - Survival prediction experiments use only 8 cancer types (Table 2, Page 8) while information retrieval uses all 32, creating inconsistent evaluation scope\n  - The supervised pooling methodology using AbMIL (Section J.2, Page 19) introduces task-specific bias that may confound BSS measurements\n\n• **Methodological assumptions and theoretical foundation concerns**\n  - The fundamental assumption that LLM representations serve as ground truth for medical semantics lacks empirical validation beyond retrieval tasks (Section 3.1, Page 3)\n  - The physical analogy to statistical mechanics appears forced, with energy differences defined as L2 distances without theoretical justification (Equation 2, Page 5)\n  - The method assumes semantic similarity should correspond to spatial proximity in embedding spaces, which may not hold across different model architectures\n  - No comparison with existing semantic evaluation metrics or human expert validation is provided to establish BSS validity\n\n• **Reproducibility and generalization challenges**\n  - Critical implementation details for graph construction and nearest neighbor computation are missing from the main text\n  - The consensus analysis (Figure 7, Page 9) shows moderate agreement for some LLM pairs, suggesting potential inconsistencies in BSS computation\n  - Dataset-specific performance variations (Figures 5-6, Pages 8-9) raise questions about BSS generalizability across different medical domains\n  - The method's dependence on specific LLM architectures may limit its applicability as foundation models evolve\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen mathematical rigor and theoretical foundation**\n  - Provide rigorous justification for the choice of √d1 as the temperature equivalent, including sensitivity analysis across different dimensionalities\n  - Clarify the mathematical definition of matching states in sets A and D with explicit algorithmic descriptions\n  - Add formal complexity analysis and convergence properties of the BSS computation\n  - Include theoretical analysis of BSS behavior under different embedding space properties\n\n• **Enhance experimental validation and consistency**\n  - Conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the k parameter across multiple values and datasets to justify the choice of k=5\n  - Expand survival prediction experiments to all 32 cancer types for consistent comparison with retrieval tasks\n  - Include comparison with existing semantic similarity metrics and human expert evaluations as validation benchmarks\n  - Separate analysis of supervised vs unsupervised pooling effects on BSS to isolate methodological confounds\n\n• **Validate core methodological assumptions**\n  - Provide empirical evidence that LLM representations truly capture medical semantics beyond simple keyword matching\n  - Compare BSS with direct human expert assessments of LVM semantic quality on a subset of cases\n  - Investigate the relationship between embedding space geometry and semantic meaning across different model architectures\n  - Include analysis of failure cases where BSS may not reflect true semantic alignment\n\n• **Improve reproducibility and broader applicability**\n  - Provide complete algorithmic specifications and open-source implementation for all BSS computation steps\n  - Address the consensus variability issue by investigating sources of disagreement between different LLMs\n  - Test BSS stability across different medical domains and imaging modalities beyond pathology\n  - Develop guidelines for selecting appropriate reference LLMs and handling cases where LLM consensus is low",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) shows great potential in assisting radiologists to improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image interpretation and diagnosis. However, a versatile AI model requires large-scale data and comprehensive annotations, which are often impractical in medical settings. Recent studies leverage radiology reports as a naturally high-quality supervision for medical images, using contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) to develop language-informed models for radiological image interpretation. Nonetheless, these approaches typically contrast entire images with reports, neglecting the local associations between imaging regions and report sentences, which may undermine model performance and interoperability. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for anatomy-level CT image interpretation. Specifically, we explicitly match anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports and perform contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. Fine-grained alignment, however, faces considerable false-negative challenges, mainly from the abundance of anatomy-level healthy samples and similarly diseased abnormalities, leading to ambiguous patient-level pairings. To tackle this issue, we propose identifying false negatives of both normal and abnormal samples and calibrating contrastive learning from patient-level to disease-aware pairing. We curated the largest CT dataset to date, comprising imaging and report data from 69,086 patients, and conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 54 major and important disease (including several most deadly cancers) diagnosis tasks across 15 main anatomies. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial potential of fVLM in versatile medical image interpretation. In the zero-shot classification task, we achieved an average AUC of 81.3% on 54 diagnosis tasks, surpassing CLIP and supervised methods by 12.9% and 8.0%, respectively. Additionally, on the publicly available CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT benchmarks, our fVLM outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods with absolute AUC gains of 7.4% and 4.8%, respectively.",

Can the authors improve?\n* Comparison with 2D CLIP Methods: The comparisons made with 2D CLIP methods in Table 1 are not fully explained. Specifically, it's unclear how they adapted these methods to a 3D context and how the training was conducted. Please clarify.\n* Evaluation with CT-CLIP: In Table 3, the comparison with CT-CLIP models is ambiguous. Did the authors fine-tune a pre-trained model (based on their in-house data) on CT-RATE, or was there a different approach taken?\n* t-SNE Consistency: To enhance the consistency of the embedding spaces shown in Fig. 7, the authors could consider setting a random seed before calculating the t-SNE embeddings.\n* HU Value Clipping: The authors chose to clip HU values between -300 and 400, which raises a question: Does this range cover all abnormalities? For instance, lung-related abnormalities are typically closer to -1000 (representing air), while bone-related abnormalities can reach values close to 1000. Since they utilized both non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT scans (arterial, venous, and delayed phases), did they apply this same HU preprocessing across all scans? Additionally, did the authors use this range for the CT-RATE training ablations (which is different than the original CT-RATE paper)?

To improve the granularity of alignment the authors propose to pre-segment key anatomical structures in CT using a public segmentation model (Totalsegmenter), and to pre-segment descriptions corresponding to individual anatomical structures in the free-text report using an open-access LLM (Qwen). This allows fine-grained contrastive learning at the anatomical structure level. Considerations are made to avoid pushing representations of the same organ/condition away. Improved performances are shown for zero-shot abnormality detection compared with several existing approaches.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe idea of increasing the granularity of contrastive learning by data pre-segmentation using public tools is neat, simple, and straightforward. \n\nThe paper is written with sufficient clarity, where the insights behind each design and the implementations details are well-presented. \n\nImproved performance on zero-shot abnormality detection is shown compared with some existing works.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nFor a comprehensive assessment of report generation some essential scores are missing, such as BLEU 1-3, ROUGE-L, and METEOR. Also, comparisons with vision encoders from peer vision-language pre-training for CT works may be needed. This is my major concern as the authors have claimed improved performance on report generation task.\n\nDespite improved granularity, attributing sentences of reports `mentioning` a structure to the image feature of that structure may sometimes be misleading especially when manual verification/correction is not accessible. E.g., in practice pancreatitis is often associated with the entire abdomen instead of the pancreas alone and neighboring structures. The authors are encouraged to comment on this.\n\n### Questions\n\nA high-level question: The capability of open-source image segmentation tools (totalsegmenter and/or SAM family) and open-source LLM advance fiercely -- does it imply that the utility of (un-/weakly-supervised) vision-language pretraining for CT will gradually phase out? One may directly construct semantic labels from text reports using strong enough LLM tools and turn the problem back to large scale supervised learning. I am curious to hear the authors’ insight.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nA separate ICLR ethics reviewer might not be needed.

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI** –  \nThe paper primarily contributes a *methodological innovation* in medical imaging AI: a new **fine‑grained vision–language pre‑training strategy (fVLM)** for CT image understanding. It tackles anatomical‑level image–report alignment and advances multimodal learning beyond global CLIP‑style pairing. This fits well within *TMI*’s scope on imaging methodology (image reconstruction, representation learning, quantitative analysis, and AI interpretability).\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level** –  \nThe work extends foundations of medical vision–language modeling with (i) explicit anatomy‑level alignment rather than implicit attention, and (ii) a dual false‑negative reduction and co‑teaching scheme. Given the novelty of anatomical parsing and disease‑aware contrastive objectives for 3‑D CT data, the paper exceeds incremental improvement. However, its conceptual originality lies mainly in adapting and integrating known components (segmentation‑based locality, CLIP‑style loss, co‑teaching) rather than entirely new theory. It demonstrates strong empirical advancement.\n\n3. **Technical & Experimental Rigor** –  \nThe study uses a very large in‑house dataset (69 k patients, 272 k CTs) with report parsing via LLMs and external validation on CT‑RATE and Rad‑ChestCT. Ablation, scaling, and visualization analyses are sound. Details of preprocessing, annotation, and statistical significance testing are only partly shown in appendices; clarity on IRB approval and specific error analysis could be improved.  \n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation** –  \nThe manuscript is clearly written, with logical structure, extensive comparisons, and readable figures/tables. Minor language polishing would help (grammar, figure referencing, shorthand consistency).  \n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance** –  \nDataset creation claims anonymization but does not explicitly mention institutional ethics approval or data‑sharing policy for MedVL‑CT69K. Code availability is stated via GitHub. The use of LLMs (Qwen 2.5) for report parsing should confirm that no protected health information was exposed externally.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \nThis paper introduces **fVLM**, a fine‑grained vision–language pre‑training framework for 3‑D CT image interpretation. It segments CT volumes into 36 grouped anatomies, decomposes clinical reports into corresponding anatomical sentences using LLM‑driven parsing, and performs per‑anatomy contrastive learning. To mitigate false negatives in contrastive objectives, the authors design a *dual false‑negative correction* that accounts for normal–normal and disease‑consistent samples, implemented via a co‑teaching scheme between two models. Evaluations on a newly built large‑scale dataset (MedVL‑CT69K) and public benchmarks show improved zero‑shot and report‑generation performance over CLIP and prior medical VLMs.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n- Ambitious and timely topic: large‑scale, multimodal CT foundation modeling.  \n- Methodologically more granular than existing VLMs, improving interpretability.  \n- Comprehensive experiments, including ablations, scaling analyses, and multi‑dataset validation.  \n- Demonstrates credible quantitative gains (≈ 8–13 AUC points) and qualitative improvements in attention localization.  \n- Public code release enhances reproducibility.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n- Novelty is somewhat incremental (integration of established ideas) rather than theoretical breakthrough.  \n- Heavy reliance on an internal dataset; lack of detailed description of patient cohort, scanner diversity, and ethical oversight.  \n- The dual false‑negative and co‑teaching strategy needs stronger mathematical or empirical justification (hyperparameter sensitivity, convergence).  \n- Report decomposition via LLMs may introduce unquantified errors; no inter‑annotator or parsing accuracy analysis reported.  \n- Limited discussion of computational cost and inference efficiency for clinical deployment.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n1. **Dataset Ethics and Generalizability:** Provide explicit approval or de‑identification description for MedVL‑CT69K and clarify whether the data can be publicly released or partially shared.  \n2. **Quantitative Robustness:** Add confidence intervals or statistical tests for improvements (AUC gains) across tasks and anatomies.  \n3. **LLM‑Based Report Parsing:** Quantify parsing accuracy against a radiologist‑verified subset; discuss robustness to differing report templates.  \n4. **False‑Negative Reduction:** Offer an intuition or analytic analysis of how the label‑correction weighting (α = 0.5) affects training stability; consider providing ablation over α.  \n5. **Computational Efficiency:** Report GPU hours and inference speed, comparing to CT‑CLIP or Merlin, as this informs clinical scalability.  \n6. **Visualization/Interpretability:** Include qualitative examples illustrating where fVLM improves localization relative to CLIP in 3‑D context.\n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n- Check typographical inconsistencies (e.g., “ﬁndings/impression,” “Spec/Sens”).  \n- Ensure figure legends are self‑contained.  \n- Reference numbering for certain works (e.g., duplicate Lin 2023) should be verified.  \n- Clarify abbreviations in tables (GREEN, CoT).  \n- Provide full specification of training hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate).  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation** – **Major Revision**\n\n*Justification:* The study demonstrates clear methodological and experimental promise highly relevant to *TMI*, but key clarifications on ethical compliance, dataset transparency, and deeper analysis of the proposed modules are necessary before publication.\n\n7. **Confidence Level** – **4 / 5** (High confidence in technical assessment; limited access to supplementary ethics details)\n\n---\n\n**Guidance to the Authors:**  \nTo elevate the paper to *TMI* standards, emphasize methodological insight—formalize the false‑negative correction, validate report parsing quantitatively, and provide transparency on dataset governance.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper proposes fVLM, a fine-grained vision-language model for CT image understanding that addresses misalignment issues in existing CLIP-based approaches. The method performs anatomy-level alignment between CT scan regions and corresponding radiology report descriptions, rather than global image-report contrastive learning. The approach uses TotalSegmentator to parse anatomical structures (Section 3.1, Page 4) and employs LLMs to decompose reports into anatomy-specific descriptions (Figure 2, Page 4). To handle false negatives arising from abundant normal samples and similar pathologies, the authors introduce a dual false negative reduction strategy with co-teaching (Section 3.3, Pages 6-7). The method is evaluated on MedVL-CT69K, a curated dataset of 272,124 CT scans from 69,086 patients. Results show fVLM achieves 81.3% average AUC across 54 disease diagnosis tasks, outperforming CLIP by 12.9% and supervised methods by 8.0% (Table 1, Page 8). Additional evaluations on CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT benchmarks demonstrate 7.4% and 4.8% absolute AUC improvements respectively (Table 2, Page 9).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - The similarity calculation in Equation 1 (Page 6) uses inconsistent notation where Nj represents \"number of structurally complete samples\" but the summation indices suggest batch-level operations, creating confusion about the actual computation scope\n  - The loss function in Equation 2 lacks clear definition of what constitutes \"structurally complete samples\" and how this affects gradient computation across anatomies with different sample counts\n  - The co-teaching formulation in Equation 3 (Page 7) sets α=0.5 empirically without theoretical justification or sensitivity analysis, undermining the mathematical rigor of the approach\n\n• **Insufficient experimental validation and evaluation gaps**\n  - The dataset split details show only 1,151 validation patients versus 64,476 training patients (Page 8), representing an unusually small validation set that may not provide reliable model selection and hyperparameter tuning\n  - The comparison with radiologists is relegated to \"Appendix A.3\" (Page 9) without presenting quantitative results in the main paper, limiting assessment of clinical relevance\n  - Missing ablation studies on key architectural choices such as the grouping of 104 anatomical regions into 36 categories (Section 3.1, Page 4), which directly impacts the core fine-grained alignment capability\n\n• **Technical approach limitations and methodological concerns**\n  - The reliance on TotalSegmentator for anatomy parsing (Figure 2, Page 4) introduces potential error propagation from segmentation failures, but no analysis is provided on how segmentation quality affects downstream performance\n  - The report decomposition using LLMs with string-matching fallback (Section 3.1, Page 5) lacks quantitative evaluation of decomposition accuracy, which is critical since misaligned text-image pairs would undermine the entire training objective\n  - The false negative identification strategy assumes anatomies not mentioned in impression sections are normal (Page 7), but this heuristic may not hold across different reporting styles or institutions, potentially introducing systematic biases\n\n• **Experimental design and reproducibility concerns**\n  - The co-teaching strategy employs \"different model initialization, data iteration sequences and augmentations\" (Page 8) for model diversity, but these implementation details are not specified, hindering reproducibility\n  - The MedVL-CT69K dataset curation process lacks details about data quality control, institutional diversity, or potential selection biases that could affect generalizability\n  - The zero-shot evaluation setup does not clearly specify how disease categories were defined or annotated, particularly for the 54 diseases across 15 anatomies mentioned in the abstract but not fully detailed until appendix references\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation clarity**\n  - Clearly define Nj in Equation 1 and specify whether it represents per-anatomy sample counts or batch-level indices, and provide explicit algorithmic descriptions for handling variable anatomy presence across samples\n  - Add theoretical analysis or empirical sensitivity study for the α=0.5 choice in Equation 3, demonstrating robustness to this hyperparameter selection\n  - Include formal definitions of \"structurally complete samples\" and provide computational complexity analysis for the anatomy-specific contrastive learning framework\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation with comprehensive baselines**\n  - Increase validation set size or provide justification for the current split, and include cross-validation results to demonstrate model stability across different data partitions\n  - Present quantitative radiologist comparison results in the main paper with statistical significance testing and inter-rater agreement analysis\n  - Add comprehensive ablation studies on anatomical grouping strategies, comparing performance across different granularity levels from 104 regions to various grouping schemes\n\n• **Address technical limitations with robust evaluation**\n  - Quantitatively evaluate TotalSegmentator segmentation quality on the dataset and analyze correlation between segmentation accuracy and final model performance\n  - Develop and report metrics for report decomposition quality, potentially using expert annotations on a subset to validate LLM-based anatomy extraction accuracy\n  - Test the impression-section heuristic across different institutions or report templates, and provide alternative strategies for normal case identification\n\n• **Improve experimental design and ensure reproducibility**\n  - Provide complete implementation details for the co-teaching diversity strategies, including specific augmentation types, initialization schemes, and iteration order variations\n  - Include detailed dataset curation methodology with quality control measures, institutional sources, and potential bias analysis\n  - Clearly specify disease annotation protocols and provide inter-annotator agreement statistics for the 54 disease categories, with detailed breakdown by anatomy type",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\n### This manuscript introduces a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) designed for enhanced CT image understanding, specifically focusing on anatomy-level interpretation and diagnosis. The proposed method explicitly aligns anatomical regions of CT images with corresponding descriptions in radiology reports, performing contrastive pre-training for each anatomy individually. To address the challenge of false negatives, the authors propose a dual false negative reduction (FNR) approach. The model is evaluated on a large-scale in-house dataset (MedVL-CT69K) and two public benchmarks (CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT), demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods in zero-shot classification tasks. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for bridging fine-grained vision-language alignment is clearly articulated.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning:\n   The introduction of anatomy-level fine-grained alignment is innovative, but the manuscript needs to better position its contribution relative to existing literature. The authors should provide a more thorough discussion on how their method compares to recent advancements in fine-grained alignment techniques and contrastive learning for medical imaging. This will help clarify the novelty and the specific advancements over previous works.\n\n2. Evaluation Design:\n   The evaluation is primarily conducted on the in-house MedVL-CT69K dataset, which is extensive but proprietary. While the authors demonstrate impressive results, the reliance on a single proprietary dataset limits the generalizability of the findings. Including a broader range of datasets, especially ones with varying patient demographics and imaging protocols, would strengthen the validation of the proposed method.\n\n3. Comparisons:\n   The manuscript provides a comprehensive comparison with several existing methods, but it lacks a detailed discussion on how the proposed method compares to recent advancements in multi-modal pre-training for medical imaging. The authors should include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art models that incorporate domain-specific knowledge or use advanced architectures tailored for medical imaging.\n\n4. Reproducibility:\n   While the authors mention that code will be made available, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters used. Providing a more detailed methodology section, including pseudocode or a flowchart of the training pipeline, would significantly enhance the reproducibility of the work.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 3 and 4 are somewhat cluttered and could benefit from simplification and clearer labeling to improve readability.\n2. Notation: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is inconsistent and could be clarified for better understanding.\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"CT-CLIP\") are used without definition, which can confuse readers.\n4. Typographical Issues: There are minor typographical errors throughout the manuscript (e.g., \"k-spacce\", \"undersampling maskes\").\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical image interpretation by proposing a fine-grained vision-language model (fVLM) for CT image understanding. The method's technical innovation lies in its explicit alignment of anatomical regions with corresponding report descriptions, which is a promising direction in the field. However, the evaluation primarily relies on a single proprietary dataset, which limits the generalizability of the findings. The manuscript's reproducibility is compromised by incomplete descriptions of the training protocols and preprocessing steps. While the proposed method shows substantial potential, the current evidence falls short of fully meeting the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include recent state-of-the-art methods, broaden the evaluation to include additional datasets, and provide more detailed methodological descriptions to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Zero-shot medical detection can further improve detection performance without relying on annotated medical images even upon the fine-tuned model, showing great clinical value. Recent studies leverage grounded vision-language models (GLIP) to achieve this by using detailed disease descriptions as prompts for the target disease name during the inference phase.  \nHowever, these methods typically treat prompts as equivalent context to the target name, making it difficult to assign specific disease knowledge based on visual information, leading to a coarse alignment between images and target descriptions. In this paper, we propose StructuralGLIP, which introduces an auxiliary branch to encode prompts into a latent knowledge bank layer-by-layer, enabling more context-aware and fine-grained alignment. Specifically, in each layer, we select highly similar features from both the image representation and the knowledge bank, forming structural representations that capture nuanced relationships between image patches and target descriptions. These features are then fused across modalities to further enhance detection performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that StructuralGLIP achieves a +4.1\\% AP improvement over prior state-of-the-art methods across seven zero-shot medical detection benchmarks, and consistently improves fine-tuned models by +3.2\\% AP on endoscopy image datasets.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a zero-shot object detection model, StructrualGLIP, for medical image-based object detection tasks. The method uses a knowledge bank that stores encoded text prompts, which are later used to select and match relevant image features to form fine-grained structural representations to allow better alignment of image features with the prompt information, achieving accurate, context-aware detection.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. the paper demonstrates a comprehensive evaluation of four medical image modalities.\n2. the paper's representation and structure are mostly clear and easy to follow (although with some language and word choice issues, which will be discussed below).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The claimed novelty appears to be on the latent knowledge bank and its function to store encoded prompt tokens and later be used at each encoder layer as a vision token selector and vice versa. This is coined as a mutual selection process. The selected information is then merged into the original image and text encoder back at each layer. The entire process is different to a standard contextual prompt method (Fig. 1(a)) but it feels like a quite incremental difference which I don't see much novelty.\n2. The word choice of \"medical detection\" bugs me, in medical science detection refers to \"detecting diseases\" whereas here this is object detection in medical images so this may cause confusion to certain readers.\n3. Line 234 looks unfinished.\n4. Eq. 6&7, perhaps the Top-P/Q^{max} function can be simplified by using argmax/argsort function?\n5. L201/534: \"... fine-grained alignment between target descriptions and medical images\", L:256 \"forming fine-grained structural representations\", can the authors clarify what \"fine-grained\" refers to in those places?\n6. L294: \"...like BLIP Li et al. (2022a)\", is the VQA model BLIP or not? Have you considered other VQA models and would the performance of other VQA models fluctuate your detection results?\n7. L177: I don't entirely agree that zero-shot detection has a real-world clinical need as the clinicians I've encountered would not trust zero-shot settings, in the medical domain, accurate detection/segmentation/diagnosis is the the most important thing.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease address Weaknesses #1,5,6.\n\n\n------------------\n04/12/2024:\nI thank the authors' detailed responses. Since the reviewer's post deadline has passed so I am writing my final comments here. \n\nMy conclusion is that I will retain my original score. I believe the paper should improve clarity as many new arguments and technical details surfaced during the discussion period which should have been included in the main manuscript. The novelty and settings should be explored in more depth.\n\nMy comments are:\n\n1. Novelty. \n\nI agree with the authors' argument the image and language encoders do not need to be fine-tuned in your zero-shot detection setting. This I already mentioned in my last comment: \"I can understand if the auxiliary branch's language encoder is untrained\". My question was whether the modules in Eq. 8 to 10 need training or not? Especially the MHA module in Eq. 8, GLIP has the X-MHA module, did the author reuse the X-MHA weights for the MHA without retraining? The authors mentioned in L263 \"we employ a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism\" which reads like it is a new module by the authors' own design. Given an MHA module (as far as I know) should have learnable weights but the authors claim the zero-shot detection setting is training-free, then I find the logic here is contradicted. Furthermore, the authors quoted L210 to demonstrate the training-free paradigm, but that is immediately after Eq.4 and the sentence only describes the encoders. This is an imprecise response to my question so I'm not making a judgment here, but this does make me think the paper should improve clarity. \n\nThe above was not the main point of my original novelty concern, but a spin-off. My original point was that if the authors wanted to demonstrate the \"preventing/addressing domain shifting\" argument for the novelty, you should consider measuring the actual feature distribution difference between GLIP and StructureGLIP.  The authors revealed in the last comments that the domain referred to the features before RPN, and that is what I think you should demonstrate. To recap the authors' comments, the authors claimed the other methods would concatenate prompt so the feature to RPN becomes CLS token of [target_name, prompt] which causes the domain shift, whereas StructualGLIP did the prompts integration in early layers so StructuralGLIP only has CLS of [target_name] to the RPN, and that addresses the domain shift. Conceptually, maybe it is true but please provide empirical evidence. The final performance is a surrogate measure, which does not directly support your domain shift argument. Finally, StructrualGLIP also fuses additional information in the process, so the CLS token should exhibit some domain shift as you are trying to do domain adaptation, these two arguments also have contradictions to each other. \n\nRegarding the \"addressing noise prompt\" argument, I'd imagine the top-P/Q has a certain capability of limiting noise prompts as you only choose the top tokens, so even when you add more prompts, they won't be selected if the network was already trained to have higher attention for the target classes tokens, but that on the other hand, make it trivial argument rather than a novelty.\n\n7. Zero-shot enhancement. After reading the authors' most recent comments, I strongly feel the setting should not be called zero-shot. When the target dataset's labelled data are already used to fine-tune your GLIP base model, then this is weakly supervised. In L175-176, the authors state \"We propose a zero-shot enhancement setting. This involves fine-tuning the model on medical datasets first, and then using prompts to further improve performance on unseen medical images\", initially I considered this as the model was trained on relevant datasets such as same/similar imaging modalities but different tasks or different datasets. However, if the target dataset itself was used for finetuning for training, then the \"further improve performance on unseen medical images\" does not hold.\n\nOther comments:\nThe experiments I requested were for the understanding of how much performance gain was attributable to the design/novelty of StructrualGLIP, i.e., the introduction of the auxiliary branch. The zero-shot enhancement setting (i.e., fine-tuned GLIP) has boosted the performance by a larger margin than the StructualGLIP can bring to GLIP. Also, the choice of the VQA can sometimes affect the AP/AP50 by a noticeable margin (i.e., that 75 AP) but it appears not stable. Then, at least for me, the viability of zero-shot medical detection unfortunately remains questionable.\n\nOnce again I appreciate the authors' effort to address my comments but I'm sorry I will retain my original score based on my thoughts above. The authors are encouraged to delve into the details of the novelty and concepts as well as improve clarity of the manuscript.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

Overall, the clarity and quality of the presentation are mixed, with clear structural organization but notable language issues.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. **Novelty**: The method's novelty relies on the use of a latent knowledge bank for prompt token selection. However, this incremental difference lacks substantial innovation over standard contextual prompt methods, which diminishes its perceived uniqueness.\n2. **Terminology Clarity**: The term \"medical detection\" is misleading as it may imply detecting diseases rather than objects in medical images, potentially causing confusion among readers.\n3. **Technical Clarity**: Line 234 appears incomplete, requiring revision for coherence.\n4. **Equation Simplification**: Equations 6 and 7 might benefit from simplification by utilizing argmax/argsort functions.\n5. **Clarification Needed**: The use of \"fine-grained\" in lines 201/534 and 256 needs clarification regarding what it specifically refers to in context.\n6. **VQA Model Context**: The mention of BLIP as a VQA model raises questions regarding its inclusion.

The evaluation design is complex but lacks empirical evidence supporting claims of addressing domain shift. Reproducibility is questionable due to potential misunderstandings around zero-shot settings, and the clarity of the manuscript needs improvement to effectively communicate its contributions.\n\n### Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision is necessary to address clarity issues, refine the novelty claims, and provide more comprehensive evaluations and empirical support related to the methods proposed.",

The approach introduces a “knowledge bank” storing encoded text prompts that interact with image features to generate fine-grained structural representations for improved image–prompt alignment. The manuscript is generally clear and well organized, with comprehensive experiments across four medical imaging modalities. Nevertheless, several aspects of novelty, clarity, and the definition of the claimed “zero-shot” setting require further refinement.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Novelty and Contribution** – The proposed latent knowledge bank and mutual selection mechanism appear conceptually similar to existing contextual prompt methods, rendering the contribution incremental rather than fundamentally novel. The claimed innovations (e.g., domain-shift mitigation and noise-prompt suppression) are not convincingly supported by empirical evidence. The reviewer encourages quantitative analysis of feature distribution differences between GLIP and StructuralGLIP to substantiate the domain shift claim.  \n2. **Training-Free Logic** – Clarification is needed regarding whether modules in Eqs. 8–10, particularly the Multi-Head Attention (MHA), possess learnable parameters or reuse pretrained weights. This point appears inconsistent with the claim of a training-free zero-shot paradigm.  \n3. **Definition of Zero-Shot Enhancement** – The so-called “zero-shot enhancement” involves fine-tuning on the target dataset, which contradicts the zero-shot premise and aligns more closely with a weakly supervised setting. This requires clearer articulation.  \n4. **Evaluation and Comparisons** – The experiments show performance gains, yet the magnitude of improvement due to the new architecture versus fine-tuning remains unclear. Variability introduced by the choice of VQA model also affects stability, questioning reliability.  \n5. **Conceptual Clarity** – Several statements use vague terminology, such as “fine-grained alignment.” The meaning of such terms should be explicitly defined. Additionally, some lines (e.g., L234) appear incomplete or unclear.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The phrase “medical detection” could be confusing; “object detection in medical images” would be clearer.  \n- Typographical and stylistic issues appear in line references and equations (e.g., simplification of Top‑P/Q^{max} using argmax/argsort).  \n- Figures and equation references—especially Fig. 1(a)—should be checked for consistency.  \n- Clarify whether the model compared to BLIP refers specifically to the VQA model version used.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph (TMI Criteria)**  \nIn terms of **significance**, the problem of medical zero-shot detection is relevant, but the proposed novelty remains modest. Regarding **innovation**, the introduction of a knowledge bank and mutual selection process is potentially interesting yet not convincingly distinct from prior methods. The **evaluation** is broad across modalities but leaves unresolved questions about the attribution of performance gains and stability of comparisons. For **reproducibility**, the paper is mostly transparent yet requires clearer explanation of training-free claims and fine-tuning protocols to ensure the results can be independently verified.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**  \nSubstantial clarifications on novelty, experimental evidence, and consistency of the zero-shot definition are needed before publication.",

This work is aiming for a vital issue in medical image understanding field, which is the generalization capability of foundation models with limit data access.

One of the major problem of the proposed method is not trainable as the Top-K selection operation is non-differentiable, while previous work is differentiable and thus finetuning would result in better performance.

The manuscript fits well within the IEEE TMI scope (image reconstruction, learning‑based detection, quantitative analysis).\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe idea of embedding prompts into a hierarchical latent memory and dynamically selecting sub‑tokens for cross‑modal fusion goes beyond prior GLIP or prompt‑pool methods.

A mutual‑selection mechanism retrieves the most relevant prompt and image tokens at each layer to form structural representations that enhance cross‑modal alignment.  The method supports both instance‑ and category‑level prompts and extends to a “zero‑shot enhancement” mode that boosts performance of fine‑tuned detectors without extra labels.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThe paper proposes StructuralGLIP, a zero-shot medical detection framework that addresses coarse image-description alignment in existing grounded vision-language models. The method introduces a dual-branch architecture where prompts are encoded into a latent knowledge bank via an auxiliary branch, while the main branch processes target names and images. A mutual selection mechanism dynamically retrieves relevant visual and linguistic tokens at each layer to form structural representations. The approach supports both instance-level and category-level prompts, with category-level prompts remaining fixed across instances of the same class. Experiments across eight medical datasets (endoscopy, microscopy, photography, radiology) demonstrate superior performance in both zero-shot detection and zero-shot enhancement settings, achieving average improvements of +4.2% AP in zero-shot detection and enabling fine-tuned models to surpass fully supervised baselines.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n**• Mathematical Formulation Clarity and Consistency Issues**\n  - The mutual selection mechanism equations (6-7) use unclear notation where similarity calculations are embedded within Top-P/Top-Q operations without explicit definition of the similarity function (Section 3.2, Page 5). This obscures the computational process and reproducibility.\n  - The residual connections in Equation (9) lack mathematical justification for why additive combination is optimal compared to other fusion strategies, affecting theoretical soundness.\n  - Inconsistent notation usage where Ki_v and Ki_l represent both selected tokens and their associated values throughout Section 3.2, creating potential confusion in understanding the selection process.\n\n**• Insufficient Experimental Validation and Baseline Comparisons**\n  - Limited comparison with recent vision-language medical detection methods beyond GLIP-based approaches, with no comparison to domain-specific medical detection frameworks (Tables 1, 4). This restricts assessment of the method's competitive positioning.\n  - Ablation studies focus primarily on hyperparameters P and Q (Table 5) but lack comprehensive analysis of architectural choices such as the dual-branch design versus alternative fusion strategies, limiting understanding of design necessity.\n  - The zero-shot enhancement setting evaluation lacks comparison with other prompt-based enhancement methods on fine-tuned models, making it difficult to assess the uniqueness of the approach (Section 4.3).\n\n**• Methodological Limitations and Technical Concerns**\n  - The category-level prompt generation relies heavily on GPT-4 quality without systematic evaluation of prompt robustness across different medical domains (Section 3.3, Figure 3b). This creates potential generalization concerns for rare diseases or specialized imaging modalities.\n  - The mutual selection mechanism's computational overhead during inference is not quantified, particularly concerning the Top-P and Top-Q operations across multiple layers (Equations 6-7), which could impact clinical deployment feasibility.\n  - Limited analysis of failure cases or method limitations, with most qualitative results showing successful detections (Figures A, B, E) rather than systematic error analysis, reducing understanding of method boundaries.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n**• Enhance Mathematical Rigor and Notation Consistency**\n  - Explicitly define the similarity function used in Equations (6-7) with mathematical formulation (e.g., cosine similarity, dot product) and provide theoretical justification for the choice. Include algorithmic pseudocode for the Top-P/Top-Q selection process to improve reproducibility.\n  - Provide theoretical analysis or empirical validation for the additive residual connection design in Equation (9), comparing against alternative fusion strategies (concatenation, learned weighting) to justify the architectural choice.\n  - Establish consistent notation throughout Section 3.2, clearly distinguishing between token indices, selected tokens, and their representations, potentially using subscripts or different symbols to avoid confusion.\n\n**• Expand Experimental Evaluation and Analysis**\n  - Include comparisons with recent domain-specific medical detection methods and non-GLIP-based vision-language approaches to establish comprehensive competitive analysis. Add comparison with other prompt-based enhancement methods on fine-tuned models.\n  - Conduct systematic ablation studies on architectural components including dual-branch versus single-branch designs, alternative fusion mechanisms, and different knowledge bank organizations to validate design necessity.\n  - Provide detailed failure case analysis, computational cost analysis including inference time and memory overhead, and systematic evaluation of prompt robustness across different medical imaging modalities and rare diseases.\n\n**• Address Methodological Limitations and Practical Concerns**\n  - Develop systematic evaluation framework for prompt quality across different medical domains, including analysis of GPT-4 limitations for rare diseases and alternative prompt generation strategies for specialized medical contexts.\n  - Quantify computational overhead of the mutual selection mechanism and provide efficiency analysis comparing inference costs with baseline methods, including optimization strategies for clinical deployment.\n  - Include comprehensive error analysis with failure case studies, method limitation discussion, and systematic evaluation of robustness to noisy or incomplete prompts, providing clearer understanding of method applicability boundaries.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\n### This manuscript introduces StructuralGLIP, a novel framework for zero-shot medical detection that utilizes a dual-branch architecture to integrate category-level prompts into a latent knowledge bank. The authors argue that this approach enhances the alignment between image features and target descriptions, leading to improved detection performance. The proposed method is evaluated on eight datasets spanning various imaging conditions, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. The manuscript is well-written and presents a compelling argument for the benefits of using category-level prompts in medical detection tasks.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While StructuralGLIP introduces a promising approach for zero-shot medical detection, the manuscript does not sufficiently distinguish itself from existing works that also leverage vision-language models for medical detection. The authors should provide a clearer comparative analysis to highlight the unique contributions of StructuralGLIP over similar methods.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experiments are conducted on a diverse set of datasets, which is commendable. However, the evaluation is predominantly focused on zero-shot detection settings without extensive validation in zero-shot enhancement scenarios. Including more comprehensive evaluations under different conditions, such as prospective and multi-anatomy validation, would strengthen the claims of the method's generalizability.\n\n3. Comparisons: The baseline comparisons are thorough, but the manuscript could benefit from including more recent diffusion-based and transformer-based methods in the comparison to establish a clearer baseline for evaluating StructuralGLIP’s performance.\n\n4. Reproducibility: Although the authors state that the code will be made available, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters. Providing these details is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of the results.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Some figures are cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions to enhance readability.\n   \n2. Notation and Terminology: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is inconsistent and lacks sufficient explanation. Clarifying these points would aid in understanding the methodology.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition, which can be confusing for readers. Defining these acronyms would improve clarity.\n\n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" and \"undersampling maskes\" should be corrected.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(Focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\n\nSignificance: StructuralGLIP addresses a significant challenge in medical imaging by improving zero-shot detection capabilities without the need for annotated data. The manuscript demonstrates the potential for enhanced detection performance across various medical imaging modalities, which is clinically relevant.\n\nInnovation: The dual-branch architecture and the integration of category-level prompts into a latent knowledge bank represent innovative contributions to the field. These enhancements offer a promising direction for improving zero-shot detection in medical imaging.\n\nEvaluation: The evaluation is comprehensive but could be strengthened with additional comparisons to recent diffusion-based and transformer-based methods. Furthermore, broader validation across different imaging conditions would provide a more robust assessment of the method’s performance.\n\nReproducibility: The manuscript lacks detailed methodological descriptions necessary for reproducibility. Providing complete training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameter settings would greatly enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\nOverall, while StructuralGLIP offers significant potential, the current manuscript requires additional work to fully meet the standards of rigor and reproducibility expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand comparative analysis, strengthen validation across datasets and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

It fulfills the needs in real-world diagnosis protocol to leverage information from different data sources and simultaneously perform mutually informative tasks. However, medical imaging domains introduce two key challenges: dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence. The quality and amount of task-related information from different modalities could vary significantly across patient samples, due to biological and demographic factors. Traditional fusion methods apply fixed combination strategies that fail to capture this dynamic relationship, potentially underutilizing modalities that carry stronger diagnostic signals for specific patients. Additionally, different clinical tasks may require dynamic feature selection and combination from various modalities, a phenomenon we term “modality-task dependence.” To address these issues, we propose M4oE, a novel Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts framework for precise Medical diagnosis. M4oE comprises Modality-Specific (MSoE) modules and a Modality-shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module. With collaboration from both modules, our model dynamically decomposes and learns distinct and shared information from different modalities and achieves dynamic fusion. MToE provides a joint probability model of modalities and tasks by using experts as a link and encourages experts to learn modality-task dependence via conditional mutual information loss. By doing so, M4oE offers sample and population-level interpretability of modality contributions. We evaluate M4oE on four public multi-modal medical benchmark datasets for solving two important medical diagnostic problems including breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis. Results demonstrate our method's superiority over state-of-the-art methods under different metrics of classification and segmentation tasks like Accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC, and DICE.",

Concretely, this is done by using a combination of modality-specific experts and experts shared between modalities and tasks. M4OE shows promising initial results in terms of both absolute performance and enforcing modality utilization.\n\nBased on the weaknesses and questions outlined my score indicates a rejection for now, but I generally like the motivation of the paper, especially the aspect on modality utilization. I am willing to increase my score if my concerns are addressed and questions clarified.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The M4OE is highly effective at enforcing modality utilization - this is a meaningful contribution that many multimodal models suffer from, although I do have some questions about this.\n- The overall performance of the model is outperforming the baseline, even if the results are missing crucial information to validate the statistical significance of the results.\n- Strong visuals that are additive to the understanding of the paper.\n- Good conceptual motivation of the paper, although I believe that the motivation would further benefit from some concrete examples of sample dynamism and clinical examples of tasks that are modality-dependent.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Abstract: the one-liner for sample-dynamic modality fusion is unclear as the specific and shared information always varies per sample unless they are identical. To my knowledge, sample-dynamic spans a much wider field of problems like missingness, robustness to noise, which the manuscript does not consider.\n- Abstract: “Results demonstrate superiority over state-of-the-art methods” is extremely vague. Along which metric?\n- You claim an expansive space by saying that the method is “multi-modal multi-task”, but your experiments only look at multi-view settings of a single modality (images). I would encourage you to narrow the scope/claim of the paper as the paper does not consider heterogeneous modalities (images, text, tabular, etc.).\n- Experimental setup: I would encourage you to provide more detail in this section to aid reproducibility. For example, it is unclear whether cross-validation is used. No confidence intervals or standard deviation of results are reported to judge the statistical significance of the results. Additionally, no code was provided in the supplementary materials that would help with the clarification of the experimental setup.\n- Literature: missing out on the largest corpus of literature (intermediate fusion), which many latent variable models for multimodal fusion fall under, many of which are using a mix of modality-specific and shared spaces.\n\n### Questions\n\n- How do you determine which expert sees which task? The connection between Figure 1 and the method section is not very clear.\n- The manuscript talks a lot about sample adaptivity, but how does your experimental setup show that the model handles sample adaptivity effectively? Which aspects of sample adaptivity?\n- Figure 3c suggests that the modality utilization is forced towards the same mean in your method. What about cases where modality dominance/competition is good? For example, if I have one very noisy modality, wouldn’t it be desirable to have the modality that contains all the signal to get all the model’s attention? Isn’t this graph showing that we enforce equal utilisation of all modalities regardless of the signal? Additionally, does this finding not contradict your claim in Figure 1, which is that only some experts are used (as opposed to all experts with a more balanced contribution).\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 3",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses multi-modal multi-task learning in medical imaging by proposing M4oE (Multi-modal Multi-task Mixture of Experts). The authors identify two key challenges: dynamic modality fusion where the quality and relevance of different imaging modalities varies across patients, and modality-task dependence where different clinical tasks require dynamic feature selection from various modalities. M4oE consists of Modality-Specific MoE (MSoE) modules and a Modality-shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module that dynamically decomposes modality-specific and shared information. The framework uses conditional mutual information loss to encourage experts to learn modality-task dependencies. Experiments on four public datasets (EMBED, RSNA, VinDr-Mammo, GAMMA) for breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods across classification and segmentation tasks, measured by Accuracy, AUROC, AUPRC, and DICE scores.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - The conditional probability definitions in Section 3.3 lack clear denominators and appear inconsistent (e.g., P(Ej|Tk) formula uses summation over modalities in numerator but tasks and experts in denominator)\n  - The conditional mutual information I(M; E|T) formulation in Section 3.3 is presented without sufficient mathematical rigor regarding how probabilities are estimated from the soft routing weights\n  - The relationship between the routing matrix XΦ and probability distributions needs clearer mathematical justification, particularly how soft weights translate to valid probability measures\n\n• **Limited experimental rigor and evaluation gaps**\n  - Table 1 shows results only for 3 out of 7 tasks on EMBED dataset, with complete results relegated to appendix, limiting assessment of multi-task performance claims\n  - The gradient conflict analysis in Figure 6 uses only a reduced experiment (16 experts, 7 tasks) rather than the full model configuration, weakening the validity of this key claim\n  - Cross-validation methodology is mentioned as 5-fold but detailed experimental setup, statistical significance testing, and error analysis are insufficient across all experiments\n\n• **Insufficient baseline comparisons and ablation studies**\n  - The paper lacks comparison with recent MoE-based medical imaging methods, with some comparisons mentioned as \"included in Appendix\" (Page 7) but not thoroughly analyzed\n  - Ablation studies in Table 2 are limited to only 3 tasks from EMBED dataset, insufficient to validate component effectiveness across diverse medical imaging scenarios\n  - The modality competition analysis in Figure 3(a) compares only against basic fusion methods rather than more sophisticated multi-modal approaches from recent literature\n\n• **Questionable interpretability claims and analysis depth**\n  - The sample-level interpretability claims in Figure 5 lack validation against ground truth or clinical expert assessment, making it unclear whether the interpretations are medically meaningful\n  - The synergy analysis using PID theory in Figure 4 requires external domain knowledge not sufficiently explained, and the clinical relevance of the synergy patterns is not validated\n  - Population-level modality contribution analysis lacks statistical validation and comparison with known clinical understanding of modality importance for different tasks\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Provide rigorous derivations for all conditional probability formulations in Section 3.3, clearly defining how soft routing weights are converted to valid probability distributions\n  - Add formal mathematical proofs or detailed explanations for the conditional mutual information objective, including convergence properties and theoretical justifications\n  - Standardize notation throughout the paper and ensure all probability expressions have consistent and correct mathematical forms with proper normalization\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation and statistical analysis**\n  - Report complete results for all 7 tasks on EMBED dataset in the main paper with proper statistical significance testing and confidence intervals\n  - Conduct gradient conflict analysis using the full model configuration (128 experts) rather than reduced settings to validate this key technical claim\n  - Provide detailed cross-validation procedures, statistical significance tests, and comprehensive error analysis for all experimental results across all datasets\n\n• **Expand baseline comparisons and comprehensive ablation studies**\n  - Include thorough comparison with recent MoE-based medical imaging methods in the main paper rather than relegating to appendix\n  - Conduct ablation studies across all four datasets and all tasks to demonstrate consistent component effectiveness across diverse medical imaging scenarios\n  - Compare against more sophisticated multi-modal fusion approaches from recent literature in the modality competition analysis\n\n• **Validate interpretability claims with clinical ground truth**\n  - Collaborate with clinical experts to validate whether sample-level and population-level interpretability outputs align with known medical understanding\n  - Provide statistical validation of modality contribution patterns against established clinical knowledge and compare with expert radiologist assessments\n  - Include more detailed explanation of PID theory and clinical validation of synergy patterns, demonstrating that the learned modality-task dependencies reflect genuine medical insights",

The proposed model addresses the challenges of dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence by integrating modality-specific and shared information in a sample-adaptive manner. M4oE utilizes a combination of Modality-Specific MoE (MSoE) modules and a Modality-Shared Modality-Task MoE (MToE) module to dynamically learn and fuse information from different modalities and tasks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of M4oE on four benchmark datasets for breast cancer screening and retinal disease diagnosis, showcasing superior performance over existing methods.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The manuscript introduces a sophisticated approach to multi-modal multi-task learning in medical imaging, which is a significant area of interest. However, the novelty of M4oE needs to be more clearly articulated in relation to existing multi-modal and multi-task frameworks. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison with recent advancements in the field, particularly those that also employ MoE architectures for dynamic fusion.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design: The experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets, which is commendable. However, the validation is limited to a few specific tasks (density classification and cancer risk prediction for mammograms, and glaucoma detection and optical cup segmentation for ophthalmology). The authors should consider extending the evaluation to additional tasks and modalities to better demonstrate the generalizability and robustness of M4oE.\n\n3. Comparisons: While the authors compare M4oE with a variety of baselines, including single-task and multi-task models, the comparison lacks some recent state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal multi-task learning. Including more recent works would provide a more comprehensive benchmark and strengthen the claim of M4oE's superiority.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript mentions that the code will be released, but the details on the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameter settings are somewhat sparse. Providing a more detailed description of the experimental setup and making the code publicly available upon acceptance would significantly enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity of Figures: Some figures (e.g., Fig. 3) are cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative examples with zoomed-in regions for better clarity.\n2. Notation Consistency: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is sometimes inconsistent, leading to confusion. The authors should ensure uniformity in the usage of symbols and terms throughout the manuscript.\n3. Acronym Definitions: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without proper definitions, which might be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the specific context. Defining these acronyms would improve readability.\n4. Typographical Errors: There are typographical errors throughout the manuscript (e.g., \"k-spacce\", \"undersampling maskes\"), which need to be corrected.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(Focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\nThe manuscript tackles a significant and clinically relevant problem in medical imaging by proposing M4oE, a framework that addresses dynamic modality fusion and modality-task dependence. The technical innovation of integrating modality-specific and shared information through MoE networks is promising and could lead to meaningful advancements in multi-modal multi-task learning. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by extending it to more diverse datasets and tasks, and the reproducibility could be enhanced by providing more detailed methodological details. Overall, while the manuscript shows promise, it requires additional validation and clarification to fully meet the standards of significance, innovation, evaluation, and reproducibility expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should extend the evaluation to include more diverse datasets and tasks, provide a more comprehensive comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods, and enhance the reproducibility by detailing the experimental setup and releasing the code.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nIn this paper, the authors proposed a novel framework named the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH-Diffusion) for fMRI analytics. The PDH-Diffusion framework integrates two essential brain physiological properties, hierarchical regional interactions and multifractal dynamics, into the diffusion process. The primary goal is to improve diffusion models’ capability to generate realistic fMRI time series signals by accurately capturing these physiological characteristics.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nOverall, the major strength of this work lies in its novelty. The authors have developed an innovative framework that captures complex interdependencies and multifractal dynamics within synthetic fMRI signals.\n\nSpecifically, their contribution includes integrating three key components into the diffusion process: a hypergraph-based signal generator, a dynamics properties guiding module, and a cross-brain region progressive diffusion model. This integration enhances the realism of the generated signals. The authors provide a robust theoretical foundation for their methods and perform extensive quantitative analysis, demonstrating the framework’s accuracy and effectiveness in time series forecasting. The paper is well-organized and includes relevant background information. Results from the proposed method outperform multiple peer models in time-series forecasting and diffusion models, as evidenced by superior MAE, MAPE, and RMSE scores, highlighting the model’s effectiveness.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe reviewers have multiple concerns about the framework and potential impact in this work. \n\n1). The confusion about physiological fMRI. Usually, fMRI are categorized into resting-state and task-based fMRI. The resting-state fMRI is commonly scanned without specific stimulus, whereas task-based fMRI is acquired based on external stimulus, such as 7 tasks in HCP. Is physiological fMRI is either resting-state or task-based signal? The authors do not clarify the concept even in Introdcution section.\n\n2). Limited motivation and impact. In Abstract, the authors mentioned \"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping brain activity but faces challenges like lengthy acquisition time and sensitivity to patient movement, limiting its clinical and machine learning applications.\" It seems that the authros' work can advance the fMRI for clincial application, but the authors do not generate some neurological or psychiatric fMRI to validate. From reviewers' perspective, using the innovative PDH-Diffusion model, it can assist physician to provide lengthy fMRI signal which will denfinitely reduce the inconvenience of patients. Only generating healthy fMRI can impair the motivation and impact of this work.\n\n3). Lacking of qualitative comparison. The authors have provided an extensive quantitative validation of PDH-Diffusion model with other peer methods using MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. Unfortunately, the autors do not provide any qualitative results, such as Functional Connectivity Map or Brain Connectivity Maps, of PDH-Diffusion. That is, although averaging metrics such as MAE, RMSE, MAPE across 10 runs may demonstrate robustness, these metrics  cannot fully capture the quality or realism of the synthesized fMRI signals. Notably, the qualitative results is also vital in clinics, since these results showcase which brain regions are severly impaired by neurological disorders.  Importantly, there is no visual representation given of the generated fMRI signal, which would be valuable for assessing their plausibility. \n\n4). Several technical issues. The variance schedule (parameters $\\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_n$) in the diffusion process may not be fully optimized for different regions or scales, potentially leading to inappropriate noise levels in certain hierarchical levels. This could result in over-smoothing or overfitting at certain levels. Additionally, conditioning on historical data could lead to overfitting if the model becomes too dependent on past values, especially if the training data does not represent the full spectrum of brain dynamics. Without explicit mitigation measures, such as adaptive variance schedules or regularization techniques, these issues may limit the model’s ability to generalize to new or varied patterns, impacting its robustness and effectiveness.\n\n5). Multiple typographical mistakes. In Section 4.3 (ABLATION ANALYSIS) there are many typographical errors. The term “share radio” is used instead of ‘share ratio’ in “The influence of share radio” this section. Similar typographical errors appear in the caption and text of Figure 3(b), as well as in Section 3.4. These typographical mistakes impair the redability of this paper.\n\n### Questions\n\nThe reviewers have raised several questions regarding the weaknesses of this work:\n\n1). Qualitative Comparisons: The authors are strongly encouraged to provide qualitative comparisons between the synthesized and real fMRI signals to allow for a qualitative assessment of the model’s performance.\n\n2). Optimal Range of Brain Regions: The results suggest an “optimal” range of brain regions that enhances performance. How is this range determined, and is it manually set? Reviewers are concerned about the reliance on manual design for determining this optimal range.\n\n3). Validation of Multifractal Properties: How do the authors validate that the generated signals preserve multifractal properties?\n\n4). Risk of Overfitting: Do the variance schedule parameters ($\\alpha_n$ and $\\beta_n$) and the historical data used in training the PDH-Diffusion model lead to overfitting?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

Then, the authors validated the feasibility of synthesized fMRI data by comparing it to other generative mechanisms. The scientific merit of this work mainly comes from the conceptual advances in their proposed algorithm. It is indeed challenging to synthesize realistic fMRI data while preserving unique aspects of the brain system. The authors combined three different modules, each serving different roles, to synthesize brain dynamics with preserved network-like structure and fractal components. Given results of the extensive validation experiment on the large fMRI cohort, the validity of the proposed algorithm is clear; yet, the scientific significance of this work is somewhat limited as there was no experiment demonstrating the practical usefulness of the proposed algorithm.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe major originality of this study comes from its conceptual advances embedded in the proposed algorithm. It is indeed challenging to synthesize realistic fMRI data while preserving unique aspects of the brain system. The quality and clarity of the models in the main text are reasonably strong as well.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe major concern comes from the unclear significance of this work. As the authors argued in the Introduction, acquisition of fMRI is expensive. Thus, synthesizing fMRI signal can be tempting. Although expensive, real fMRI data reflects unique information of individuals. This study, however, was not able to demonstrate the synthesized fMRI still convey unique information of subjects. Slight improvement in forecasting future timepoints of fMRI signal does not suggest the significance or practical usefulness of the model. This works needs additional analysis or applications highlighting the unique advantage of the synthesized fMRI data from the proposed model.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In table 1, does “T_Pred=32 or 64” mean predicting 32 or 64 time points of fMRI data?\n2. If my speculation in the former question is right, it is counter-intuitive that forecasting more time points (96 vs. 32) did not lead to an increase in errors. Please clarify this. \n3. According to Fig 1, it looks like the resolution of synthesized data is bounded to the level of ROI. It is more desirable to synthesize fMRI dynamics at the level of vertex. Is the proposed method able to be applied at the vertex level as well?     \n4.

Scope & Relevance to IEEE TMI**  \n✅ The paper clearly targets methodological innovation in medical imaging, introducing a new generative modeling framework for *fMRI signal synthesis and forecasting*. It intertwines imaging physics–inspired priors (functional connectivity and fractal dynamics) with modern diffusion-based generative modeling. This lies squarely within TMI’s interest in imaging reconstruction, signal modeling, and quantitative imaging theory.  \n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe “Physiological Dynamics–Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH‑Diffusion)” is an ambitious method integrating multiple physiological priors into a generative diffusion model. There is meaningful novelty in:\n- Coupling functional connectivity–derived *hypergraph structures* with diffusion processes.  \n- Embedding *multifractal dynamics* (generalized Hurst exponent, multifractal spectrum) as explicit conditioning signals.  \n- Using a *progressive multi‑scale diffusion chain* guided by brain‑region hierarchies.  \n\nThe conceptual integration surpasses standard diffusion‑time‑series applications, though the core diffusion machinery is known. Methodological contribution is thus moderate‑to‑strong; the main innovation lies in the *physiological conditioning design*.  \n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe paper is technically dense and mathematically coherent. Derivations of fractal properties are thorough. Experimental validation uses the HCP dataset; the training pipeline and baselines are well‑chosen. However, shortcomings include:\n- Limited discussion of how “physiologically realistic” generation is quantitatively validated beyond forecasting metrics (MAE/RMSE/MAPE).  \n- Absence of uncertainty estimates, reproducibility statistics, or clinical interpretability analysis.  \n- Lack of details about subject variability, test–retest reliability, or whether generated fMRI preserve spatial–temporal physiological realism beyond numeric metrics.  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nGenerally well structured, albeit verbose. Figures are helpful but the writing could be tightened for readability. Derivations may be too detailed for TMI’s page format; clearer schematic flowcharts of the pipeline and loss functions would help.  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nThe dataset (HCP) is public and anonymized; code availability is promised via GitHub.

Summary (in reviewer’s words)**  \nThe authors propose *PDH‑Diffusion*, a hierarchical diffusion model that synthesizes realistic fMRI time‑series. The model fuses three components: (i) a hypergraph‑based hierarchical signal generator modeling multi‑scale functional connectivity among regions; (ii) a dynamics‑guiding module that enforces multifractal temporal behavior via predicted spectra and Hurst exponents; and (iii) a cross‑region progressive diffusion process where coarse‑scale regional trends guide fine‑scale generation. Evaluated on the Human Connectome Project dataset, PDH‑Diffusion reportedly surpasses transformer and diffusion baselines in MAE/RMSE/MAPE metrics.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Strong methodological concept embedding *neurophysiological priors* into machine learning generation.  \n- Mathematically consistent link between fractal brain dynamics and diffusion conditioning.  \n- Clear ablation study validating the role of each module.  \n- Open‑source intent and usage of a widely recognized dataset.  \n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Evaluation metrics focus on generic time‑series accuracy, not physiological or spatial realism; missing evaluation of dynamic functional connectivity preservation.  \n- Clinical or acquisition‑time reduction claims are speculative without empirical evidence.  \n- Hyperparameters and model reproducibility details (e.g., initialization, computational cost) are sparse.  \n- Writing density and formula presentation may impede accessibility for imaging readers.  \n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Validation of physiological realism:** Move beyond numerical forecasting errors; include comparisons of fractal spectra, power‑law slopes, or rsFC statistics between generated and real signals to support the “physiologically realistic” claim.  \n2. **Empirical link to acquisition efficiency:** If the model intends to reduce fMRI acquisition time, demonstrate reconstruction/denoising from undersampled or partial scans rather than only forecasting.  \n3. **Ablation breadth:** Provide qualitative visualization (temporal correlations, autocorrelation, PSD comparisons) to reveal how each module preserves dynamic structure.  \n4. **Reproducibility:** Clarify computational cost per subject, diffusion steps, total parameter count, and inference time.  \n5. **Manuscript condensation:** The theoretical exposition on fractal dynamics (Section 2) is excessive; condensing or relocating into supplementary material would improve readability.  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Figures 1–2: increase font size; delineate modules with clearer color coding.  \n- Verify consistency in notation (e.g., \\(R\\), \\(r\\), \\(σ_r\\)) across sections.  \n- Reference formatting shows unescaped LaTeX; conform to IEEE style.  \n- Typographical errors (“A P HYSIOLOGI -CAL”, “b y r esting-state”) should be corrected.  \n- Future directions could mention potential adaptation to BOLD reconstruction from partially sampled k‑space.  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.**  \nThe work fits TMI’s methodological scope and demonstrates interesting novelty by fusing physiological priors with diffusion modeling. However, the current validation and exposition require significant strengthening—particularly quantitative physiological evaluation, clarity of contributions, and evidence for claimed acquisition efficiency—to meet TMI standards.\n\n**7.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThe paper addresses fMRI acquisition challenges including lengthy scan times and motion sensitivity by proposing the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH-Diffusion) for generating realistic fMRI signals. The method integrates two key brain physiological properties: hierarchical regional interactions modeled through hypergraphs based on resting-state functional connectivity, and multifractal dynamics captured via generalized Hurst exponents and multifractal spectra. The framework comprises three components: a Hypergraph-based Hierarchical Signals Generator that aggregates fMRI signals across multiple spatial scales, a Dynamics Properties Guiding Module that predicts multifractal characteristics to guide diffusion generation, and a Cross-brain Region Guiding Progressive Diffusion Model that uses broader regional signals to condition localized signal generation. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset demonstrate superior performance compared to time series forecasting methods and existing diffusion models across prediction horizons of 32, 64, and 96 timesteps, with ablation studies confirming the contribution of each proposed component.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - Equation 1 defines scale-free property with β≥0 but subsequent derivations assume specific relationships without clear justification (Page 3, Section 2.2)\n  - The transition from Equation 2 to Equation 3 lacks mathematical rigor in establishing the self-similarity property, particularly the equality of finite dimensional distributions notation (Page 3)\n  - Equation 9 combines MSE and KL divergence losses without theoretical justification for this specific combination or guidance on relative weighting (Page 7)\n  - Notation inconsistencies appear throughout, such as using both X(t) and Y(t) for time series without clear distinction of their roles (Pages 3-4)\n\n• **Insufficient experimental validation and baseline comparisons**\n  - Limited to single dataset (HCP) evaluation without cross-dataset validation to demonstrate generalizability (Page 8, Section 4.1)\n  - Missing comparisons with recent fMRI-specific generation methods, focusing only on general time series forecasting and two diffusion models (Table 1, Page 9)\n  -

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript proposes a novel framework, the Physiological Dynamics-Driven Hierarchical Diffusion Model (PDH-Diffusion), aimed at synthesizing realistic fMRI signals by integrating brain regional interactions and multifractal dynamics into the diffusion process. The framework consists of a Hypergraph-based Hierarchical Signals Generator, a Dynamics Properties Guiding Module, and a Cross-brain Region Guiding Progressive Diffusion Model. The authors claim that their method produces physiologically realistic fMRI signals, potentially reducing acquisition time and enhancing data quality. The manuscript is well-written and provides a clear rationale for integrating physiological dynamics into the generation process.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The proposed method is innovative in its integration of multifractal dynamics and hypergraph-based hierarchical structures. However, the manuscript does not sufficiently distinguish itself from existing works that also incorporate physiological priors or utilize hierarchical structures. A more thorough comparison with related methods is needed to establish the novelty and superiority of the proposed framework.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experimental evaluation is conducted exclusively on the HCP dataset, which, while standard, limits the generalizability of the findings. The authors should consider validating their model on additional datasets, including those with different scanning protocols or anatomies, to better demonstrate the robustness and applicability of their approach.\n\n3. Comparisons: The baseline comparisons are somewhat limited, primarily focusing on time series forecasting methods and diffusion models. Including more recent and specialized methods for fMRI synthesis would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance relative to the state of the art.\n\n4. Reproducibility: While the authors state that the code will be made available, the methodology section lacks some crucial details, such as specific training protocols, hyperparameters, and preprocessing steps. These omissions hinder reproducibility and should be addressed.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 2 and 3 are somewhat cluttered and could benefit from clearer labeling and fewer examples per figure. Including zoomed-in sections or more focused examples would enhance readability.\n\n2. Notation and Terminology: Some notation and terminology are introduced without sufficient explanation, particularly in the Preliminaries section. Definitions and explanations should be provided to ensure clarity for readers unfamiliar with the concepts.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., HCP, rsFC) are used without being defined in the text, which can be confusing for readers. Defining these acronyms upon first mention would improve accessibility.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: There are minor typographical errors throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" and \"undersampling maskes,\" which should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in fMRI acquisition by proposing a novel method for generating realistic fMRI signals. The integration of physiological dynamics and hierarchical structures into the diffusion process is technically innovative and has the potential to advance the field. However, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and the comparisons lack breadth, which undermines the claims of significance and generalizability. The reproducibility of the approach is also compromised by the lack of detailed methodological information. Overall, while the idea is promising, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand their comparative analysis, validate their model on additional datasets, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

This study addresses these challenges by generating lesion-containing image-segmentation pairs from lesion-free images. Previous efforts in medical imaging synthesis have struggled with separating lesion information from background, resulting in low-quality backgrounds and limited control over the synthetic output. Inspired by diffusion-based image inpainting, we propose LeFusion, a lesion-focused diffusion model. By redesigning the diffusion learning objectives to focus on lesion areas, we simplify the learning process and improve control over the output while preserving high-fidelity backgrounds by integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. Additionally, we tackle two major challenges in lesion texture synthesis: 1) multi-peak and 2) multi-class lesions. We introduce two effective strategies: histogram-based texture control and multi-channel decomposition, enabling the controlled generation of high-quality lesions in difficult scenarios. Furthermore, we incorporate lesion mask diffusion, allowing control over lesion size, location, and boundary, thus increasing lesion diversity. Validated on 3D cardiac lesion MRI and lung nodule CT datasets, LeFusion-generated data significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art segmentation models, including nnUNet and SwinUNETR.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a novel 3D lesion inpainting method, LeFusion, which uses diffusion models to address data scarcity in medical imaging. Its primary aim is to generate synthetic lesions in lung CT and cardiac MRI scans for augmenting training data in lesion segmentation tasks. The approach is validated through both visual quality assessments and data augmentation derived segmentation \n\nperformance improvement. Three key contributions can be summarised below: \nLeFusion Model: The authors identify that existing lesion inpainting methods struggle to preserve anatomically accurate backgrounds alongside the inpainted lesion, remarking that modelling the former is both hard and unnecessary. LeFusion is introduced to address this challenge incorporating two distinct features: (a) Training on a lesion focused diffusion loss, which only considers the lesion region. (b) Preserving the background at inference time with RePaint [1] by generating the lesion separately, while integrating forward-diffused background contexts into the reverse diffusion process. This design yields realistic lesions, better preserved backgrounds and improves data augmentation outcomes in both CT and MRI compared to non-lesion-specific models (Cond-Diffusion) both with and without RePaint based sampling. \n\nModality-Specific Variants: Two specialized variants are introduced to address modality-specific challenges. LeFusion-H uses histogram-based conditioning to capture diverse lesion textures in CT, succesfully solving the texture mode collapse observed for the baseline LeFusion. LeFusion-J models multiple tissue subtypes in MRI via multi-channel decomposition, which enables the joint generation of different lesion tissue types typically observed in cardiac lesions. Both variants demonstrate superior data augmentation effectiveness in their respective modalities. \n\nDiffMask for Mask Generation: All variants of LeFusion rely on either existing real masks or handcrafted ones as priors for generating lesions in healthy scans. As a more flexible alternative, DiffMask is a diffusion model that generates synthetic lesion masks from basic spatial constraints, defined as a sphere with user specified location and size. Using the generated masks for data augmentation leads to the largest improvement in segmentation performance relative to the baseline in both CT and MRI.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nLesion generating models are tools with significant potential for mitigating bias in medical vision AI algorithms concerning lesion detection, segmentation and quantification. Advancements in this topic should be highlighted in venues like this. \nThe manuscript is sufficiently well written, all the provided Figures/Tables are insightful and adequately formatted. \nThe choice of a 3D method for this inpainting problem is most adequate for CT and MRI. In these modalities, clinical lesion analysis workflows depend on the visualisation of multiple affected slices and 2D slice-wise inpainting methods would lead to slice-wise discontinuities. \n\nThe proposed method is sufficiently contextualised in the Introduction and Related work sections, where the reseach gap is clearly defined. Beyond that, this gap is empirically demonstrated by experimenting with state-of-the-art approaches (Cond-Diffusion variants and RePaint). \n\nThe proposed methodologies are thoroughly evaluated through comparisons with multiple other approaches, focusing on visual inspection of inpainted lesions (including comparison with real lesions) and their their downstream usability for training segmentation models. The latter evaluation used two different segmentation models, which contributes to the robustness of the findings across different segmentation training strategies. In addition, evaluating the approach on both MRI and CT datasets, ensures that the findings are not only applicable to one imaging domain. \n\nThis paper provides multiple key contributions which not only address the research gap but also deal with modality specific challenges related to lesion texture and shape heterogeneity. The corresponding claims are well supported by the results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nWhile S4, the Introduction and Background sections seem to imply that the proposed lesion focused loss is a novel contribution proposed for the first time by the authors. This might not be necessarily true considering that there have been other works that employ similar approaches [2, 3]. While few and perhaps not as thoroughly evaluated, mentioning them could further strengthen the contextualisation of the approach. \n\nThe description of the RePaint method in the experimental section implicitly suggests it consists of Cond-Diffusion using the RePaint [1] inference scheme. If that is the case it should be mentioned explicitly, if not then it should be better described. \nIn the segmentation experiments, it is understood that masks priors for generating lesions in healthy scans (N’) are either derived from real masks, handcrafted or generated by DiffMask. However, additional information should be provided on how exactly the conditioning histograms in this N’ setting are selected when using LeFusion-H variants. \n\nRegarding DiffMask, the definition and role of boundary mask is not very clear. From Figure 4, it is presumed that it corresponds to the bounding box defining the volume crop centred on the lesion. However, the statement “The boundary mask removes areas outside the boundary at each diffusion step” challenges this concept. Further clarity on this point would be appreciated. Furthermore, it is only implicit, that the DiffMask takes the CT/MRI volume crop as an input in addition to the conditioning control sphere. Section 3.3. should be updated to enhance clarity on all these aspects. \n\nAdding supplementary details on how the model training and checkpoint selection was conducted for the RePaint, Cond-Diffusion, Cond-Diffusion (L) would improve transparency. \n \n[Minor]\t \nMore detail on the dataset preprocessing would be beneficial for further reproducibility. A mention to the volume resolution is particularly lacking. \n\nThe choice of the specific crop-size could be further supported on previous work, for instance [4]. In addition, while not critical for acceptance, it would be interesting to study its effect over the results and would maybe answer the question: “How much local context is it necessary to generate realistic lesion?” \n\nWhile the purpose of the inpainted lesions is for downstream model training, further validating them using a radiologist would safeguard from potential biases that the generative model might be introducing the lesions. \n\nWhile describing Tables 1 and 2 it would be useful to clarify what is considered as “significant”. Since no standard deviations were provided, it is implied that these results were obtained for a single fold, so the concept of significance here is vague. In addition, while S5, the robustness of these findings to the specific data split could still be reinforced by adopting some sort of cross validation strategy. \nThe authors left unclear whether the segmentation model was trained on the volume crops centred on the lesion or on the entire scans. From using the Copy-Paste method in the evaluation, the latter is presumed but it is not explicitly mentioned. \n\nIn the cardiac MRI experiments, the LeFusion baseline of modelling the two lesion tissue types with separate models is mentioned as LeFusion in Table 2 but as LeFusion-S in Figure 5 and in the Appendix. It is suggested that the authors stick to one terminology. \nAs a work mainly focusing on specific diffusion model mechanics for improved lesion inpainting, it makes sense that the evaluation focus on comparing different diffusion based methods. That said, it would still be interesting to see how GAN based approaches like [4, 5] would fair in this comparison. \n \nReferences:  \n[1] Lugmayr, Andreas, et al. \"Repaint: Inpainting using denoising diffusion probabilistic models.\" Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition. 2022. \n[2] Hansen, Colin, et al. \"Inpainting Pathology in Lumbar Spine MRI with Latent Diffusion.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2406.02477 (2024). \n[3] Rouzrokh, Pouria, et al. \"Multitask brain tumor inpainting with diffusion models: A methodological report.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:2210.12113 (2022). \n[4] Yang, Jie, et al. \"Class-aware adversarial lung nodule synthesis in CT images.\" 2019 IEEE 16th International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2019).

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe authors introduce a latent diffusion model-based method for inserting lesions into healthy medical images while also providing an accompanying mask. They utilize a number of additions to their model to address limitations of prior work or naïve approaches to this task (both pre-existing and seemingly novel), such as combining forward-diffused backgrounds with reverse-diffused foregrounds, introducing intensity histogram-conditioning to the diffusion model to control lesion texture, as well as techniques for further control of the shape, size etc. of the generated lesion. They evaluate their method for a variety of experimental scenarios on 3D cardiac MRI lesion and CT lung nodule generation, showing that their technique results in noticeable improvements to existing approaches with respect to using their generated data to train downstream task segmentation models.\n\n### Soundness: 4\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nMajor\n1. The paper is polished, well-written and well-presented. Topics and concepts are organized and presented in a digestible fashion.\n2. Overall, decent technical novelty. This incorporates many techniques which all come together to result in a strongly-performing methods, some pre-existing (such as combined noised backgrounds with denoised foregrounds), and some seemingly novel (such as histogram-based textural control). Also, despite the many components, the approach still seems relatively watertight because these additions are all pretty lightweight/simple (a good thing). No requirement for an additional network or something of that sort.\n3. Overall, results are strong. Clear improvements over baseline methods is basically all cases, using reasonable metrics. They also study a range of training settings, which is good. Clear improvements over Cond-Diffusion, which would be the naïve approach that many would think of first trying for this task; the limitations of it as discussed in the introduction are clear from the experiments.\n4. They also have fairly extensive ablation studies for their method, which is important given the number of components that they propose using. There are still a few related questions that I have, but they are minor.\n5. In general, the evaluation is fair and appropriate. The datasets are challenging benchmarks, and I think two is sufficient given the wide range of experiments completed on them. There is also a good number of baseline models, especially considering that this task is relatively niche, so the methodological baselines that they compare to seem strong.\n\nMinor\n1. The motivation for this problem is clear: pathological subjects are indeed rare, especially for screening populations. Your survey of the limitations of existing lesion synthesis approaches also supports the motivation; for example, they result in low quality backgrounds, they lack precise control over generated lesions, etc.\n2. The use of a histogram representation to condition the model on may seem too reductive for some applications, but it seems to work well here (makes sense given the clear correspondence between histogram shape/number of peaks and generated lesion morphology shown in Fig. 3), supported by the clear improvement to your method that including the -H module produced.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nMajor\n1. Some limitations of impact/scope: This task is clinically important but still fairly niche in medical image analysis, which itself is fairly niche within general machine learning and computer vision. The method (and task itself) also requires that dataset used needs the required annotations, which many medical datasets may not possess, and can be expensive/time-consuming to acquire. Overall, these limit the impact of the work somewhat, in the context of an ML conference at the level of ICLR, compared to a venue a bit more niche like MICCAI.\n\nMinor\n1. The benefits from using multi-channel decomposition (comparing the \"-J\" to no \"-J\" variants of your model in Table 2) are quite small. Can you provide some analysis or discussion of why this is the case, even if just hypothesizing? (However, I am guessing that the computational requirement to adding this component is practically negligible, so there is not really any harm in including it even if it results in only a very small performance improvement.)\n2. You state in the abstract that synthesizing multi-peak and multi-class lesions is a \"major challenge\" I agree with the multi-peak case given how much your histogram-conditioning improved the generation of such lesions, but based on your channel decomposition module's only very small improvements to performance, I'm unsure if generating multi-class lesions could not already be done well by prior methods. Could you clarify this/point to your results that support this, and/or provide quantitative evidence that multi-class synthesis is challenging for prior approaches?\n\nTo summarize, the paper is methodologically solid, with some technical novelty, and demonstrates clear improvements to prior techniques for lesion generation tasks in medical images via well-designed experiments and baselines. However, the main limitation is just that the task is relatively niche within medical image ML, which makes it more niche within general ML, and so may be less impactful at a venue like ICLR as opposed to a medical imaging-focused venue such as MICCAI or MIDL. Still, these limitations do not take away the good things about the paper (of which there are many), so I vote for a marginal accept.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In the tables (e.g. table 1), what do you mean by the significantly adverse/positive effects denoted by red/blue? Could you please clarify this in the text as well via a small note in the table caption(s)?\n2. My suggestion: move image quality assessment quantitative results in the appendix (Table A2) to the main text if you have room. These are important metrics. You can shorten the related works to make space, that section doesn't need to be quite so extensive (or some of it could be moved to the supplementary).\n    - Also, why didn't you evaluate unpaired perceptual metrics like FID, KID (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01401), SWD (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196) etc.? the first two may have limitations for this task given that they use pretrained natural image features, but despite this they are still commonly used metrics for generative medical image models. I would consider adding these for future work, and also explaining why they are not used (particularly for the wider ICLR audience).\n3. For the multiclass lesion case/-J model, did you study how performance/generation quality scales with adding more classes? This point may be a bit moot given how small the changes in performance were measured after adding the channel decomposition module to the base model, but I'm still curious.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 5",

Previous research on medical image synthesis has primarily concentrated on lesion generation design, often overlooking high-fidelity background preservation. The authors propose a lesion-focused diffusion model, LeFusion, which maintains high-fidelity background by integrating the background from forward diffusion into the reverse diffusion process, thus simplifying the learning process and improving output control. Additionally, two effective strategies are introduced: histogram-based texture control and multi-channel decomposition to address the two main challenges in lesion texture synthesis: 1) multimodal and 2) multiclass lesions.

It presents a new generative modeling framework (LeFusion) for lesion synthesis in medical imaging, focusing on algorithmic innovation rather than pure application. By modifying diffusion model objectives to isolate lesion synthesis and maintain background fidelity, it contributes to the growing area of generative modeling for medical image augmentation, reconstruction, and fairness — all core interests of TMI.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe paper introduces several methodologically distinct components:\n- Reformulated diffusion process combining forward-diffused background and reverse-diffused lesion inference.\n- A lesion-focused training objective (mask-weighted diffusion loss).\n- Histogram-based texture control for multi-peak lesion synthesis.\n- Multi-channel decomposition for simultaneous multi-class lesion generation.\n- Lesion mask diffusion (DiffMask) for synthesizing controllable lesion masks.\n\nWhile the paper builds conceptually on existing diffusion and inpainting frameworks, its lesion-specific reformulation and multi-level control mechanisms appear novel and well-motivated. The scope is broader than an incremental application; it introduces a coherent set of algorithmic innovations intended to generalize across modalities.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe work demonstrates a high level of technical rigor:\n- Mathematical formulations are clearly defined.  \n- Both 3D CT and MRI validation are performed.  \n- Quantitative evaluation includes Dice, NSD, FID/KID/SWD, and PSNR/SSIM, with comparisons to multiple baselines.  \n- Downstream segmentation tasks strengthen the argument for clinical utility.  \nAreas that could be improved:\n  - Reproducibility would benefit from open, verified code links.  \n  - Statistical tests or confidence intervals on segmentation improvements would solidify claims.  \n  - The use of recurrent inference and control parameter selection could be explained theoretically.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nGenerally clear and logically organized, though the paper is dense. The figures (e.g., Fig. 1–4) are informative but could be simplified for readability. The writing style is occasionally verbose, and consistent terminology (“LeFusion-H/J/S”) could be better introduced. English usage is sound with minor grammatical issues.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \n✅ Ethical compliance is satisfactory. Only public datasets (LIDC, Emidec) are used; privacy and IRB concerns are addressed. The reproducibility statement is strong, promising open-source release with detailed documentation.\n\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe manuscript proposes *LeFusion*, a diffusion-based generative framework designed to synthesize realistic lesion-containing image–mask pairs from normal medical scans. Unlike standard conditional diffusion models that generate entire images, LeFusion focuses the diffusion process on lesion regions while reusing forward-diffused real backgrounds to ensure anatomical consistency. It introduces histogram-based texture control for multi-modal lesion textures, multi-channel decomposition for multiple lesion categories, and a lesion mask diffusion (DiffMask) mechanism enabling control over lesion size and location.  \nThe method is validated on lung CT (LIDC) and cardiac MRI (Emidec), showing improved segmentation performance over conventional synthesis approaches and other diffusion frameworks.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clearly defined methodological novelty beyond prior diffusion/inpainting work.  \n- Comprehensive experimental validation across modalities.  \n- Effective demonstration of downstream benefit with segmentation models (nnUNet, SwinUNETR).  \n- Conceptually elegant solution to background preservation using background-forward diffusion.  \n- Thoughtful design of control mechanisms (texture, mask, class).  \n- Open reproducibility plan and ethical transparency.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Though novel, the improvements in diffusion formulation remain largely empirical; limited theoretical justification for loss weighting and convergence behavior.  \n- No statistical significance analysis for segmentation improvements.  \n- Comparison limited to diffusion-based baselines; GAN-based or transformer-based generative models might offer complementary benchmarks.  \n- Some sections are repetitive or overly lengthy; a more concise presentation would aid readability.  \n- Qualitative examples mainly show improved realism but lack blinded reader studies.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Quantitative robustness** – Include confidence intervals or statistical tests (e.g., paired t-tests) on segmentation improvements to validate significance.  \n2. **Ablation justification** – While variants (H/J/S) are tested, a structured ablation isolating each design element (histogram control, mask diffusion, multi-channel) would strengthen claims.  \n3. **Theoretical grounding** – Provide deeper analysis of why lesion-focused learning improves convergence or fidelity. Discuss trade-offs in model capacity vs. region focus.  \n4. **Comparative scope** – Consider discussing performance relative to non-diffusion generative modalities (e.g., GAN or transformer generators) to clarify generalizability.  \n5. **Reproducibility link** – Ensure code and pretrained weights are fully accessible with exact experiment scripts before publication.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Minor typos: e.g., “b ackgrounds b y i ntegrating” (abstract).  \n- Figure 1 labeling could be simplified; arrows and sub-panels could be clearer.  \n- Define abbreviation “NSD” on first use.  \n- Clarify “control sphere” terminology; consider merging with “bounding sphere.”  \n- Reference formatting: remove redundant “inConference” artifacts.  \n- Some results tables (Tabs. 1–2) could use visual grouping or highlight improvements more clearly.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation:**  \n**Major Revision**  \nThe paper is well-aligned with *IEEE TMI* scope and shows strong potential for publishability. However, to reach TMI’s methodological and scientific rigor, the authors should better quantify improvement significance, streamline presentation, and add theoretical or statistical validation. With these enhancements, the paper would make a meaningful contribution to generative modeling for medical imaging.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 5 (High)\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nLeFusion offers clear methodological advances in lesion-focused diffusion modeling for medical image synthesis, presenting solid empirical evidence across modalities. With added statistical rigor and improved clarity, it could meet *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*’s standards for methodological innovation.",

The method combines forward-diffused backgrounds with reverse-diffused foregrounds while training only on lesion regions (Figure 1). Key contributions include histogram-based texture control for multi-peak lesions, multi-channel decomposition for multi-class lesions, and lesion mask diffusion (DiffMask) for controlling size, location, and boundary. The approach is validated on lung nodule CT (LIDC dataset) and cardiac lesion MRI (Emidec dataset), demonstrating improvements in downstream segmentation performance with nnUNet and SwinUNETR models. Results show Dice score improvements of up to 5.18% for lung nodules and enhanced performance for cardiac lesions compared to baseline and competing methods (Tables 1-2).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and unclear notation**\n  - Equation (3) uses element-wise multiplication (⊙) but the dimensions of ot−1 and ˆxt−1 are not clearly established to ensure compatibility, particularly in the multi-channel case where dimensions expand to RD×H×W×n (Page 4-5)\n  - The relationship between β̄t and βt in Equation (2) is defined inconsistently - β̄t is defined as ∏ts=1(1−βs) but standard notation typically uses ᾱt for this cumulative product (Page 4)\n  - Equation (7-8) in Appendix C introduces parameters r, s, p, q without proper definition of their values or how they are determined, making the histogram control mechanism theoretically unclear (Page 16)\n\n• **Inadequate experimental validation and comparison methodology**\n  - The comparison with Cond-Diffusion (L) relies on \"fine-tuned open-source code\" rather than implementing the method under identical conditions, introducing potential implementation bias (Page 8, Section 4.1)\n  - Dataset splits are small with only 10 test cases for cardiac lesions (Emidec), limiting statistical significance of reported improvements (Page 7, Section 4.1)\n  - No statistical significance testing is provided for the reported performance improvements, despite claims of \"significant\" effects marked in blue/red in tables (Tables 1-2)\n  - The evaluation focuses primarily on segmentation downstream tasks but lacks direct assessment of lesion realism through clinical expert evaluation\n\n• **Technical approach limitations and unclear design choices**\n  - The lesion-focused loss in Equation (4) applies masking only during training but the paper doesn't adequately address how this affects the model's ability to generate coherent lesion-background transitions during inference (Page 5, Section 3.1)\n  - The histogram-based texture control method lacks theoretical justification for why histogram matching should preserve lesion authenticity, and the clustering into three groups (Figure 3) appears arbitrary without validation (Page 5, Figure 3)\n  - Multi-channel decomposition strategy doesn't explain how channel correlations are enforced beyond simple summation, potentially leading to unrealistic multi-class lesion combinations (Page 6, Equation 6)\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and standardize mathematical notation**\n  - Provide explicit dimensional analysis for all tensor operations, particularly showing how ot−1 ∈ RD×H×W×n and ˆxt−1 ∈ RD×H×W×n are compatible in Equation (3) for both single and multi-channel cases\n  - Use standard diffusion model notation (ᾱt instead of β̄t) and provide clear definitions of all variance schedule parameters with their typical ranges\n  - Include a complete mathematical derivation of the histogram control mechanism with explicit parameter definitions and their optimization procedure\n\n• **Strengthen experimental design and validation**\n  - Implement all comparison methods from scratch using identical training conditions, hyperparameters, and computational resources to ensure fair comparison\n  - Expand the cardiac lesion dataset or provide cross-validation results to increase statistical power, and include confidence intervals for all reported metrics\n  - Conduct statistical significance tests (t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests) for all performance comparisons and remove subjective \"significant effect\" color coding without statistical backing\n  - Include clinical expert evaluation studies to assess lesion realism and diagnostic relevance of synthetic images\n\n• **Address technical gaps and provide better justification**\n  - Conduct ablation studies showing how the lesion-focused loss affects boundary quality and provide quantitative metrics for lesion-background transition coherence\n  - Validate the histogram clustering approach through medical domain knowledge, compare with established lesion classification schemes, and show that three clusters capture meaningful clinical distinctions\n  - Develop and evaluate explicit correlation modeling mechanisms for multi-channel decomposition, such as attention mechanisms or learned channel interaction layers, with quantitative assessment of multi-class lesion co-occurrence patterns",

The model aims to address the challenges of data scarcity and long-tail imbalances in medical imaging datasets by integrating lesion-specific texture control and multi-channel decomposition for handling multi-class lesions. The authors validate their approach on 3D cardiac lesion MRI and lung nodule CT datasets, demonstrating improvements in downstream segmentation tasks. The manuscript is well-written and provides a thorough exploration of the proposed method's technical aspects and empirical evaluations.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the manuscript presents a novel approach to lesion synthesis, it is essential to clarify how LeFusion differentiates itself from existing methods. The authors should provide a more detailed discussion on how their method compares conceptually and empirically to recent works on lesion synthesis, particularly those that also use diffusion models or incorporate background preservation techniques.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily conducted on two datasets, LIDC for lung nodules and Emidec for cardiac lesions. While these datasets are standard, the validation could be strengthened by including additional datasets or anatomies to demonstrate the generalizability of LeFusion. Moreover, the inclusion of prospective undersampling scenarios would provide a more robust assessment of the method's practical utility.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript includes comparisons with several baseline methods, including hand-crafted approaches and diffusion-based models. However, it is unclear why certain relevant diffusion-based methods are omitted. Including a broader range of competitive baselines would help establish the relative advantages of LeFusion.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The reproducibility statement mentions that the code and model will be made available. However, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters, which are crucial for independent reproduction of the results. Providing more comprehensive documentation would significantly enhance the reproducibility of the work.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figure Clarity: Some figures, particularly Figures 3 and 6, are somewhat cluttered. Simplifying these figures by focusing on fewer representative examples and including zoomed-in regions would improve readability.\n\n2. Notation Consistency: The introduction of notation in Section 2.1 lacks sufficient explanation. In particular, the forward operator is introduced inconsistently, which may confuse readers.\n\n3. Acronym Definitions: Several acronyms, such as \"R=4,\" are used without definitions. Explicitly defining these acronyms would aid in comprehension.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical errors exist throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). These should be corrected to maintain clarity.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical imaging: the scarcity and imbalance of pathological data. LeFusion introduces a novel approach to lesion synthesis by focusing on lesion-specific textures and multi-class lesions, which could be a meaningful innovation. However, the evaluation is limited to a narrow set of datasets and anatomies, which reduces the claim of significance and generalizability. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods is thorough but could be expanded to include additional competitive baselines. Reproducibility is addressed, but the manuscript would benefit from more detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and training protocols. Overall, while the idea has promise, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, broaden the validation across datasets and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

However, transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks, such as lesion segmentation in 3D CT scans, remains a critical challenge. Due to the complexity and variability of pathological visual characteristics, existing methods struggle to align fine-grained lesion features not encountered during training with disease-related textual representations. In this paper, we present Malenia, a novel multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment framework, specifically designed for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation. Malenia improves the compatibility between mask representations and their associated elemental attributes, explicitly linking the visual features of unseen lesions with the extensible knowledge learned from previously seen ones. Furthermore, we design a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to enhance both visual and textual features with mutually beneficial information, effectively guiding the generation of segmentation results. Comprehensive experiments across three datasets and 12 lesion categories validate the superior performance of Malenia.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces Malenia, a framework for zero-shot lesion segmentation in 3D medical images, aimed at addressing the challenge of transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level segmentation tasks. Building on advancements in medical vision-language pre-training, Malenia integrates a multi-scale mask-attribute alignment framework and a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection module to link visual and textual features, enabling the model to handle previously unseen lesions. The authors evaluate Malenia's performance through experiments on three datasets (two public and one private) across 12 lesion categories.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 4\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The topic on zero-shot lesion segmentation is valuable, as clinical settings often involve diverse, emerging anomalies, and data collection is challenging, increasing the need for models that handle unseen diseases in an open-set context.\n2. The authors strengthen their claims with both qualitative and quantitative results, enhancing the credibility of their findings and providing a well-rounded evaluation of the proposed approach.\n3. The paper is well-organized, with a clear and logical structure that makes complex concepts accessible and easy to follow for readers.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The Zero-Shot Inference section lacks sufficient detail on how the model handles test CT images containing unseen tumor types. For instance, if a test image includes both a kidney tumor and a gallbladder tumor, it is unclear how the model predicts these different tumors within the same image. Additionally, the phrase “we obtain the class information for each predicted lesion mask by referencing a clinical knowledge table” is ambiguous. Further clarification is needed on what this clinical knowledge table entails and how it is used in the inference process.\n2. The comparisons in Table 1 and Table 2 may not be entirely fair. The authors introduce additional ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS annotations, which provide extra information not available to baseline methods like TransUNet, nnUNet, and Swin UNETR. These baselines rely solely on image data, while the proposed approach leverages attribute annotations, giving it an advantage in performance comparisons.\n3. The fully-supervised performance of baseline methods reported in Table 2 appears unusually low. For instance, in the official nnUNet paper, liver tumor segmentation achieved a Dice score of 76 on the test set, whereas the presented result here is only 61.33. Similarly, lung tumor segmentation originally reported a Dice score of 74, but this paper reports 54.44. This discrepancy raises concerns about the reproducibility and fairness of the comparisons.\n4. In Table 7, the authors compare their method to existing vision-language pretraining strategies, but it is unclear how these methods were reproduced. Most vision-language pretraining approaches require access to diagnostic reports, which are not included in the public MSD and KiTS23 datasets. It would be helpful to understand how the authors conducted these comparisons without complete diagnostic reports. Additionally, the absence of comparisons with important pretraining models like CT-CLIP weakens the evaluation.\n5.

The Zero-Shot Inference section lacks detailed explanations on how the model manages test CT images with different unseen tumor types.

The introduction of additional ATTRIBUTE DESCRIPTIONS provides extra insight that baseline methods such as TransUNet, nnUNet, and Swin UNETR lack, as they rely solely on image data.\n3. The reported fully-supervised performance of baseline methods in Table 2 appears to be lower than expected based on previous literature, which raises concerns regarding reproducibility and fairness in these comparisons.

The authors aim to address the challenges of transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level tasks—such as lesion segmentation—by proposing a multi-scale lesion-level mask-attribute alignment approach. Malenia improves the alignment between the visual features of unseen lesions with textual representations, leveraging Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI) to enhance both visual and textual embeddings. Experimental results across three datasets demonstrate that Malenia outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in zero-shot lesion segmentation.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed Malenia framework is novel, particularly in its use of multi-scale mask-attribute alignment for 3D lesion segmentation. This is a meaningful extension of zero-shot segmentation methods to the medical domain, where unseen lesion categories are common (e.g., \"hepatocellular carcinoma,\" mentioned in Sec. 1).\n2. The CMKI module is a strong contribution because it combines visual and textual embeddings, enriching the segmentation prediction with complementary information from both modalities. This is a novel approach that enhances the zero-shot capability of the model.\n3. The paper introduces a multi-positive contrastive loss to fine-tune the alignment between lesion masks and textual attributes. This approach allows the model to generalize better to unseen lesions by learning from shared visual attributes, which distinguishes it from prior works like SAM (Kirillov et al., 2023).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The method relies on transforming patient reports into structured descriptions of eight visual attributes, which requires expert radiologist involvement. This process may not be scalable or practical in real-world applications where such annotations are not readily available.\n2. As noted in Appendix D, the model performs less effectively on attributes requiring complex visual semantic understanding, such as \"Surface Characteristics\" and \"Specific Features\". This suggests a potential limitation in capturing intricate visual patterns.\n3. While the model shows strong performance on 12 lesion categories, the diversity of lesions in clinical practice is vast. The ability of Malenia to generalize to a wider range of unseen lesions without additional training remains uncertain.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In Section 3.1, the authors employ the Multi-Positive InfoNCE (MP-NCE) loss for aligning mask embeddings with multiple attribute embeddings. Could the authors provide more details on how the MP-NCE loss is computed and how it facilitates learning with multiple positive pairs? Specifically, how are the positive and negative pairs defined in the context of multiple attributes?\n   Could the authors explain how this formulation effectively handles multiple positive pairs for each mask token?\n2. The model uses a fixed number of mask tokens ($N=16$) and defines $R=8$ attribute aspects. Have the authors conducted any experiments to assess how varying $N$ or the number of attributes affects the model's performance? An ablation study on these hyperparameters could provide insights into the model's sensitivity and optimal settings.\n3. As noted in Appendix D, the model performs less well on attributes like \"Surface Characteristics\" and \"Specific Features\". What are the potential reasons for this lower performance? Could incorporating additional contextual information or advanced features help the model better capture complex visual semantics?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The contribution squarely targets core topics of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*: imaging informatics, segmentation methodology, and cross‑modal learning in radiology.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe paper claims two central technical novelties:  \n- **Multi‑scale mask‑attribute alignment** bridging global image–text pre‑training and dense voxel‑level prediction.  \n- **Cross‑Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI)** to jointly update mask and text embeddings.  \nWhile the work builds on existing transformer backbones (Mask2Former) and CLIP‑style pre‑training concepts, the formulation of *multi‑positive contrastive alignment using structured radiology attributes* is original and represents a meaningful extension beyond prior ZePT or SAM‑based pipelines. Novelty is moderate‑to‑high for TMI, assuming reproducibility and dataset access are adequate.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nExperiments are comprehensive: three datasets (MSD, KiTS23, and a private cohort, totaling 12 lesion types) and extensive ablations, including attribute construction, CMKI design, hyper‑parameter studies, and comparisons to multiple baselines. The methodology is mathematically consistent. However:  \n- The reproducibility of the *semi‑automatic attribute extraction* pipeline using GPT‑4 plus radiologist correction could be better documented (e.g., inter‑rater agreement, automation error rate).  \n- Public availability of the processed attribute annotations is only promised, not confirmed.  \n- Assertions regarding clinical interpretability and “diagnostic precision” might be slightly overstated without expert reader studies.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nOverall well organized, technically clear, and grammatically sound. Figures are dense but informative; minor language editing would improve readability (inconsistent capitalization and spacing, e.g., “Z ERO -SHOT,” “P ancreas”). The manuscript length is high but proportional to complexity.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nEthics statements for the private dataset are provided; anonymization appears sound.

The approach integrates structured radiology attributes (e.g., shape, density, enhancement status) into a **multi‑scale mask‑attribute alignment** loss and introduces a **Cross‑Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI)** module that fuses fine‑grained visual and textual embeddings to improve segmentation of both seen and unseen diseases. Evaluation on multiple public and private CT datasets demonstrates superior Dice and NSD scores compared with SAM‑based and prior vision‑language segmentation models.\n\n2. **Strengths**\n- Addresses an important and underexplored problem: zero‑shot lesion segmentation in 3D medical imaging.  \n- Methodologically innovative: multi‑positive contrastive learning using structured attribute tokens, and bi‑directional feature fusion.  \n- Extensive quantitative and qualitative validation, including ablations and fine‑tuning analyses.  \n- Strong empirical improvement over state‑of‑the‑art baselines.  \n- Clear ethical protocol and commitment to releasing attribute annotations.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**\n- The reliance on proprietary LLMs (GPT‑4) for attribute extraction limits reproducibility; minimal quantification of annotation accuracy.  \n- The architecture largely inherits from Mask2Former/nnUNet; theoretical justification for losses and hyperparameters is empirical rather than analytical.  \n- Discussion of clinical utility remains speculative—no reader study or uncertainty quantification.  \n- Minor clarity issues and formatting inconsistencies.  \n\n4. **Major Comments**\n1. **Reproducibility of Attribute Generation:** Provide quantitative assessment of LLM‑based attribute extraction (e.g., consistency with radiologist edits, κ‑scores) and describe how these structured attributes might generalize across institutions.  \n2. **Statistical Validation:** Include significance testing for Dice/NSD improvements to substantiate “state‑of‑the‑art” claims.  \n3. **Ablation Transparency:** Clarify the relative contribution of CMKI vs. multi‑positive loss on the same training split; consider a formal cross‑validation summary instead of selective examples.  \n4. **Clinical Interpretability:** The claim that Malenia “identifies specific disease categories via a knowledge table” borders on diagnostic inference; specify that this is attribute‑driven label matching, not verified clinical diagnosis.  \n5. **Open‑Source and Data Access:** Specify timelines and scope of planned code and attribute releases to meet IEEE data‑availability expectations.\n\n5. **Minor Comments**\n- Normalize typographic artifacts (e.g., hyphenation, mixed uppercase).  \n- Improve figure readability—Figure 1 and 2 contain small fonts.  \n- Provide network parameter counts per module in supplemental for clarity.  \n- Verify that all references cited as 2024 preprints are in acceptable public form.\n\n6. **Overall Recommendation**  \n**⭑ Major Revision** – The manuscript exhibits strong methodological novelty and promising results, aligning well with TMI's scope. However, additional substantiation of reproducibility, statistical rigor, and clearer separation of methodological versus application claims are required before acceptance.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** **4 / 5** – High confidence in the technical evaluation, moderate uncertainty about dataset and annotation reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \n*Malenia* represents a creative and potentially influential step toward cross‑modal zero‑shot segmentation in 3D medical imaging.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents Malenia, a vision-language pre-training framework for 3D zero-shot lesion segmentation in CT scans. The method addresses the challenge of transferring image-level knowledge to pixel-level segmentation tasks by introducing multi-scale mask-attribute alignment and a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI) module. The approach decomposes medical reports into eight structured visual attributes (location, shape, density, etc.) and aligns these with mask representations at multiple scales using a multi-positive contrastive loss. The CMKI module enhances both visual and textual features through cross-attention mechanisms. Experiments across three datasets (MSD, KiTS23, in-house) and 12 lesion categories demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, with improvements of 6.40% DSC on MSD, 8.14% on KiTS23, and 9.08% on the in-house dataset over the best competing method.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - Equation (2) defines the multi-positive contrastive loss but lacks clear explanation of how the expectation over positive pairs is computed in practice (Section 3.1, Page 5), which affects reproducibility\n  - The notation S(m_j, t_k) = m_j·t_k/τ assumes normalized embeddings but this normalization is not explicitly stated (Section 3.1, Page 5), creating ambiguity in implementation\n  - The scaling factor √C in Equation (5) lacks justification for why this specific normalization is chosen over alternatives (Section 3.2, Page 6), undermining theoretical grounding\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - The private dataset contains only 30 cases per lesion type (Table 5, Page 16), which is insufficient for robust evaluation of zero-shot generalization capabilities\n  - Cross-validation methodology is inconsistent across datasets, with 5-fold cross-validation only reported for seen lesions (Table 2, Page 9) but not for unseen lesions, limiting statistical reliability\n  - The comparison with SAM-based methods may be unfair as they require manual prompts during testing (Table 1, Page 8), while Malenia uses stored embeddings from training, creating different evaluation conditions\n\n• **Technical approach and novelty concerns**\n  - The multi-scale alignment strategy lacks theoretical justification for why three specific resolution levels (H/32, W/32, D/32) to (H/8, W/8, D/8) are optimal (Section 3.1, Page 4), appearing arbitrary\n  - The eight visual attributes are derived from expert consultation but lack systematic validation or comparison with alternative attribute taxonomies (Section 3.1, Page 4), questioning their generalizability\n  - The CMKI module design shows limited novelty as it primarily combines standard cross-attention and self-attention mechanisms (Equation 3, Page 6) without significant architectural innovation\n\n• **Data dependency and generalization issues**\n  - The method requires extensive manual annotation by radiologists to create structured attribute descriptions (Section B.2, Page 16), which may not scale to diverse clinical settings\n  - The clinical knowledge table used during inference (Table 11, Page 25) appears manually crafted and disease-specific, potentially limiting generalization to new lesion types not covered in the predefined taxonomy\n  - The semi-automatic pipeline using GPT-4 for attribute extraction introduces dependency on proprietary models (Section 3.1, Page 5), raising concerns about reproducibility and accessibility\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and implementation clarity**\n  - Explicitly state the normalization requirements for embeddings in the similarity computation and provide pseudocode for the multi-positive contrastive loss implementation\n  - Justify the choice of √C scaling factor by comparing with alternative normalization schemes (e.g., temperature scaling, learnable parameters) in ablation studies\n  - Include detailed derivations or references for the mathematical formulations to ensure reproducibility and theoretical soundness\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation and statistical rigor**\n  - Increase the private dataset size to at least 100 cases per lesion type or provide power analysis justifying the current sample size for meaningful statistical conclusions\n  - Apply consistent cross-validation methodology across all experiments, including confidence intervals and statistical significance tests for performance comparisons\n  - Conduct fair comparisons by either providing manual prompts for SAM-based methods or developing prompt-free versions of competing approaches\n\n• **Provide systematic justification for technical choices**\n  - Conduct ablation studies on different numbers of resolution levels and specific scale choices to demonstrate the optimality of the current multi-scale design\n  - Compare the proposed eight-attribute taxonomy with alternative attribute sets through systematic evaluation or provide theoretical frameworks for attribute selection\n  - Benchmark the CMKI module against other cross-modal fusion strategies (e.g., early fusion, late fusion, attention-based fusion) to demonstrate its superiority\n\n• **Address scalability and accessibility limitations**\n  - Develop automated or semi-automated methods for attribute extraction that reduce dependency on manual annotation and proprietary models\n  - Create a systematic framework for expanding the clinical knowledge table to new lesion types, potentially using hierarchical or embedding-based approaches\n  - Provide open-source alternatives to GPT-4 for attribute extraction and validate their effectiveness in maintaining segmentation performance",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces Malenia, a novel framework for zero-shot 3D lesion segmentation that leverages vision-language pre-training and incorporates a multi-scale mask-attribute alignment strategy. The proposed method bridges the gap between global image-level representations and fine-grained pixel-level segmentation tasks by aligning lesion mask representations with elemental disease attributes extracted from structured medical reports. Additionally, Malenia introduces a Cross-Modal Knowledge Injection (CMKI) module to enhance both visual and textual feature representations, further refining the segmentation process. The paper is well-written, and the authors provide comprehensive experimental results across three datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of Malenia compared to existing methods.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the multi-scale mask-attribute alignment and the CMKI module are innovative contributions, the manuscript needs to more clearly differentiate itself from recent advancements in vision-language pre-training for medical image segmentation. There is a risk that the novelty might be overshadowed by the existing literature on similar approaches. The authors should emphasize the unique technical advancements and empirical improvements provided by Malenia over existing methods.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted on three datasets, which is commendable. However, the datasets primarily consist of specific lesion types (e.g., kidney tumors, liver cysts), and the evaluation could benefit from a broader range of lesion types and anatomical regions to validate the model's generalizability. Additionally, the inclusion of cross-modality evaluations (e.g., MRI) would strengthen the claim of the model's versatility and applicability to different imaging modalities.\n\n3. Comparisons: The comparison against existing methods is thorough, but the manuscript should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations and challenges faced by competing methods, particularly in terms of their inability to handle unseen lesion types effectively. This would help highlight the advantages of Malenia more clearly.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors mention that code will be made available, which is good. However, the manuscript should provide more explicit details regarding the training protocols, hyperparameters, and preprocessing steps. This would ensure that the results can be independently reproduced and validated by other researchers.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figure 3: The figure is somewhat cluttered. Showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions would improve readability.\n   \n2. Section 3.1: The introduction of notation in the multi-scale mask-attribute alignment section is somewhat lacking in clarity. Additional explanations of the forward operator and other key notations would be beneficial.\n   \n3. Acronyms: Some acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with the terminology.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors, such as \"k-spacce\" (page 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (page 7), should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical imaging: achieving robust zero-shot lesion segmentation across diverse lesion types. The proposed multi-scale mask-attribute alignment strategy and the CMKI module are innovative technical contributions that improve the alignment between visual and textual features, leading to superior segmentation performance. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including a broader range of lesion types and anatomical regions, as well as cross-modality assessments. The reproducibility of the approach is satisfactory, but more detailed methodological descriptions are necessary to ensure complete transparency. Overall, Malenia demonstrates promising performance and has the potential to advance the state of the art in zero-shot lesion segmentation.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, broaden the scope of the evaluation to include a wider range of lesion types and anatomical regions, and provide more detailed methodological descriptions to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Long-tailed learning is considered to be an extremely challenging problem in data imbalance learning. It aims to train well-generalized models from a large number of images that follow a long-tailed class distribution. In the medical field, many diagnostic imaging exams such as dermoscopy and chest radiography yield a long-tailed distribution of complex clinical findings. Recently, long-tailed learning in medical image analysis has garnered significant attention. However, the field currently lacks a unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark, which often leads to unfair comparisons and inconclusive results. To help the community improve the evaluation and advance, we build a unified, well-structured codebase called Medical OpeN-source Long-taIled ClassifiCAtion (MONICA), which implements over 30 methods developed in relevant fields and evaluated on 12 long-tailed medical datasets covering 6 medical domains. Our work provides valuable practical guidance and insights for the field, offering detailed analysis and discussion on the effectiveness of individual components within the inbuilt state-of-the-art methodologies. We hope this codebase serves as a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark, encouraging further advancements in long-tailed medical image learning. The codebase will be publicly available on GitHub.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a framework and codebase for structured benchmarking of long-tailed (LT) learning methods on various medical image classification tasks. The benchmark, MONICA, implements over 30 LT learning methods, with comprehensive experiments assessing performance across 12 LT medical image classification datasets spanning 6 different modalities. The experiments analyze which methods, and categories of methods, provide the most benefit to LT medical image classification across tasks in a controlled environment.\n\n### Soundness: 4\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n- This work addresses an important problem, namely the variability in dataset/hyperparameters/etc. when evaluating LT learning methods for medical image classification tasks. These variations in setting make head-to-head comparisons difficult, so MONICA serves to provide a “fair playing ground” for these LT learning methods.\n- The framework will become publicly available and should serve as an extensible resource going forward for LT medical image classification research.\n- The organization and presentation quality of the paper is strong, with helpful use of formatting (typesetting, color, etc.) and high-quality figures.\n- Experiments are very thorough, spanning many relevant methods, datasets, and tasks.\n- Discussion is thoughtful, going beyond simply displaying all benchmark results. The authors try to synthesize takeaways, provide caveats/limitations, assess out-of-distribution performance, and more.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Writing can be improved throughout. See specific comments below for examples of awkward wording, inconsistent naming, grammatical errors, etc.\n- It is possible that choosing a fixed set of hyperparameters across methods unintentionally advantages certain methods. Ideally, one could argue that each method should be individually tuned on each task; however, I am aware that this would require a vast amount of resources and time, so I do not consider this a major limitation. More practical solutions to enhance the benchmark would be the following: (i) uncertainty estimates should be provided (e.g., bootstrapped confidence intervals or standard deviations over multiple runs), and (ii) multiple performance metrics should be provided (e.g., AUROC).\n\n### Questions\n\n- Is it possible that the chosen hyperparameters used across all methods happen to be more advantageous for certain methods and suboptimal for others? In one sense, using the same set of hyperparameters across methods appears “fair”; however, it may actually be more fair to individually tune each method on each task. I recognize the difficulty of conducting fair comparisons in such a large-scale experimental setting, where it is costly to, e.g., run multiple trials of all experiments. I am not asking the authors to necessarily perform such experiments, but rather to consider this point and perhaps comment on it as a limitation/consideration.\n- Can the authors provide a summary of practical suggestions for which methods to use in a few sentences near the Conclusion?\n- I might suggest including the **rank** of each method on a given task in all tables. This would also enable you to *quantitatively* assess method performance across tasks (which method has the lowest average/median rank overall?). To make this work logistically (fit all columns in the table), you may need to reduce the precision to one decimal place, e.g.\n- The two paragraphs “LTMIC improves out-of-distribution detection” and “Using imbalanced validation dataset for checkpoint selection” are not properly set up. For the former, what does it mean to use “ImageNet as OOD samples, with 1,000 randomly selected images”? What exactly is the task, how is it formulated, and how are experiments conducted? Further, why do we care about this model behavior? For the former, Figure 4 and its findings are confusing – why exactly does this demonstrate “stable convergence”? My general advice: **Use the methods section to describe and prepare the reader to understand everything that appears in the results**. When I come to these results sections, I should already have an idea of what experiments you have performed.\n\n**Minor comments/questions:**\n- Avoid editorializing with value judgments: “benchmark is **meticulously** designed”; “we… develop a… **well-structured** codebase”; “our work provides **valuable** practical guidance”. Simply present your work and let the reader make these judgments!\n- “data imbalance learning” is not a phrase I have heard. Perhaps “imbalanced learning”?\n- “unified, strictly formulated, and comprehensive benchmark”. Unsure what “strictly formulated” means. Could simply say “unified, comprehensive benchmark”\n- “we build a… codebase…, which implements over 30 methods… and evaluated on 12… datasets”. It seems that “evaluated on” is the wrong tense; also, what is being evaluated?\n- This does not belong in an abstract: “We hope this codebase serves as a comprehensive and reproducible benchmark, encouraging further advancements in long-tailed medical image learning.”\n- Often unnecessary inclusion of “the” before concepts: “The deep learning techniques”; “the collected image datasets”; “the long-tailed imbalance”\n- “The deep learning techniques have proven effective for most computer vision tasks benefiting from the grown-up dataset scale.” Remove “The”; what does “grown-up dataset scale” mean? “Grown-up” is not the right adjective – be more concrete.\n- Refrain from claims like “always result” (line 57) – soften to “usually” or similar\n- Confused by this justification: “it is vital to recognize these rare diseases in real-world practice, as they are relatively rare for doctors and may also lack diagnostic capacity.” This reads as “it is vital to recognize rare diseases because they are rare”.\n- Line 65: can change “contributions, i.e.,” -> “contributions:”\n- Be consistent with capitalization/presentation of terms: “Re-sampling” vs “re-sampling”; “Module improvement” vs. “Module Improvement”; “mnist” vs. “MNIST”; “mixup” vs. “MixUp”; etc.\n- Line 82: “we are still curious to explore”. Perhaps just “we aim to explore”?\n- “The partition schemes are vita important”. What does “vita” mean?\n- The last two paragraphs of the introduction are probably better off being formatted as bulleted or numbered lists. Also, it is unclear why these numbered lists are formatted differently: **1) xxx.** vs. (1) xxx.\n- “of class $k$ where $\\rho$ denoted as imbalance ratio”. The phrase “denoted as” is awkward + need a comma after $k$\n- “a common assumption in long-tailed learning is when the classes are sorted by cardinality in decreasing order” I’m not sure what this means or why this represents an “assumption”. I would just remove this sentence since it does not seem to be used later.\n- Line 144: “is a long-tailed version constructed from”. Need to say it is a version “of” something; alternatively, use a word other than “version” like “dataset”\n- Inconsistent spacing/use of commas in numbers. “10, 015” -> “10,015”; “3200 fundus images” -> “3,200 fundus images”\n- Inconsistent spacing around commas and colons: “training/off-site testing / on-site testin”; “7 : 1: 2”; etc.\n- “Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark” -> “the Liver Tumor Segmentation Benchmark”\n- I realize it is hard to categorize some methods into one bin but GCL loss going in Information Augmentation is interesting, particularly since all other losses fall under re-sampling. It seems to also have module improvement as well.\n- “Causal classifier (Tang et al., 2020) resorted to causal inference for keeping the good and removing the bad momentum causal effects in long-tailed learning.” The phrase “resorted to” is strange and has a negative connotation; also, what do “good” and “bad” mean?\n- “All these designs are for the fairness and the practicality of the comparison on the benchmark.” Too vague – in what specific way do these support fairness?\n- Table 3: Inconsistent “Avg” vs “Avg.” vs “avg”\n- Table 4: Consider using a line break occasionally (so one loss function occupies two rows). This would allow you to use a larger font size. Also, be consistent “CrossEntropy” vs “CE”?\n- “assessing MixUp based solely on performance is not fair”. Soften to “may not be fair”\n- “led to a significant performance decline, e.g,”. Refrain from saying “significant” without statistical significance test + change “e.g,” -> “e.g.,”\n- “Use two-stage training as a general paradigm” sounds like a command. Perhaps “Using”?\n- Define “SSL” acronym at first use\n- “Modify classifier to reduce prediction bias” -> “Classifier modification to reduce prediction bias”\n- “In Fig. 2, We visualize” -> “In Fig. 2, we visualize”\n- Table 5 indicates the meaning of asterisk, which is never used in the table.\n- “models with larger parameters”. The parameters are not “larger” – could say “more parameters” or “a larger parameter count” perhaps.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 8\n\n### Confidence: 4",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a unified benchmark for long-tailed learning in the medical domain by integrating several existing datasets and implementing a complete pipeline from data loading to model training and evaluation. The authors claim that the benchmark supports over 30 methods for comparison and provides an analysis of their performances.\n\n- Update after the discussion phase:\n\nThank you for the detailed responses! I've raised my score. While my concerns are not entirely resolved, I believe with careful revisions, its future version has the potential to be accepted.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper attempts to provide a comprehensive benchmark for long-tailed medical image classification. The idea of integrating multiple existing methods and datasets into a unified platform could potentially be useful for researchers who want to compare various methodologies under a standardized framework.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. Motivation. The paper lacks sufficient justification for evaluating long-tailed problems specifically in medical imaging tasks. While the authors mention some motivations at the beginning, these arguments are not convincing. Is there a fundamental difference between long-tailed problems in medical imaging and those in conventional tasks? Would this difference necessitate different methodologies? Even if the data modalities and evaluation methods are distinct (e.g., balanced vs. imbalanced test sets), would this lead to fundamentally different approaches? The paper analyzes multiple methods based on this premise but fails to provide insightful conclusions, which further deepens my skepticism about the motivation.\n\n2. Dataset Contribution. Although the paper claims to use 12 datasets, 7 of these come from MedMNIST, and several of them are derived from previous work. This reduces the originality of the dataset contribution. Furthermore, the split between multi-class and multi-label datasets is 9/3, respectively. It is worth noting that many existing studies have already utilized MedMNIST for long-tailed learning (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=11226954386823169312&scipsc=1&q=long+tail). Given that 7 out of the 12 datasets in this paper are from MedMNIST, why should users choose MONICA over MedMNIST, which already has extensive use and coverage in the medical imaging field? Additionally, the experimental methods used for multi-class and multi-label datasets are almost entirely different, and the analysis of multi-label results is limited to a single vague statement that multi-label classification is more challenging. This gives the impression that multi-label datasets were included just for the sake of completeness, rather than being a key focus.\n\n3. Code Contribution. The code is not provided in the appendix, nor is there an anonymous GitHub link, which means the authors' claims about the code cannot be verified. By comparison, the NeurIPS D&B track (single-blind review) usually includes dataset or code links, along with information about author affiliations, licenses, and ethics. Although such links may be added after acceptance, this suggests that such work may not be well-suited for ICLR's double-blind review process.\n\n    Additionally, the description of the code structure in Section 3.1 is not particularly informative. The modular design described is basic and lacks novel insights. A more impactful modular design, like in mmdetection, which breaks down components into backbone, neck, and bbox head, would have been more meaningful. As it stands, the description feels unnecessary.\n\n4. Experimental Analysis Lacks of Insights. Comments below:\n\n    - Despite using multiple datasets, the authors only provide a generic / systematic comparison of the methods without analyzing differences across domains. For example, there is no discussion about which methods are better suited for dermatology versus ophthalmology. Almost all discussion is very general, without any specific insights related to medical applications. This diminishes the value of using 12 datasets, as the conclusions drawn are not substantially different from what could be obtained from a single dataset.\n\n    - The analysis in Section 4.2 is poorly organized. There is no clear structure, with the discussion jumping from evaluation metrics (e.g., \"Curse of shot-based group evaluation\") to re-sampling methods, MixUp, two-stage training, and even self-supervised learning in a seemingly random fashion. Many claims are also not supported by data. The overall takeaway from the experimental section is unclear, and I did not gain any insights on how to design better models.\n\n    - In Section 4.1, there is inconsistency in the training strategies used: some methods use a unified training strategy, while others use the one specified in the original paper (e.g., SAM, Line 306), with no explanation for this discrepancy.\n\n    - There are issues with the tables, such as Table 2, where it is unclear what methods like ERM, cRT, and LWS represent, as they are not referenced properly. Additionally, Section 3.2.3 does not fully align with the table.\n\n    - The categorization of methods is confusing. The authors categorize methods into three types—class re-sampling, information augmentation, and module improvement—but later mention that re-sampling and MixUp are used in many methods, making the classification in Tables 2/3 somewhat meaningless.\n\n    - The discussion on self-supervised learning (Line 398) appears out of place, as it is not introduced earlier.\n\n    - Similarly, the mention of OOD detection (Line 421) is abrupt and lacks context.\n\n    - The section on using an imbalanced validation dataset for checkpoint selection is unclear about its purpose. The conclusion seems to be that GCL exhibits lower fluctuations, but the reasoning and implications are not well explained. Additionally, Figure 4 lacks labels for the x and y axes, making interpretation difficult.\n\n    - Line 475 suddenly states that multi-label classification is more challenging without providing adequate context or analysis.\n\n    - Line 504 claims that \"the most advanced long-tailed learning methods no longer focus on improving a single strategy,\" but this claim is not well-supported by the preceding analysis.\n\n### Questions\n\nSee weakness sections. Some more questions below:\n\nCould you elaborate on why the results of self-supervised learning and OOD detection are relevant in this paper? They seem out of place given the main focus on long-tailed classification.\n\nWhy did the authors not include a domain-specific analysis (e.g., which methods work better for certain medical fields)? It seems like an important missed opportunity.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The uneven experimental methods between multi-class and multi-label datasets are concerning, compounded by a lack of depth in the analysis of multi-label results.\n\n3. **Code Contribution:** There is no code provided for verification, nor is there a link to an anonymous GitHub repository. The description of the code structure appears basic, lacking innovative details. This absence of practical accessibility contradicts expectations for transparency in this research community.\n\n4. **Experimental Analysis:** The analysis reveals several critical shortcomings:\n   - A lack of domain-specific insights, as no discussions delineate method performance distinctions in different medical fields.\n   - Poor organization in Section 4.2, making it challenging to grasp the analysis’s aim and conclusions.\n   - Inconsistent training strategies being employed without justification.\n   - Tables lack adequate context and clarity regarding methodologies.\n   - Sudden assertions regarding multi-label challenges and self-supervised learning seem irrelevant and poorly integrated into the overall narrative.\n\n**Minor Comments:**\n- The acronym definitions should be clarified upon first use.\n- Figures necessitate axis labels for better comprehension.\n- Several claims are presented without sufficient empirical support.\n\n**Summary Paragraph:**\nIn evaluating the manuscript against the four TMI editorial criteria, its significance is recognized through the attempt to standardize long-tailed learning evaluation in medical imaging, yet its innovation is hindered by the reliance on previously established datasets. Evaluation methods lack rigor and depth, especially in addressing domain-specific nuances, which undermines the paper's reproducibility potential. While the paper has strengths in proposing a benchmarking framework, it falls short in delivering comprehensive insights and justifications for its approaches.\n\n**Decision Recommendation:**\nMajor revision.",

The paper does not convincingly demonstrate how long-tailed learning in medical tasks fundamentally differs from conventional domains or warrants specialized methodologies. The analyses performed do not yield domain-specific insights, reducing the perceived relevance of the medical focus.  \n\n2. **Dataset Contribution:** The dataset composition limits originality. Of the twelve datasets, seven derive from MedMNIST, and the rationale for creating a new benchmark instead of using existing ones is not well articulated. The imbalance between multi-class and multi-label datasets (9/3) is noted, and the handling of multi-label data appears superficial, giving the impression of inclusion for completeness rather than substantive study.  \n\n3. **Code Availability and Design:** Absence of code or repository link undermines reproducibility. The textual description of the code structure is generic and lacks meaningful modular innovations. Compared to other frameworks, the design appears simplistic and of limited technical contribution.  \n\n4. **Experimental Analysis and Interpretation:** The evaluation lacks depth and organization. Cross-domain insights (e.g., dermatology vs. ophthalmology) are missing. Section 4.2 mixes topics such as metrics, re-sampling, and MixUp without clear logical flow. Key tables and figures lack clarity, and several claims are presented without empirical support. Method categorization is inconsistent, and sections on self-supervised learning, OOD detection, and imbalanced validation appear disconnected or unexplained.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify notations for methods such as ERM, cRT, and LWS in tables.  \n- Ensure alignment between text descriptions (Section 3.2.3) and tables.  \n- Improve labeling in Figure 4 (axes missing).  \n- Maintain consistent training strategies across compared methods.  \n- Several abrupt statements (e.g., on multi-label difficulty, advanced methods) should be substantiated.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph (TMI Criteria)**  \n**Significance:** The paper addresses an important problem—benchmarking long-tailed learning in medical imaging—but its added value over existing efforts remains uncertain.  \n**Innovation:** The integration of multiple datasets is practical but insufficiently novel.

        "text": "**Phase 1. Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript, *MONICA: Benchmarking on Long-Tailed Medical Image Classification*, develops and releases a large-scale benchmark and modular codebase for evaluating long-tailed learning (LTL) algorithms within medical imaging classification tasks. While the work does not introduce a novel algorithm or theoretical contribution in imaging methodology per se, it addresses a significant methodological gap — the lack of standardized, reproducible evaluation and fair comparison across long-tailed medical imaging datasets. Given that IEEE TMI occasionally publishes benchmark or methodological synthesis papers that materially advance the reproducibility and methodological understanding of imaging AI systems, the scope can be considered **conditionally relevant**. However, the contribution is more infrastructural and empirical than fundamentally methodological.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \n⚠️ The core novelty resides in curating and unifying 12 medical datasets, incorporating 30+ long-tailed methods into a coherent codebase, and empirically analyzing their cross-domain generalization. These are useful engineering and benchmarking contributions, but the methodological novelty is low—no new loss function or model architecture is proposed. The paper’s unique contribution is thus its comprehensiveness, reproducibility, and analysis rather than scientific innovation. This positions the work **below the typical TMI novelty threshold**, although it has practical value.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe paper demonstrates strong experimental organization: unified training pipelines, cross-validation protocols, extensive comparisons, and consistent baselines. Tables 2–5 are detailed, and implementation transparency is high (code release promised). However:  \n- Statistical significance or uncertainty analysis (e.g., standard deviations, CIs) is missing.  \n- Many experimental decisions (hyperparameters, group thresholds) appear heuristic.  \n- Multi-label evaluation could be more rigorous; e.g., exact mean average precision values and per-class calibration are not included.  \n- No theoretical analysis or in-depth model interpretability assessment.  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nOverall clear and readable. The manuscript is lengthy but well structured; tables and figures are legible. Minor grammar and phrasing inconsistencies appear (“vita important,” “we will shortly introduce” etc.). Figures could use higher resolution or graphical consistency (e.g., Fig. 3–4 fonts).  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nThe datasets referenced are all public (e.g., ISIC, CheXpert, MedMNIST). There is no human data collection in this work. Ethical compliance and anonymization are hence adequate. Reproducibility is strong, with clear modular design and promised GitHub release.  \n\n---\n\n**Phase 2. IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThis paper presents **MONICA**, a comprehensive open-source benchmark for **long-tailed medical image classification (LTMIC)**. It integrates 12 publicly available datasets across 6 medical domains (dermatology, ophthalmology, radiology, pathology, hematology, histology, gastroenterology) and over 30 long-tailed learning algorithms grouped into resampling, data augmentation, and module-modification methods. The authors evaluate these under uniform training conditions (mainly ResNet‑50 backbone, Adam optimizer) and provide detailed cross-dataset comparisons, highlighting empirical insights into what factors drive performance differences across imbalance levels and dataset modalities.\n\n**2. Strengths**  \n- First unified and reproducible benchmark addressing long-tailed imbalance for medical imaging.  \n- Integrates diverse datasets and 30+ SOTA LTL algorithms, providing immediate utility to the community.  \n- Transparent and modular codebase structure; practical resource for fair comparison.  \n- Methodological findings (e.g., interplay between resampling and classifier normalization, importance of two-stage training) offer empirical guidance.  \n- Strong reproducibility plan and detailed documentation.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**  \n- Limited methodological novelty: mostly repackages and systematizes existing methods.  \n- Statistical rigor is limited — no confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, or extensive ablation studies.  \n- Evaluation metrics focus on accuracy/mAP; lacks calibration, uncertainty, or clinical interpretation analysis relevant to medical imaging applications.  \n- Multi-label LTMIC discussion is brief and not deeply explored.  \n- Conclusions are largely descriptive without deeper methodological insight or theoretical generalization.\n\n**4. Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological Novelty & Positioning** – Clarify the positioning of MONICA: Is it proposed as a *benchmark paper* or an *algorithmic contribution*? For TMI readership, emphasize its utility for methodological validation and reproducibility, rather than as a new method. Consider reframing contributions accordingly.  \n2. **Statistical and Uncertainty Analysis** – Report variance over multiple training runs and statistical comparisons between methods. Include significance testing or confidence intervals for at least a subset of key results (Table 2–3).  \n3. **Evaluation Metrics** – Expand to include calibration metrics (e.g., ECE, Brier score) to align better with TMI’s focus on clinically reliable AI.  \n4. **Multi-label Classification Section** – Deepen this section: describe evaluation metrics (exact mAP computation), address label co-occurrence quantitatively, and elaborate on class-wise distributions.  \n5. **Clinical Interpretation & Relevance** – Discuss how the benchmark insights might influence clinical deployment or development of medically robust algorithms (e.g., rare disease detection, regulatory validation).  \n6. **Benchmark Maintenance** – Describe future update strategy (versioning, dataset expansion) for reproducibility and long-term community usage.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**  \n- Minor wording issues: correct typographical errors (“vita important,” “Re-search” → “Research”).  \n- Standardize the capitalization and naming of methods and datasets.  \n- Some tables (e.g., Table 2–3) are dense—consider highlighting top-performing methods in each category.  \n- Include GitHub link upon release for verification.  \n- Clarify figures (axes labels in Fig. 2–4 somewhat small).  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n⚠️ **Reject (Out of Scope / Low Novelty)**  \nWhile technically solid and valuable as a benchmarking resource, the work predominantly provides an organizational framework and comparative analysis rather than a new methodological advancement in imaging science. IEEE TMI prioritizes methodological innovation or theoretical insight; this paper would be more suited to journals emphasizing open resources and applied benchmarking (e.g., *Medical Image Analysis – Datasets and Benchmarks track* or *Scientific Data*).  \nIf the authors can include novel evaluation methodology (e.g., new metric for imbalance calibration, theoretical rationale for algorithm behaviors) or deeper analysis of medical imaging–specific LTL phenomena, re-submission to TMI could be reconsidered.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nValuable benchmarking contribution with strong engineering and reproducibility merit but insufficient methodological innovation for IEEE TMI’s core scope. Recommend redirection to a benchmark- or data-oriented venue, or substantial reframing to include analytic or theoretical advancement suitable for TMI.",

The authors implement over 30 state-of-the-art long-tailed learning methodologies across 12 medical datasets spanning 6 medical domains (dermatology, ophthalmology, radiology, pathology, hematology, histology, gastroenterology). The benchmark addresses the lack of unified evaluation frameworks in long-tailed medical image learning by providing a modular codebase with standardized experimental protocols. Key findings include: (1) methods combining re-sampling, information augmentation, and module improvements (like GCL) achieve superior performance, (2) two-stage training paradigms offer significant flexibility, (3) simple re-sampling strategies remain effective baselines, and (4) multi-label classification presents additional complexities compared to multi-class tasks. The work aims to establish fair comparison standards and provide practical guidance for researchers developing long-tailed medical image classification systems.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Insufficient mathematical formulation clarity and consistency**\n  - The problem definition in Section 2.1 (lines 108-119) uses inconsistent notation, where π represents both a vector and individual frequencies, creating ambiguity in mathematical interpretation\n  - The imbalance ratio definition ρ = n1/nk lacks clear specification of which classes n1 and nk represent, particularly given the ordering assumption\n  - Multi-label formulation introduces LCard metric (line 118) without proper mathematical context or connection to the main problem formulation\n\n• **Limited experimental rigor and statistical validation**\n  - No statistical significance testing is reported across the extensive results in Tables 2, 3, and 5, making it impossible to distinguish meaningful performance differences from noise\n  - Single-run experiments without confidence intervals or multiple trials weaken the reliability of comparative conclusions, particularly given the modest performance differences observed\n  - Hyperparameter selection methodology is not systematically described (Section 4.1, lines 281-288), potentially introducing bias in method comparisons\n\n• **Inadequate baseline establishment and evaluation protocol**\n  - The choice of ResNet-50 as the unified backbone (line 284) is not justified against other architectures, limiting generalizability of conclusions\n  - Missing ablation studies to isolate the contribution of individual components within complex methods like GCL, making it difficult to understand which aspects drive performance improvements\n  - Validation set construction methodology varies inconsistently across datasets (Table 1), compromising the fairness of cross-dataset comparisons\n\n• **Incomplete coverage of relevant methodologies and recent advances**\n  - Several important recent long-tailed learning methods are mentioned as implemented but excluded from results presentation without clear justification criteria\n  - Self-supervised learning exploration (lines 407-420) is dismissed too readily based on limited experimentation, despite its potential relevance to medical imaging\n  - Multi-label long-tailed learning receives insufficient treatment given its clinical importance, with methods evaluation limited to basic adaptations\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical precision and notation consistency**\n  - Revise Section 2.1 to use distinct notation for the frequency vector π and individual class frequencies πk, providing clear mathematical definitions for all symbols\n  - Explicitly define the class ordering convention and specify that ρ represents the ratio between most frequent and least frequent classes\n  - Provide rigorous mathematical formulation for multi-label metrics and their relationship to the core long-tailed learning problem\n\n• **Strengthen experimental methodology with statistical validation**\n  - Conduct multiple independent runs for all experiments and report mean performance with confidence intervals or standard deviations\n  - Apply appropriate statistical significance tests (e.g., paired t-tests) to validate performance differences between methods\n  - Establish systematic hyperparameter selection protocols using validation sets and document the optimization process for reproducibility\n\n• **Develop comprehensive baseline evaluation framework**\n  - Justify the backbone architecture choice through systematic comparison with alternatives (e.g., Vision Transformers, EfficientNets) on representative datasets\n  - Include detailed ablation studies for complex methods to isolate the contribution of individual components\n  - Standardize validation set construction methodology across all datasets to ensure fair comparison protocols\n\n• **Expand methodological coverage and analysis depth**\n  - Include results for all implemented methods with clear criteria for inclusion/exclusion in the main results presentation\n  - Conduct more systematic exploration of self-supervised learning with proper hyperparameter tuning and augmentation strategies tailored to medical imaging\n  - Develop specialized evaluation protocols and metrics for multi-label long-tailed learning that account for label co-occurrence patterns and clinical relevance",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces MONICA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-tailed medical image classification (LTMIC) methodologies across 12 diverse datasets spanning six medical domains. The authors implement over 30 long-tailed learning methods, including re-sampling, information augmentation, and module improvement techniques. The paper discusses the evaluation results, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of various methods and offering practical insights for future research. The manuscript is well-written and provides a valuable resource for researchers working in LTMIC.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: \n   - While MONICA is a valuable contribution to the field, it is important to clarify how it distinguishes itself from existing benchmarks like CIFAR-100-LT and ImageNet-LT. The authors should provide a clearer comparison and position MONICA within the landscape of existing long-tailed learning benchmarks.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design:\n   - The evaluation covers a broad range of datasets and methods, but the inclusion of only a subset of state-of-the-art methods might limit the scope of the comparison. The authors should consider expanding the list of methods to include recent advancements in long-tailed learning, particularly those that have shown significant improvements in natural image classification.\n   \n3. Generalizability:\n   - The paper emphasizes the importance of generalizing long-tailed learning methods across different medical domains. However, the datasets used are relatively small and may not fully capture the variability found in real-world medical imaging scenarios. The authors should discuss potential limitations and future directions for scaling up the benchmark to include larger, more diverse datasets.\n   \n4. Reproducibility:\n   - The authors mention that the code will be publicly available, but the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters used for each method. Providing a more comprehensive documentation of these aspects would greatly enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Some figures, such as Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, are somewhat cluttered and could benefit from a clearer layout with fewer representative slices or zoomed-in regions to improve readability.\n2. Notation Consistency: The notation used in Section 2.1 for the forward operator is inconsistent and should be clarified.\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without being defined, which can confuse readers who are not familiar with the terminology.\n4. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical errors exist throughout the text, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7).\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge in medical image classification: dealing with long-tailed class distributions. The introduction of MONICA as a comprehensive benchmark is innovative and provides a valuable resource for researchers. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including a broader range of state-of-the-art methods and larger, more diverse datasets. The reproducibility of the results is a concern due to the lack of detailed methodological descriptions. Overall, while the manuscript has significant potential, it requires further refinement to fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include a wider range of state-of-the-art methods, provide a more comprehensive description of the training protocols and preprocessing steps, and address the minor comments to improve the clarity and reproducibility of the work.",

The key issues it aims to solve include:\n\n1.\tPatient Variability: There is considerable variability among different patients, which complicates the segmentation of tumors and critical organs in medical images.\n2.\tLimited Annotated Data: Many existing segmentation algorithms rely on large amounts of annotated training data. However, personalized treatment often encounters a shortage of such data for individual patients, making it difficult to train models effectively.\n\nTo overcome these obstacles, the authors propose a new approach formulated as an in-context segmentation problem, leveraging the promptable segmentation mechanism of the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Their method, named P2SAM (Part-aware Personalized Segment Anything Model), allows for seamless adaptation to new, out-of-distribution patients using only one-shot patient-specific data.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The manuscript is clearly expressed and presents the research in a logical and structured manner, although some sentences are lengthy and could benefit from simplification to enhance readability.\n2. The paper presents substantial qualitative results and includes experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating a considerable amount of work.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. Representation: The overall logic of the paper appears problematic to me. The title and introduction emphasize \"Precision Medicine,\" yet the writing primarily focuses on highlighting the general applicability of the proposed method. Numerous examples and results are presented from the natural image domain, while the content related to \"Precision Medicine\" is notably limited, which may cause confusion for readers.\n\n2. The motivation for the \"Part-aware Prompt Mechanism\" is unclear: what is the reasoning behind this approach, and how does it address challenges in medical tasks? The architecture diagram is also based on natural image applications, leaving it unclear how the proposed method tackles issues specific to precision medicine. Additionally, there is no discussion on how this approach handles different modalities in medical imaging, which the paper should address.\n\n3. Method: Several aspects require further clarification and enhancement. \n\n     a. Firstly, the decision to use only a single negative point per cluster raises concerns regarding its sufficiency. A more robust approach would involve utilizing multiple negative points to enhance model generalization.\n\n     b. Secondly, while the method is designed for patient-specific segmentation, it raises concerns about its application to multi-segmentation tasks. A discussion on how the part-aware prompt mechanism could adapt to scenarios involving multiple segmentations would improve the methodology's applicability.\n\n     c. Additionally, the manuscript relies on 2D segmentation, which requires numerous points for effective performance. This issue remains unaddressed, and the choice not to utilize native 3D models is not sufficiently justified. Given the advantages of 3D models in capturing spatial relationships and providing more comprehensive context in medical imaging, exploring their potential application in this study would strengthen the methodology.\n\n4. Experiments: Several areas require clarification and enhancement.\n\n     a. Firstly, it is unclear whether the number of clusters set for K-means is consistent across different datasets. A detailed explanation of how the clustering parameters are determined for each dataset would improve the robustness of the results and ensure comparability.\n\n     b. Secondly, the comparison methods lack the inclusion of the latest medical-related benchmarks. Integrating more recent studies or state-of-the-art approaches would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's performance. This would help contextualize the results within the current landscape of medical imaging segmentation research.\n\n5. The paper lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Numerous improvements to SAM tailored for medical imaging have been proposed, yet many of them are omitted in this work’s comparative experiments. Furthermore, several segmentation baselines widely used in the medical domain are not referenced, which casts doubt on the demonstrated effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Is the proposed method truly aimed at addressing \"Precision Medicine,\" as suggested in the title and introduction, or is it intended as a more general approach applicable to both natural image and medical imaging domains? These are fundamentally different focuses, and clarity on this point is essential.\n\n2. What is the motivation behind the proposed method, and how does it address some of the fundamental challenges in the medical imaging field, such as unclear lesion boundaries and significant variations across different imaging modalities? Clarity on how these issues are tackled is crucial.\n\n3. Since the method claims to address patient-specific segmentation, it must consider the significant variability in characteristics across different diseases, such as liver cancer, pancreatic cancer, and rectal cancer. How does the proposed method ensure effectiveness when dealing with patients suffering from various diseases with distinct features?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 1\n\n### Confidence: 5",

The authors also propose a similarity-based refinement to control the number of prompts found during step 1. Main experiments were conducted on the NSCLC and CVC-ClinicDB datasets where the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performances. Further experiments were conducted to show the method's performance against tracking algorithms and on the one-shot segmentation task.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.

It overlaps with Table 1 and 2 and brings little additional information. (b) For the baseline methods: direct-transfer and fine-tune, looks like no prompts are provided during the evaluation stage. Can the authors verify this is true?\n2. The contribution on the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism is unclear. Although the authors have demonstrated the effectiveness of the overall method, it is unclear if the improvements are from the part-based sampling strategy or merely because of having multiple prompts.\n3. (Minor) The application range of the method is limited to patients with multi-exams.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism, could the author compared to a modified version of PerSAM where instead of selecting \"two points with the highest and lowest confidence values\", the authors may select the top K and bot K' points where K and K' matches P^2SAM. In this way, the authors can demonstrate that points found by the Part-aware Prompt Mechanism are more effective. \n2. Since authors have shown better one-shot segmentation performance, I am curious to see if the authors can show their method's performance beyond patients with multi-exams. For example, for some medical segmentation datasets without patients with multi-exams, can the author randomly select one image-mask pair as the prior and test the model's performance on other pairs.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The work introduces a new prompt‑based mechanism and a distribution‑similarity retrieval procedure compatible with general promptable models (SAM, SAM 2). It squarely targets methodological innovation in image segmentation, not an application‑only study. Thus, the paper fits TMI’s methodological scope.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level – Medium‑High**  \nInnovation lies in formalizing *patient‑specific segmentation as an in‑context segmentation problem* and augmenting SAM with multi‑point, *part‑aware* prompts plus a *distribution‑similarity retrieval* criterion to select the number of parts automatically. These ideas extend prior PerSAM and Matcher works by introducing (i) a feature‑driven prompt generation process and (ii) a principled adaptation heuristic. While this builds on existing SAM foundations, it provides recognizable novelty and conceptual contribution at the method level — likely within TMI’s novelty threshold.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor – Moderate to Good**  \nExperiments cover multiple medical domains (CT lung, endoscopy) and compare P²SAM against strong baselines on both *in‑distribution* and *out‑of‑distribution* datasets, with ablation and cross‑domain extension to natural images. Implementation details, hyperparameters, and retrieval settings are extensive (Appendices B–C).  \nHowever:  \n- Reproducibility of one‑shot “prior” data setup could benefit from explicit configuration scripts or public code.  \n- Uncertainty analysis and statistical significance testing are absent.  \n- Although IRB aspects are likely met via public datasets, explicit ethical statements should be added.\n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation – Good but dense**  \nThe manuscript is technically detailed and readable for an imaging‑methodology audience. Nonetheless, figure readability (visual scale/labels), equation typesetting, and excess references lead to occasional clutter. Editorial tightening would aid flow.  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance – Partially addressed**  \nAuthors use public datasets (TCIA, Kvasir, CVC), promising code release on acceptance. Explicit mention of IRB exemption and patient anonymization should appear in the Methods.\n\n---\n\n## **Phase 2 : IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n### **1. Summary**\nThe paper presents *P²SAM*, a **training‑free, patient‑specific segmentation framework** leveraging the Segment‑Anything model’s promptable structure. Instead of fine‑tuning, P²SAM clusters reference‑image features into part‑level embeddings that guide multi‑point positive/negative prompts for a new patient image. A *distribution‑similarity retrieval* (using Wasserstein distance) then determines the optimal number of parts. Demonstrations on CT lung tumor and endoscopy polyp segmentation show performance gains of ≈ 8 % Dice over comparable methods, with cross‑domain validation on natural‑image few‑shot benchmarks.\n\n### **2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological innovation in prompt selection and adaptive part‑count retrieval.  \n- Sound integration with foundation models (SAM/SAM 2) without retraining.  \n- Comprehensive experiments, including ablations and extension to multiple domains.  \n- Addresses a clinically relevant scenario — *patient‑specific (one‑shot) segmentation* — under the precision‑medicine paradigm.  \n\n### **3. Weaknesses**\n- Improvements over PerSAM after domain adaptation are modest; novelty may appear incremental relative to other prompt‑selection strategies.  \n- Statistical validation of performance differences is missing.  \n- Ethical and data‑use compliance needs explicit statement.  \n- Paper length and figure density affect readability; discussion could better isolate clinical significance.  \n- Some domain‑adaptation steps are tangential and could be streamlined.  \n\n### **4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify novelty relative to Matcher and PerSAM.** Provide algorithmic and conceptual comparisons (e.g., computational cost, robustness) in a dedicated subsection.  \n2. **Statistical significance and uncertainty.** Report variance or confidence intervals for Dice/mIoU; possibly perform Wilcoxon or paired t‑tests on patient‑wise folds.  \n3. **Reproducibility.** Supply pseudocode for the retrieval process, specify seed control, and release a minimal code snapshot.  \n4. **Ethics statement.** Explicitly confirm datasets are public/anonymized and no new patient data or identifiable information were used.  \n5. **Discussion depth.** Expand on clinical feasibility—e.g., execution time per case and how one‑shot prior images would be collected in clinical pipelines.  \n\n### **5. Minor Comments**\n- Improve figure legends and resize multi‑panel figures for readability.  \n- Fix minor typographic errors (spacing, subscripts).  \n- Cite recent TMI works on adaptive or federated segmentation to situate within field.  \n- Reorder Appendix sections: AMI summary first, less critical visualizations last.  \n- Include a short limitations paragraph in the main text, not only the Appendix.  \n\n### **6. Overall Recommendation**\n**Major Revision** — The paper presents a valuable methodological contribution suitable for TMI, yet requires clearer articulation of novelty, stronger statistical evidence, and tighter presentation before acceptance. With these revisions, it could reach publishable quality.\n\n### **7. Confidence Level **\n**4 / 5 – High confidence.** I am familiar with SAM‑based segmentation and medical imaging adaptation.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper proposes P2SAM (Part-aware Personalized Segment Anything Model), a data-efficient segmentation method for patient-specific applications. The method addresses the challenge of adapting segmentation models to new patients using only one-shot prior data without model fine-tuning (Section 1). P2SAM introduces a part-aware prompt mechanism that clusters foreground features from reference images into multiple parts using k-means++ clustering (Equation 1, Section 3.2), then selects multiple-point prompts based on cosine similarity between part-level features and target image features (Equation 2). A distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach using Wasserstein distance determines the optimal number of parts for each case (Section 3.2, Figure 5). The method can be integrated into various promptable segmentation models like SAM and SAM 2. Experiments on two patient-specific segmentation tasks show improvements of +8.0% and +2.0% mean Dice score, with additional validation on natural image benchmarks achieving 95.7% mIoU on PerSeg (Tables 1-2, Table 4).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation lacks precision and clarity**\n  - Equation 1 uses the symbol \"◦\" for mask selection without formal definition, making the operation ambiguous for readers unfamiliar with this notation\n  - The clustering procedure in Section 3.2 mentions k-means++ but doesn't specify how the number of clusters n relates to the retrieval range, creating inconsistency between methodology and implementation\n  - The Wasserstein distance computation for distribution similarity (Section 3.2, Table 7) lacks mathematical formulation, making it difficult to reproduce the approach\n\n• **Experimental design contains methodological inconsistencies**\n  - Table 1 shows the \"Meta huge\" model achieves only 28.52% Dice score while fine-tuned versions reach 60%+, but no analysis explains this dramatic performance gap or validates the fairness of comparison\n  - The retrieval ranges in Tables 9-10 vary significantly across datasets and models without principled justification, suggesting ad-hoc hyperparameter tuning rather than systematic methodology\n  - Comparison with MedSAM in Table 3 uses human-provided box prompts during inference while P2SAM uses only first-visit ground truth, creating an unfair evaluation setup that undermines the claimed advantages\n\n• **Limited technical novelty and insufficient baseline coverage**\n  - The core contribution of using multiple prompts instead of single prompts is incremental, as acknowledged in Section 2 where SAM's original paper states \"ambiguity is much rarer with multiple prompts\"\n  - Missing comparisons with recent medical segmentation methods beyond MedSAM, particularly other SAM-based medical approaches mentioned in Section F but not evaluated\n  - The k-means++ clustering for part-level features (Section 3.2) is a standard technique without novel adaptation for medical imaging characteristics, limiting the technical contribution\n\n• **Evaluation methodology shows significant limitations**\n  - The patient-specific segmentation tasks only include 13 patients with multiple visits from 4D-Lung dataset (Section 4.1), which is insufficient for robust statistical validation of the claimed improvements\n  - Qualitative results in Figures 6-9 show cherry-picked examples without systematic analysis of failure cases or statistical significance testing of the quantitative improvements\n  - Cross-domain generalization claims are undermined by the large performance variations across datasets (Tables 1-2) without adequate analysis of when and why the method succeeds or fails\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and reproducibility**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definition for the mask selection operator \"◦\" in Equation 1 and specify the exact clustering algorithm parameters\n  - Add complete mathematical formulation for the Wasserstein distance computation used in the retrieval approach, including implementation details\n  - Establish principled criteria for determining retrieval ranges instead of the current ad-hoc approach shown in Tables 9-10\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation and fairness**\n  - Conduct systematic analysis explaining the performance gap between Meta and fine-tuned models, including statistical significance tests for all reported improvements\n  - Implement standardized comparison protocols ensuring all methods use equivalent information during inference, particularly for the MedSAM comparison\n  - Establish unified hyperparameter selection methodology across all datasets and provide sensitivity analysis for key parameters like the number of parts n\n\n• **Expand technical contributions and baseline coverage**\n  - Develop novel clustering or feature selection techniques specifically adapted for medical imaging characteristics rather than relying solely on standard k-means++\n  - Include comprehensive comparisons with recent SAM-based medical segmentation methods mentioned in the related work but omitted from experiments\n  - Provide deeper analysis of the relationship between prompt selection strategies and segmentation performance to establish clearer technical insights beyond the incremental multiple-prompt approach\n\n• **Improve evaluation comprehensiveness and statistical rigor**\n  - Expand the patient cohort for validation beyond the current 13 patients, and include power analysis to determine adequate sample sizes for statistical validation\n  - Implement systematic failure case analysis and provide statistical significance testing for all quantitative comparisons rather than relying primarily on qualitative examples\n  - Develop comprehensive analysis framework explaining performance variations across different medical imaging modalities and domains to better understand method limitations and applicability",

P2SAM leverages one-shot patient-specific data and integrates a part-aware prompt mechanism and a distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach to select multiple-point prompts, enhancing the generalization capabilities of the segmentation model. The method is evaluated on two patient-specific segmentation tasks—NSCLC segmentation and polyp segmentation—and demonstrates significant improvements over existing methods. The manuscript is well-written, with clear motivations and detailed methodologies, although some aspects require further clarification and expansion.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While P2SAM introduces a promising part-aware prompt mechanism, the manuscript could benefit from a more thorough discussion of how this mechanism distinguishes itself from existing works such as Matcher and PerSAM. The novelty should be more explicitly highlighted, particularly regarding the part-aware prompt mechanism and the retrieval approach.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is mainly performed on two datasets, which limits the generalizability of the results. Including more diverse datasets or anatomies would strengthen the claim of P2SAM's robustness and versatility. Additionally, the manuscript should include more comprehensive comparisons with recent works, such as MedSAM and other SAM adaptations, to better contextualize the performance improvements.\n\n3. Comparisons and Baselines: The manuscript compares P2SAM with several baselines, including Matcher and PerSAM, but it lacks a detailed comparison with MedSAM, which is a strong baseline in the medical image segmentation domain. Incorporating MedSAM would provide a more rigorous benchmark and help substantiate the claimed improvements.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript states that code will be released upon acceptance, but it is essential to provide more details about the implementation, such as hyperparameters, training protocols, and preprocessing steps. This information is crucial for reproducibility and further development of the method.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 3, 6, and 7 are somewhat cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions to enhance readability.\n   \n2. Notation: The introduction of notation in Section 2.1 lacks sufficient explanation, particularly regarding the forward operator, which is denoted inconsistently.\n   \n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7) need correction.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical image segmentation—personalizing segmentation for out-of-distribution patients with limited annotated data. The proposed P2SAM method introduces a part-aware prompt mechanism and a distribution-similarity-based retrieval approach, which contribute to its technical innovation. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited to two specific tasks, and broader validation is necessary to fully support the generalizability claims. The manuscript also requires more detailed comparisons with strong baselines like MedSAM. While the reproducibility of the approach is promised, the methodological details need to be more thoroughly documented to ensure independent reproduction. Overall, P2SAM holds promise, but the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand comparative analysis, strengthen validation across datasets and anatomies, provide more detailed methodological details for reproducibility, and include comprehensive comparisons with strong baselines such as MedSAM.",

    "abstract": "Single Domain Generalization (SDG) addresses the challenge of training a model on a single domain to ensure it generalizes well to unseen target domains. Although extensively studied in image classification, there is a lack of prior work on SDG for rare event or image classification in imbalanced dataset. In the medical diagnosis and disease detection domain, where data is often limited and events of interest are rare, deep learning (DL) models frequently exhibit suboptimal performance, leading to poor generalization across datasets. In multi-center studies, disparate data sources, differences in scanners and imaging protocols introduce domain shifts that exacerbate variability in rare event characteristics. This paper addresses this challenge by first leveraging a pre-trained large vision model to rank classes based on their similarity to the rare event class, allowing focused handling of the most similar class, and then integrates domain-invariant knowledge on rare event with DL to accurately classify the rare event class. By carefully incorporating expert knowledge with data-driven DL, our technique effectively regularizes the model, enhancing robustness and performance even with limited data availability. We present a case study on seizure onset zone detection using fMRI data, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art vision transformers, large vision models, and knowledge-based systems, achieving an average F1 score of 90.2% while maintaining an overall F1 score of 85.0% across multi-center datasets.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe authors introduce an algorithm for generalizing to unknown domains using only training data from a single known domain, \"RareSaGE\", which proposes to integrate domain-invariant expert knowledge with neural networks for the problem of rare class classification. Their method achieves improved performance for this task compared to several neural network- and expert knowledge-based techniques.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper focuses on a lesser known, but still seemingly important problem which deserves attention. They test on a realistic dataset comprised of medical data sampled from real centers, demonstrating real life applicability.\n2. The method is seemingly fairly technically novel. The rarity quantification doesn't seem novel (they cite Li et al), but overall, the combination of expert knowledge (an old field) with modern neural network models is interesting and unusual.\n3. Improvements over the compared baselines are significant for all metrics (except maybe precision) (Table 1)\n4. The intuition behind the method is reasonable, and the formalism discussed does help with understanding this. The reasoning behind \"rationale for definition 3.1\" makes sense, i.e., explaining the challenges in working with rare classes with respect to class entropy.\n5. I think the four characterizations of a rare event make sense (not sure if these are novel or not?), although discrimination and significance may be a bit redundant.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n**Major:**\n1. **Generally limited experiments (don't even begin until page 9):** I would suggest moving many of the less-important dataset, algorithm and method details into the supplementary, and filling the missing space with more experiments, especially those considering ablation studies, failure cases for your method, computational analyses, and others. The biggest issues are as follows.\n    1. For a method defined in such generality, the experiments are quite limited: just a case study based on one fMRI datasets. This is a big negative, because it is unclear if the method could generalize to other problems, or if it was bespoke to (or developed specifically for) this case study. This hurts the paper's suitability for ICLR, as the larger impact on machine learning is not clear to me, which would require testing on other datasets/problem settings/etc.\n    2. Moreover, while the improvements over the compared baselines are significant for all metrics (except maybe precision) the comparison/baseline models may not be sufficient:\n        - I'm not an expert in domain generalization, but are the comparison models in Table 1 really proper baselines (maybe another reviewer can chime in)? Simple training or finetuning on one domain and testing on another domain (as well as the knowledge-based systems) doesn't seem like a strong, appropriate baseline. Are there better unknown domain generalization techniques which should have been tested?\n        - Alternatively, what about comparing to one-class-classification methods, i.e. OOD/anomaly-detection methods? This is also a large body of work which seems suitable. At the very least, why weren't these discussed in the related work?\n        - why wasn't AUC presented if sensitivity and precision were also presented? This would be a better general performance metric than accuracy for accounting for class imbalance.\n\t\n2. **Lack of ablation/hyperparameter sensitivity studies:**\n    1. this method has quite a few moving parts, which each could be brittle. The more of these moving parts that there are, the more ways that the method could fail when extended to new datasets/problems. It is important to consider how changing or removing one component would affect the performance, in order to judge how reliant to algorithm is on that component. However, the paper critically lacks any ablation/sensitivity studies for such hyperparameters/settings. I will discuss potential ablation studies which could be done, but I challenge the authors to think of more. Some examples:\n        1. On pg. 4, a rare class is defined by a 2-sigma distance from the mean class entropy. Why/how was 2 sigma chosen? This is seemingly an important parameter, yet you do no ablation/sensitivity studies on the effect of different values for this (number of sigmas used to define a rare class)\n        2. Algorithm 1 is quite complex, additionally with certain steps not quantitatively/explicitly defined.\n        3. The use of PCA on clip features may have limitations, as its linearity may be too much of a restriction. Why wasn't some form of nonlinear component/degrees-of-freedom analysis tested as well?\n        3. The form of the expert knowledge in the tested scenario (Eq. 6) is quite specific. Are there viable alternatives to this formulation that could have been tested on this dataset? Also, in general, what is the feasibility for converting expert knowledge into this format?\n\t\t\t\n**Minor:**\n1. More clear, technical method details are needed in the abstract and introduction to be clear what these contributions are. For example:\n    1. In the abstract: \"This paper addresses … even with limited data availability.\" This really lacks in explicit details on how the method actually works. how is this ranking done, specifically? is it via a novel algorithm? also, what does \"focused handling\" mean? and how is domain-invariant knowledge \"integrated\"? These questions could be gleaned from the main text of the paper, but a better level of detail could still be provided in the abstract with less vague wording.\n    2. Similarly in the introduction, more technical details are needed. Your repeatedly describe the \"integration\" of domain invariant expert knowledge with deep learning, but I'm unclear from reading this what this actually explicitly describes.\n2. Misleading claims/vague wording:\n    1. In the introduction, you say \"This concept is particularly crucial in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) for medicine, where the aim is to accurately diagnose new patient cases across centers\". This is misleading. AI for medicine extends far beyond diagnosis, including tasks such as segmentation, registration, harmonization, etc… and that's just for images, not including AI for medicine beyond images.\n    2. \"In medical imaging, there are various factors …  acute disorders\" also in the introduction; what are the \"classes\" being described here? I'm not sure if this is really intra-class variability (at least since you don't explain what the classes are here), its really just various factors that can contribute to domain shift problems in medical datasets.\n    3. \"In the medical diagnosis and disease detection domain, where data is often limited … variability in rare event characteristics. \" in the abstract is phrased confusingly. in the first sentence, is performance poor on the data because of limited data, rare cases of interest, or both? Maybe say that the second sentence describes a problem which exacerbates the problem described in the first sentence.\n3. Other missing technical details:\n    1. how is feature overlap/resemblance (described in the first paragraph of Sec. 3.2 actually computed? cosine similarity of the feature vectors?\n    2. Algorithm 1 shouldn't really be labeled as an \"algorithm\" in my opinion, because many of the steps are not defined explicitly, and left up to interpretation. More details are needed.\n    3. They provided anonymous code link in Sec. 4.1 is broken. It would have been helpful to see how such a novel and relatively complex algorithm was implemented in practice.\n4. Writing/clarity issues: the paper suffers from issues in writing quality, including clarity and typos, discussed next. For example:\n    1. The paper can be a bit challenging to read, not because of technical details, but because redundant information is often provided (see for example, \"solution overview\" and \"solution details\" could certainly be shortened and combined in 3.2)\n    2. Many sentences are terse and relatively telegraphic. The paper is still understandable, but could have better flow and general writing.\n    3. There is a too-long run-on sentence in \"To improve SDG for rare events, leveraging expert knowledge such as clinical opinion on …, has immense potential\" in the introduction.\n5. Typos/formatting issues:\n    1. In the abstract: \"Although extensively studied in image classification, there is a lack of prior work on SDG for rare event or image classification in imbalanced dataset\"\n        1. also, this is phrased confusingly. maybe say extensively studied in classification of balanced datasets?  But is having an imbalanced dataset not just kind of a triviality?\n    2. also in abstract \"integrates domain-invariant knowledge on rare event\" another typo.\n    3. Also in the intro, page 2 \"with DL using pre-trained large vision model (LVM) \"\n    4. There seems to be an issue in how in-text citations are formatted: no spacing between them, not parenthetical, etc. Makes it a bit harder to read the paper.\n    5. Why are the equations written with such tiny text? They require zooming in just to read. I'm not sure if this formatting modification is allowed for ICLR.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Is \"single domain generalization\" a common term when describing your problem scenario? it sounds like it describes generalizing TO a single domain, not training on a single one and being able to generalize to unknown ones.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The authors propose a method that utilizes a pre-trained large vision model to rank classes by their similarity to rare events, enabling focused classification. By integrating domain-invariant expert knowledge with data-driven deep learning, the approach improves model robustness and performance, even with scarce data. A case study on detecting seizure onset zones using fMRI data shows that this method achieves an average F1 score of 90.2%.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThis paper addresses an interesting and important problem: how to leverage large vision models (LVMs) to tackle rare diseases, which involve imbalanced, infrequent cases and domain shifts. While there are many SDG methods available, the authors claim that none have been specifically applied to rare cases in medical data. It appears that the authors are addressing a new problem.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nProblematic Settings\n\n1. While there are currently no methods addressing SDG in the context of limited data and rare diseases, this setting appears to combine elements of SDG with few-shot imbalanced classification. If a SDG method is sufficiently robust, it could potentially be integrated with existing imbalanced learning or rare disease fine-tuning techniques to effectively address this issue. However, the authors lack experiments to validate this point, which raises questions about the relevance of this particular setting in the field. The authors have the opportunity to tackle a significant challenge: how to integrate large vision models (LVMs) for rare disease classification, taking into account that rare diseases can vary in size, may be in-domain or out-of-domain, and may be either imbalanced or balanced, thereby providing a more comprehensive framework.\n\nLimited Discussions and Comparisons of Results\n\n2. The authors have not compared their approach with existing SDG and imbalanced learning methods, which diminishes the convincing nature of their experiments and calls into question their claim of being state-of-the-art (SOTA).\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease see my comments above\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 3",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to TMI:**  \n✅ The manuscript proposes *RareSaGe*, a methodological framework for *Single-Domain Generalization (SDG)* targeting *rare event detection in medical images*. Its focus on integrating discriminative expert knowledge with data-driven deep learning (DL) for improved generalization is methodological rather than purely application-oriented. The case study — seizure onset zone (SOZ) detection from fMRI — is used to validate the general method. This aligns with *IEEE TMI’s methodological scope* (imaging algorithms, integration of machine learning with imaging).  \n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level:**  \nThe paper identifies a gap in prior SDG literature: lack of techniques handling *rare class problems* (imbalanced and limited data). It defines a new theoretical framing (entropy-based rarity criterion) and integrates symbolic expert knowledge with DL to handle overlap classes. Methodological novelty lies in:  \n- an entropy-driven definition of “rare class,”  \n- algorithmic framework (RareSaGe) combining DL and expert knowledge via a cascading classifier design,  \n- demonstration of domain invariance and single-domain generalization without target data.  \nThis is *conceptually distinct* but somewhat incremental in its integration aspects (DL + knowledge-based models). The contribution would reach TMI’s novelty threshold if claims on generalizability and cross-center validation are well substantiated.  \n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor:**  \n- Mathematical formalization (entropy-based rarity, CRLB rationale) is solid, though some derivations could benefit from clearer connection to performance metrics.  \n- Experimental design includes cross-center (A↔B) and aggregated validations, with appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1).  \n- Reported F1 > 90% across domains, demonstrating robustness — yet statistical significance or uncertainty quantification beyond SDs is limited.  \n- Datasets are realistic (fMRI from pediatric/adult centers), IRB-approved, anonymized; however, generalizability beyond SOZ detection is not empirically shown.  \n- Reproducibility: code link provided, though anonymized (acceptable for review).  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation:**  \nGenerally clear and well organized. However:  \n- Long sentences and heavy use of inline references hinder readability.  \n- Figures and tables are appropriate but schematic (Fig. 1 could better indicate data flow and model interaction).  \n- Some grammatical errors and formatting inconsistencies (e.g., equation alignment).  \n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance:**  \n✔ Explicit IRB approval and anonymization are stated.  \n✔ Code and data (anonymized link) provided.  \nOverall compliance is adequate.  \n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe manuscript presents *RareSaGe*, a novel algorithm for detecting rare events in medical imaging under single-domain settings. It introduces an entropy-based quantification of rarity and integrates expert knowledge–derived symbolic features through a quadratic optimization classifier with deep learning classifiers that handle overlapping classes. Using resting-state fMRI data for seizure onset zone localization across two centers, the method demonstrates strong cross-center and aggregated performance, reportedly outperforming standard CNNs, Vision Transformers, and knowledge-only systems.\n\n**2. Strengths**  \n- Clear methodological focus on the *SDG + rare-event* intersection.  \n- Innovative fusion of domain knowledge with DL in a structured, theoretically supported framework.  \n- Empirical validation across institutions, with substantial improvement in F1 scores.  \n- Conceptual interpretability through propositional knowledge features, enhancing trust and explainability in clinical AI.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**  \n- Limited generalization evidence beyond a single clinical application (SOZ detection).  \n- Some theoretical constructs (entropy definition vs Fisher information) are insufficiently validated empirically.  \n- Absence of ablation study quantifying the contribution of each module (e.g., knowledge integration vs DL alone).  \n- Presentation occasionally dense; method flow and parameter choices (e.g., choice of tc = 0.9) need clearer justification.  \n- Comparisons to related hybrid or physics-informed learning techniques could be expanded.  \n\n**4. Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological clarity:** Please provide a detailed pseudocode or diagram clarifying how DL and knowledge modules interact at inference (currently only briefly described).  \n2. **Ablation analysis:** Quantify how much each component (entropy selection, overlap separation, knowledge QO machine) contributes to the final performance.  \n3. **Theoretical justification:** Validate the entropy–information relationship empirically (show correlation between class entropy and misclassification rate).  \n4. **Generalizability:** Discuss applicability beyond the fMRI task—would RareSaGe generalize to other modalities (CT, histopathology)?  \n5. **Statistical robustness:** Add confidence intervals or statistical tests comparing baseline vs proposed method.  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**  \n- Improve figure captions and ensure all acronyms (e.g., QO, RSN) are defined where first used.  \n- Check reference formatting for consistency (e.g., MICCAI volumes, doi spacing).  \n- Correct some grammar/typographical errors.  \n- Clarify whether the hybrid method was tuned using validation from the same domain only (to ensure proper SDG evaluation).  \n\n**6. Overall Recommendation:**  \n**Major Revision** – The work demonstrates substantial methodological potential and solid experimental basis, but requires additional clarification, broader generalization evidence, and minor writing improvement to meet TMI publication standards.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4/5 (high confidence in assessment; moderate confidence in reproducibility of quantitative claims).\n\n---\n\n**Summary Statement:**  \n*RareSaGe* presents a promising framework linking expert knowledge with data-driven learning to address single-domain generalization for rare-event imaging. Technically sound and novel enough for *IEEE TMI*, contingent upon stronger experimental substantiation and clearer presentation.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces RareSaGe, a novel algorithm that integrates domain-invariant expert knowledge with deep learning (DL) techniques for single domain generalization (SDG) in rare event detection in medical imaging. The focus is on addressing the challenges posed by limited and imbalanced data, as well as overlapping data and knowledge rules between classes. The proposed approach utilizes a large vision model (LVM) and class-wise entropy to identify the most similar class to the rare event class, and then employs both DL and knowledge-based models to enhance the detection of rare events. The paper presents a case study on seizure onset zone (SOZ) detection using fMRI data, demonstrating that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DL techniques and knowledge-based systems, achieving an average F1 score of 90.2% across multi-center datasets.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The manuscript introduces a promising approach for rare event detection in medical imaging, leveraging expert knowledge alongside DL. However, the novelty is somewhat diminished by the fact that the integration of expert knowledge with DL models has been explored in previous literature. The authors need to provide a clearer distinction and comparison with existing methods that combine DL and expert knowledge, particularly in the context of rare event detection.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is performed on two datasets from different centers, with a focus on cross-validation and aggregated validation. While these experiments are thorough, the reliance on only two datasets limits the generalizability of the findings. The authors should consider expanding the evaluation to include more diverse datasets, possibly from different imaging modalities, to further validate the robustness of their approach.\n\n3. Comparisons: The performance comparisons against state-of-the-art DL techniques and knowledge-based systems are compelling, but the authors should provide more detailed comparisons with recent advancements in rare event detection, particularly those that incorporate expert knowledge or domain-specific constraints. This would help establish the incremental contribution of the proposed method.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript mentions that code and data are available, which is commendable. However, the reproducibility section should be expanded to include more detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, hyperparameter tuning procedures, and any preprocessing steps. This would facilitate independent replication of the results.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity of Figures: Some figures (e.g., Figure 1) could benefit from additional labels and annotations to improve clarity. Specifically, the steps involved in the model schematic should be more clearly delineated.\n\n2. Notation Consistency: There are inconsistencies in the notation used throughout the manuscript, particularly in the definitions and descriptions of class-wise entropy and overlap class extraction. The authors should ensure that the notation is consistent and well-defined.\n\n3. Acronyms and Terminology: Several acronyms and technical terms are introduced without clear definitions (e.g., \"LVM\", \"CLIP\"). Providing a glossary or defining these terms when they are first introduced would enhance the readability of the manuscript.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: There are a few typographical errors throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). These should be corrected to maintain the professional quality of the paper.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: detecting rare events in medical imaging datasets that are often limited and imbalanced. The proposed RareSaGe algorithm, which integrates expert knowledge with DL, represents a potentially valuable innovation in the field of single domain generalization. However, the evaluation is currently limited to two datasets, which may not fully demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the approach. The reproducibility of the method is also somewhat uncertain due to incomplete details in the methodological description. Overall, while the idea has promise, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include a broader range of recent advancements in rare event detection, strengthen validation across diverse datasets, and provide more detailed methodological descriptions to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) approaches have become popular for improved reconstruction of fast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Even though PD-DL offers higher acceleration rates compared to existing clinical fast MRI techniques, their use has been limited outside specialized MRI centers. One impediment for their deployment is the difficulties with generalization to pathologies or population groups that are not well-represented in training sets. This has been noted in several studies, and fine-tuning on target populations to improve reconstruction has been suggested. However, current training approaches for PD-DL training require access to raw k-space measurements, which is typically only available at specialized MRI centers that have research agreements for such data access. This is especially an issue for rural and underserved areas, where commercial MRI scanners only provide access to a final reconstructed image. To tackle these challenges, we propose CUPID for high-quality PD-DL training, using only routine clinical reconstructed images exported from an MRI scanner. CUPID evaluates the goodness of the output with a compressibility-based approach, while ensuring that the output stays consistent with the clinical parallel imaging reconstruction through well-designed perturbations. Our results show that CUPID achieves similar quality compared to well-established PD-DL training strategies that require raw k-space data access, while outperforming conventional compressed sensing (CS) and state-of-the-art generative methods. We also demonstrate its effectiveness in a zero-shot training setup for retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled acquisitions, attesting to its minimal training burden. As an approach that radically deviates from existing strategies, CUPID presents an opportunity to provide equitable access to fast MRI for underserved populations in an attempt to reduce the inequalities associated with this expensive imaging modality.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe article proposes a deep-learning reconstruction method without having access to multi-coil $k$-space data. For the full-column-rank forward operator $E_{\\Omega}$ and the under-sampled $k$-space $\\textbf{y}$, the authors assume access to $E_{\\Omega}^+ \\textbf{y}$ where $+$ denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse. Compared to having access to fully sampled $k$-space as in fully supervised reconstruction, or undersampled $k$-space as in self-supervised reconstruction, this assumption is less restrictive. The proposed method was shown to perform on par with PD-DL methods requiring $k$-space data at relatively low acceleration rates ($4\\times$).\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The data access assumption is less restrictive compared to fully- and self-supervised reconstruction methods, and the article focuses on a real-life problem, as raw k-space access is a known limitation in this field.\n2. The method is physics-based; thus, it is expected to be less prone to hallucinations compared to methods that do not utilize the forward operator.\n3. The method was tested in various settings, focusing on both retrospective and prospective undersampling.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The quantitative results table is missing the standard error of the mean, which is crucial for a fair comparison.\n2. It is incorrect to say that equispaced undersampling patterns were not explored in score-based models. In fact, the authors have already cited at least one article (\"Robust Compressed Sensing MRI with Deep Generative Priors\") that explored equispaced undersampling, discussing it not only in the appendix but also in the main text (e.g., Fig. 2, 9, 10). \n3. The generative method baseline is weak and outdated, given how rapidly state-of-the-art methods are advancing.  Several approaches published in the last 12 months can achieve better results. Including this particular method is fine, but labeling it as state-of-the-art is misleading.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Does the clinical PI reconstruction readily allow saving the complex-valued image without any research agreements, or does it only allow the magnitude image to be saved? I am asking because it is rare to see a DICOM dataset containing anything other than magnitude images.\n2. Regardless of whether ScoreMRI is state-of-the-art, its performance appears unexpectedly low. Is it possible that it was significantly under-trained? In our experience, these models require much longer training times compared to unrolled networks, which might explain why it underperforms even at $4\\times$.\n3. The choice of perturbations seems somewhat arbitrary. Could you elaborate on this choice? Learning the perturbations simultaneously with reinforcement learning could also be a potential direction for future work.\n4.

The key idea is through using random perturbations.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. I like the idea of using random image domain perturbations, sounds like a good way to capture pior distribution.\n2. I appreciate the authors for the experiments on the prospective undersampled MRI reconstruction, which is a very important experiment for all MRI reconstruction tasks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nOverall, there are a few weaknesses that concerns me:\n1. I didn't really buy the idea of this rural region raw-data access. why we need raw-data? its for the training purpose! we already have a great number of raw k-space data (from fastMRI, mridata.org and others), as long as we have a good model trained, the rural regions can just use it without any training. In the end of the day, all MRI scanner will sample raw k-space data, so the whole motivation doesn't sound solid to me. \nMeanwhile, from what i understand from your method, the input is CG-SENSE of undersampled MRI, is it realistic? the input quality is not really diagnoistic.\n\n2. The presentation is not very clear and the paper is not well-writtened, all the method section for your method is condensed to one *single* page with a figure (figure 2), i have to go back and forth to understand whats R, whats DF, and how you do the perturbations, thats supposed to be the main part of the paper.\n\n3. The score-MRI results look kinda weird to me, try to look at other generative models. It shouldn't be that bad.\n\n4. Figure 3, the result doesn't look good to me, over smoothing textures.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. how do your method compared to single-coil DL-based reconstruction.\n2. how sensitive is your method to different input? (different vendors tend to have different reconstruction pipelines.)\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 5",

The central innovation lies in employing random perturbations to enhance reconstruction quality.\n\n### Major Comments:\n1. The justification for focusing on rural regions and raw data access appears weak. The reliance on raw data seems unnecessary for training, as there are numerous available datasets (e.g., fastMRI, mridata.org). A well-trained model should suffice for rural applications without requiring additional training. This undermines the paper's motivation.\n2. The method's input, CG-SENSE of undersampled MRI data, raises concerns about realism and diagnostic quality.\n3. Presentation clarity is lacking; the methods section is condensed into a single page accompanied by a figure (Figure 2). This leads to confusion regarding key terms (e.g., R, DF) and the perturbation process, which are fundamental to the paper.\n4. The score-MRI results need further scrutiny, as they present inconsistencies compared to existing generative models—this raises questions about validity.\n5. The results shown in Figure 3 indicate over-smoothing of textures, further questioning the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Minor Comments:\n- Consider revising the clarity of figures and terminology used throughout the manuscript to enhance reader comprehension.\n- There are some grammatical issues that need to be addressed, particularly “well-writtened.”\n\n### Summary Paragraph:\nIn summary, the manuscript demonstrates potential significance in addressing MRI reconstruction within rural contexts, showing innovation through random perturbations. However, evaluation appears flawed due to weak justification regarding the need for raw data and real-world applicability. Reproducibility is also a concern, given issues with clarity and presentation. Overall, while the paper captures important issues in MRI technology, revisions are required to strengthen its contributions and delivery.\n\n### Decision Recommendation:\nMajor revision",

The approach introduces random perturbations in the image domain to capture data priors and improve reconstruction quality. While the idea is interesting and potentially useful, the paper’s presentation and clarity are limited, and the motivation for the proposed setting is not fully convincing.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Motivation and Practicality:** The rationale regarding rural regions lacking raw data access is unconvincing. In practice, raw k-space data are widely available through public datasets (e.g., fastMRI, mridata.org) for training purposes. Once trained, models can be deployed broadly without requiring local raw data. Furthermore, MRI scanners inherently collect raw data for reconstruction, which challenges the stated motivation.  \n2. **Input Data and Realism:** The method appears to use CG-SENSE reconstructions of undersampled MRI as input, but the diagnostic realism of such inputs is questionable. The manuscript should clarify the realism and feasibility of this assumption.  \n3. **Method Description and Clarity:** The methods section is condensed into roughly one page and lacks sufficient detail. It is difficult to follow key definitions (e.g., “R,” “DF”) and the perturbation process. This section should be expanded and more clearly explained.  \n4. **Experimental Results:** The Score-MRI reconstructions appear unusual compared with other generative reconstruction methods and should be critically analyzed. Figure 3 results exhibit oversmoothing and loss of texture detail.  \n5. **Comparative Evaluation:** A comparison with single-coil deep learning–based reconstructions would provide valuable context.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis work proposes CUPID (Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity), a novel training method for physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) MRI reconstruction that operates without requiring raw k-space data access. The method addresses the limitation that current PD-DL approaches require raw MRI measurements, which are typically unavailable outside specialized research centers, particularly in rural and underserved areas. CUPID combines two loss terms: a compressibility-based term using reweighted ℓ1 norm on wavelet coefficients (Equation 8) and a parallel imaging fidelity term that ensures consistency through carefully designed perturbations (Equation 9). The approach can operate in both database training and zero-shot subject-specific modes using only routine clinical DICOM images. Experimental validation on fastMRI knee and brain datasets with retrospective R=4 undersampling and prospective R=9 brain acquisition demonstrates performance comparable to supervised and self-supervised methods while outperforming compressed sensing and generative approaches.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - The parallel imaging fidelity loss in Equation 9 lacks theoretical justification for why the expectation over perturbations should approximate true parallel imaging consistency, as no convergence analysis is provided\n  - The notation switches inconsistently between f(yΩ, EΩ; θ) in Section 2.2 and f(xPI, EΩ) in Section 3 without clear explanation (Page 5, line 226-227)\n  - The reweighted ℓ1 formulation in Equation 8 uses x(m) from \"mth reweighting step\" but the iterative reweighting procedure is not mathematically defined or described\n\n• **Limited experimental validation scope**\n  - Only uniform/equidistant undersampling patterns are evaluated (Section 4.1, line 294-295), which represents a narrow subset of clinical acceleration strategies and limits generalizability assessment\n  - The prospective validation uses only a single high-field 7T acquisition at R=9 (Section 4.1, lines 309-311), providing insufficient evidence for clinical translation across different field strengths and acceleration rates\n  - Comparison with generative methods is limited to ScoreMRI only (Table 1), missing evaluation against other state-of-the-art diffusion-based reconstruction approaches mentioned in Section 2.3\n\n• **Perturbation design lacks principled foundation**\n  - The choice of perturbations as \"randomly rotated and positioned letters, numbers, card suits\" (Page 5, lines 251-252) appears arbitrary without theoretical or empirical justification for why these specific shapes are optimal\n  - The fold-over constraint design is described only conceptually (Page 5, lines 249-250) without mathematical formulation or validation that perturbations truly satisfy parallel imaging resolvability\n  - The ablation study on perturbation number (Appendix B.1, Figure 7) shows only K∈{1,3,6,10} without exploring the convergence behavior or computational trade-offs systematically\n\n• **Insufficient analysis of clinical deployment constraints**\n  - The discussion of filtering operations in Section 4.6 (lines 491-500) acknowledges limitations with vendor processing but provides no quantitative assessment of robustness to these common clinical modifications\n  - The magnitude-only DICOM limitation (Section 4.6, lines 507-518) is mentioned as future work but represents a significant practical barrier that undermines the claimed accessibility for underserved areas\n  - No computational cost analysis is provided for the training procedure, which is crucial for assessing feasibility in resource-limited settings as claimed in the motivation\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Strengthen mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that the expectation over perturbations in Equation 9 converges to a meaningful parallel imaging consistency measure, including convergence rates and required number of samples\n  - Standardize notation throughout the manuscript, clearly defining when and why the function signature changes from f(yΩ, EΩ; θ) to f(xPI, EΩ) with explicit parameter handling\n  - Formalize the iterative reweighting procedure for Equation 8 with algorithmic description, convergence criteria, and relationship to standard reweighted ℓ1 minimization\n\n• **Expand experimental validation comprehensively**\n  - Include evaluation on multiple undersampling patterns (random, variable density, radial) across different acceleration rates (R=2,3,6,8) to demonstrate broader clinical applicability beyond uniform patterns\n  - Conduct prospective validation across multiple field strengths (1.5T, 3T, 7T) and anatomical regions with varying acceleration rates to establish generalization capabilities for clinical deployment\n  - Compare against additional state-of-the-art generative reconstruction methods including recent diffusion models and score-based approaches beyond ScoreMRI\n\n• **Develop principled perturbation methodology**\n  - Establish theoretical criteria for perturbation design based on parallel imaging theory, providing mathematical conditions that ensure resolvability and optimal reconstruction performance\n  - Formalize the fold-over constraint mathematically with explicit conditions relating perturbation spatial frequency content to acceleration factor and coil sensitivity patterns\n  - Conduct systematic ablation studies exploring perturbation characteristics (shape complexity, intensity distribution, spatial frequency content) with convergence analysis for different K values\n\n• **Address practical deployment considerations quantitatively**\n  - Evaluate robustness to common vendor filtering operations through controlled experiments with simulated and real clinical processing pipelines, providing quantitative performance degradation analysis\n  - Implement and validate solutions for magnitude-only DICOM reconstruction including joint phase and coil sensitivity estimation within the CUPID framework\n  - Provide detailed computational cost analysis comparing training time, memory requirements, and hardware specifications needed for CUPID versus existing methods in resource-constrained environments",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\n### This manuscript introduces CUPID (Compressibility-inspired Unsupervised Learning via Parallel Imaging Fidelity), a novel approach for training physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models for fast MRI reconstruction using only routine clinical reconstructed images (DICOM format) without requiring raw k-space data. The proposed method combines compressibility-based loss terms with parallel imaging fidelity to ensure high-quality reconstructions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CUPID through extensive evaluations on both retrospective and prospective undersampled datasets, comparing it against various supervised and unsupervised baselines. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for addressing the limitations of raw k-space data access is compelling.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While CUPID is a novel approach, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed discussion on how it compares to existing methods that aim to train models without raw k-space data. Specifically, the authors should clarify how CUPID's compressibility-based loss and parallel imaging fidelity differ from other self-supervised and generative methods that operate without raw data access.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation primarily focuses on retrospective undersampling and includes a limited prospective study. More extensive prospective evaluations on different anatomies and acceleration rates would strengthen the claim of generalizability. Additionally, the inclusion of more diverse datasets and anatomical sites would enhance the validity of the findings.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares CUPID with a variety of methods, including supervised PD-DL, self-supervised learning (SSDU), and generative models (ScoreMRI). However, the comparisons lack some recent advancements in unsupervised and self-supervised learning for MRI reconstruction. Including these methods would provide a more comprehensive benchmark.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors mention that code will be released upon acceptance, which is positive. However, the manuscript could be improved by providing more detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, including hyperparameters and training protocols. This would facilitate reproducibility and allow for independent verification of the results.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Clarity in Notation: Some sections, such as the introduction of the parallel imaging fidelity term, could benefit from clearer explanations and notation. The notation for the forward operator and perturbations needs to be consistent and well-defined.\n   \n2. Figures and Tables: Figures 3 and 4 are somewhat cluttered. Providing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions would improve readability. Additionally, the figures could benefit from clearer labeling and legends to aid in understanding.\n   \n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definitions. Providing a glossary or defining acronyms when they are first introduced would enhance clarity.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues: There are a few typographical errors throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" and \"undersampling maskes\". Careful proofreading would improve the manuscript's readability.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in fast MRI reconstruction by proposing CUPID, a method that enables high-quality PD-DL training using only routine clinical reconstructed images. The innovation lies in combining compressibility-based loss terms with parallel imaging fidelity, which is a novel approach to mitigate the need for raw k-space data. The evaluation is comprehensive, covering both retrospective and prospective undersampling, and the results demonstrate that CUPID performs comparably to or better than existing methods that require raw data access. However, the evaluation could be strengthened with more diverse datasets and anatomical sites. The reproducibility of the approach is promising, but more detailed methodological descriptions are needed to ensure independent replication. Overall, the manuscript has significant merit and addresses a pressing issue in MRI reconstruction, but further enhancements in evaluation and reproducibility would elevate its impact.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand their comparative analysis to include recent advancements in unsupervised and self-supervised learning for MRI reconstruction. They should also conduct more extensive prospective evaluations across different anatomies and acceleration rates. Additionally, providing more detailed descriptions of the experimental setup and training protocols would enhance reproducibility.",

Meanwhile, current general-domain multimodal models for videos still lack the capabilities to understand and engage in conversations about surgical videos. One major contributing factor is the absence of datasets in the surgical field. In this paper, we create a new dataset, Surg-QA, consisting of 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs, the largest of its kind so far. To build such a dataset, we propose a novel two-stage question-answer generation pipeline with LLM to learn surgical knowledge in a structured manner from the publicly available surgical lecture videos. The pipeline breaks down the generation process into two stages to significantly reduce the task complexity, allowing us to use a more affordable, locally deployed open-source LLM than the premium paid LLM services. It also mitigates the risk of LLM hallucinations during question-answer generation, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the generated data. We further train LLaVA-Surg, a novel vision-language conversational assistant capable of answering open-ended questions about surgical videos, on this Surg-QA dataset, and conduct comprehensive evaluations on zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks. We show that LLaVA-Surg significantly outperforms all previous general-domain models, demonstrating exceptional multimodal conversational skills in answering open-ended questions about surgical videos. We will release our code, model, and the instruction-tuning dataset.",

To support this, the authors developed Surg-QA, a large-scale dataset containing 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs, generated through a structured two-stage question-answer pipeline. This pipeline helps extract structured knowledge from surgical lecture videos, enabling the LLaVA-Surg model to understand complex surgical procedures and answer open-ended questions in a zero-shot setting. The model leverages CLIP for visual encoding and is fine-tuned on Surg-QA to specialize in surgical video question-answering, achieving superior performance compared to existing general-domain models.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.\tThe authors provide a novel dataset, Surg-QA, which is a significant resource for training multimodal surgical models, covering diverse surgical procedures and question-answer pairs.\n2.\tThe two-stage pipeline for question-answer generation mitigates hallucinations in LLM outputs, resulting in higher quality and reliability of generated data.\n3.\tLLaVA-Surg demonstrates notable improvements over general multimodal models in zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks, showcasing its efficacy in understanding surgical context.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The paper should compare its model with recent multimodal LLM approaches, specifically ReAct (Yao et al., 2023), which combines reasoning and action for complex tasks.\n[1] Yao, S., Zhao, J., Yu, D., Du, N., Shafran, I., Narasimhan, K., & Cao, Y. (2023, January). ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models. In International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR).\n2. Using CLIP for frame-by-frame encoding lacks temporal modeling and increases processing costs and redundancy, burdening the LLM as frame count grows.\n3. The paper lacks an in-depth error analysis, especially regarding potential hallucinations or misunderstandings in complex surgical scenarios. Although the authors claim to reduce hallucinations, achieving perfect performance seems challenging.\n4. The model’s adaptability to other medical or clinical fields is unclear, as broader evaluations on datasets like RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA are missing, which may limit its wider applicability.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Does splitting video into frames for CLIP’s visual encoder lead to a loss of spatiotemporal information, and wouldn’t a video encoder like Video Swin Transformer [2] better capture temporal dynamics?\n[2] Liu, Z., Ning, J., Cao, Y., Wei, Y., Zhang, Z., Lin, S., & Hu, H. (2022). Video swin transformer. In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 3202-3211).\n2. How does LLaVA-Surg perform compared to other state-of-the-art multimodal methods? In addition to general multimodal models, a detailed comparison with models like ReAct would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Has comparison with other two-stage methods [3] in VQA task been overlooked?\n[3] Gai, X., Zhou, C., Liu, J., Feng, Y., Wu, J., & Liu, Z. (2024).

Is the two-stage question-answer generation process applicable to other medical fields, and if so, what adjustments would be required? Additionally, validating the method’s performance on public datasets like RAD, SLAKE, and PathVQA would strengthen its generalizability.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The paper provides detailed comparisons with existing general-purpose and surgical-purpose datasets. Lastly, the authors provide a human and LLM evaluation of the dataset, showing consistent scores.\n\n### Soundness: 4\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\n- **Clarity**: The paper is well-written and easy to follow. \n- **Contributions**: This work makes a significant contribution to the development of surgical chat assistants. The dataset contains a wider range of surgical QAs compared to previous works. The proposed model and dataset may be valuable resources for researchers in this area.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- **Dataset Availability**: The surgical videos are available on WebSurg and are not a contribution of the authors. Therefore, the data availability may be subject to license changes from the content owners and WebSurg.\n- **Hallucinations and Data Quality**: As the authors mentioned, there may be hallucinations in the dataset, since it is automatically generated. The authors provide chatGPT and human evaluations, but that is not enough to infer the data quality.\n- **Model Availability**: It is not possible to reproduce the results since the model is not available yet, but enough details are provided to support the paper.\n\n### Questions\n\nThe paper is very well written and addresses its objectives.

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n   The paper introduces **LLaVA‑Surg**, a multimodal vision–language model for surgical video understanding and conversation, together with **Surg‑QA**, a 102 k‑pair surgical video question–answer dataset generated by a structured two‑stage pipeline.  Although the target use case is the surgical domain, the contribution is largely methodological: building and evaluating a multimodal AI system that couples LLMs with video encoders.  That aligns reasonably with *IEEE TMI*’s scope of imaging methodology, machine learning, and computational analysis rather than purely clinical application. ✅\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \n   The novelty lies in (i) a two‑stage structured LLM pipeline to generate video–QA pairs that aim to reduce hallucination, and (ii) adaptation of visual–language architectures (CLIP + LLaMA) to model spatiotemporal surgical video data.  The proposed dataset scale is unprecedented for surgery videos.  However, parts of the model architecture and evaluation pipeline are close to prior art (Video‑LLaVA, Video‑ChatGPT), so the conceptual advance is moderate though useful.  The main novelty is practical—data generation and domain translation—rather than a new imaging theory.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \n   – Implementation details are explicitly documented: dataset sources (WebSurg, CholecT50), number of procedures, training setup, hardware, and hyperparameters.  \n   – The two‑stage data pipeline is well motivated but only partially validated; quality control of automatically generated QA pairs appears anecdotal.  \n   – Quantitative evaluation relies heavily on GPT‑based automatic scoring, supplemented by a small (n = 60) clinician validation showing correlation. Statistical significance or inter‑rater reliability is not reported.  \n   – Reproducibility is strong: authors state release of code, weights, and data; therefore experiments could be replicated.\n\n4. **Clarity & Presentation**  \n   Manuscript is clear, with appropriate figures, tables, and consistent terminology.  Some minor grammatical and spacing issues (“LLaV A‑Surg” artifacts) and typographical inconsistencies need correction, but overall readability is high.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \n   Data originate from publicly available, de‑identified surgical videos (WebSurg); no patient PII is included.  Authors commit to open‑sourcing under Creative Commons BY‑NC 4.0.  Ethical and licensing aspects appear properly considered.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \n   The manuscript proposes **LLaVA‑Surg**, a surgical video conversational assistant built by fine‑tuning a vision–language model (CLIP + LLaMA) on **Surg‑QA**, a new dataset of 102 k automatically generated surgical video QA pairs.  The dataset is produced via a two‑stage pipeline that extracts structured observations, reasons, and plans from transcribed surgical lectures using LLM prompting, aiming to reduce hallucination and cost.  The model is evaluated on zero‑shot surgical video QA tasks, outperforming general‑domain multimodal baselines (Video‑LLaVA, Video‑ChatGPT) and correlating well with clinician scoring.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n   * First large‑scale multimodal conversational dataset for surgery videos.  \n   * Practical innovation in structured Q&A generation mitigating hallucination.  \n   * Demonstrated improvement over multimodal baselines and quantitative clinician validation.  \n   * Clear reproducibility plan with public release of data and code.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n   * Architectural novelty is incremental; the framework closely follows prior general‑domain models.  \n   * Evaluation heavily depends on GPT‑scoring without strong human‑study validation.  \n   * Lack of rigorous uncertainty or error analysis; limited ablation on two‑stage pipeline benefits.  \n   * Clinical or imaging physics insights limited—targets more at AI engineering than imaging methodology per se.  \n   * Minor clarity and formatting issues.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n   1. **Positioning for TMI readers.** Clarify how the work advances medical‑imaging methodology beyond dataset creation.  Discuss broader implications for quantitative surgical video analysis (e.g., phase recognition, tool tracking).  \n   2. **Validation robustness.** Provide a larger‑scale human evaluation, or complementary objective metrics (e.g., BLEU/ROUGE, factual accuracy vs reference).  Report inter‑rater consistency between clinicians and GPT.  \n   3. **Ablation on pipeline.** Quantify how the two‑stage generation reduces hallucination relative to end‑to‑end prompting across multiple samples, not just anecdotal examples.  \n   4. **Generalizability.** Evaluate transfer to unseen surgical categories or other datasets (e.g., Cholec80‑VQA) to demonstrate domain robustness.  \n   5. **Ethical/compliance detail.** Add explicit statement of patient de‑identification and reuse permissions from WebSurg to conform to TMI reproducibility policies.\n\n5. **Minor Comments**  \n   * Fix typographical spacing (“LLaV A‑Surg → LLaVA‑Surg”), unify variable notation.  \n   * Some figures (e.g., Fig 4) contain small text—enlarge for print quality.  \n   * Refer to ICLR in‑review footers should be removed for journal submission.  \n   * Include statistical uncertainties (mean ± SD) in Table 3.  \n   * Verify citation formatting consistency (author–year vs numeric).  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation**  \n   **Major Revision.**  \n   The work is promising and methodologically sound but requires strengthened experimental validation and clearer alignment to TMI’s methodological focus.  With improved quantitative and statistical analyses, the contribution could meet TMI standards.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** 4 / 5 – High confidence in technical assessment; moderate confidence in ultimate journal fit.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Judgment:**  \nA solid and timely paper bridging multimodal LLMs and surgical video understanding.  Methodological rigor is acceptable, novelty moderate, and reproducibility excellent.

The authors address the lack of specialized datasets for training multimodal large language models (LLMs) in the surgical domain by creating Surg-QA, a large-scale dataset comprising over 102,000 surgical video-instruction pairs. The dataset is generated using a novel two-stage question-answer generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to extract and generate high-quality instructional content from surgical lecture videos. LLAVA-Surg is then trained on this dataset and evaluated on zero-shot surgical video question-answering tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing general-domain models.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning. The creation of Surg-QA and the development of LLAVA-Surg represent significant advancements in the field of multimodal surgical video understanding. However, the manuscript could benefit from a clearer distinction between LLAVA-Surg and existing multimodal models that handle video data. The authors should more explicitly discuss how LLAVA-Surg's approach to integrating visual and textual data differs from recent advancements in multimodal LLMs.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design. While the authors present comprehensive evaluations on Surg-QA, the scope of the evaluation could be expanded to include a broader range of surgical procedures and video modalities. Including additional datasets or synthetic video scenarios could provide a more robust validation of LLAVA-Surg's generalizability and effectiveness across different surgical contexts.\n   \n3. Comparisons. The comparisons with existing models are thorough, but the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations and potential biases inherent in the Surg-QA dataset. For instance, the reliance on surgical lecture videos might introduce biases that affect the model's performance on real surgical procedures. Addressing these limitations would strengthen the manuscript's argument for the significance of LLAVA-Surg.\n\n4. Reproducibility. The authors state that the code, model, and dataset will be released, which is commendable. However, the manuscript could provide more details on the specific conditions under which the data generation and model training were conducted. Clearer descriptions of the preprocessing steps, training protocols, and hyperparameters would enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures and Tables: Some figures, particularly Figures 4 and 5, are cluttered and could benefit from a more organized layout. For example, the treemap in Figure 4c could be simplified to improve readability.\n   \n2. Notation and Terminology: The manuscript occasionally uses inconsistent terminology, such as \"LLaV A-Surg\" and \"LLAVA-Surg\". Standardizing this notation would improve clarity.\n   \n3. Acronyms: Acronyms like \"VQA\" are used without definition in the text. Providing a brief explanation or defining these terms upon first use would be beneficial for readers unfamiliar with the terminology.\n   \n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors, such as \"video-instruction\" instead of \"video instruction,\" should be corrected for consistency.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(Focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\nThe manuscript addresses a significant gap in the availability of specialized datasets and models for surgical video understanding. The introduction of Surg-QA and the development of LLAVA-Surg represent innovative contributions to the field, offering promising advancements in multimodal conversational capabilities for surgical videos. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited to a single dataset, which affects the generalizability of the findings. The manuscript's reproducibility is strengthened by the planned release of code and data, but additional methodological details are needed. Overall, while the work has substantial merit, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI, particularly in terms of broader validation and detailed reproducibility information.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand their comparative analysis, strengthen the validation across different surgical datasets and procedures, and provide more detailed methodological descriptions to ensure reproducibility.",

While these models inherit the robust capabilities of foundational Large Language Models (LLMs), they also inherit susceptibility to hallucinations—a significant concern in high-stakes medical contexts where the margin for error is minimal. However, currently, there are no dedicated methods or benchmarks for hallucination detection and evaluation in the medical field. To bridge this gap, we introduce Med-HallMark, the first benchmark specifically designed for hallucination detection and evaluation within the medical multimodal domain. This benchmark provides multi-tasking hallucination support, multifaceted hallucination data, and hierarchical hallucination categorization. Furthermore, we propose the MediHall Score, a new medical evaluative metric designed to assess LVLMs' hallucinations through a hierarchical scoring system that considers the severity and type of hallucination, thereby enabling a granular assessment of potential clinical impacts. We also present MedihallDetector, a novel Medical LVLM engineered for precise hallucination detection, which employs multitask training for hallucination detection. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we establish baselines for popular LVLMs using our benchmark. The findings indicate that MediHall Score provides a more nuanced understanding of hallucination impacts compared to traditional metrics and demonstrate the enhanced performance of MedihallDetector. We hope this work can significantly improve the reliability of LVLMs in medical applications. All resources of this work have been released.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a hallucination detection and evaluation benchmark in the medical multimodal domain. Recognizing that large vision-language models often inherit hallucination tendencies from foundational large-language models, the authors propose a framework for more accurate and detailed hallucination assessment in high-stakes medical applications. \nThe paper makes three primary contributions: (i) Med-HallMark, the benchmark dedicated to medical hallucination detection (ii) MediHallDetector, a hallucination detection model tailored for the medical domain; and (iii) MediHall Score, an evaluative metric designed for hallucinations of different severity and types. \nThrough extensive experiments, the paper claims that MediHall Score provides more nuanced insights than traditional metrics and that MediHallDetector enhances hallucination detection performance in medical LVLMs.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper is well-motivated in that it addresses a critical and underexplored area in medical LVLMs: detecting and evaluating hallucinations, which is crucial for ensuring safety in clinical applications. The work frames hallucination detection specifically for the medical domain. The MediHall Score introduces a nuanced metric that prioritizes clinical impact by differentiating hallucinations based on their severity and type. The ablation study of different SFT methods for training the detector also adds robustness to the study.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe paper raises several questions about primarily the soundness of evaluation and the reliability of the proposed metric (detailed in the **Questions** section). For example, the paper limits its IRG evaluation to only one domain-specific model, XrayGPT, which is problematic given that IRG tasks are where hallucination metrics are particularly valuable. Additionally, results for XrayGPT in IRG appear inconsistent with those of Minigpt-4, which was shown to underperform in traditional metrics but achieved the highest MediHall Score among all evaluated models, calling into question the reliability of the MediHall Score. The paper could have strengthened its findings by evaluating other state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as open-source, domain-specific models like BiomedGPT or Med-Flamingo, or proprietary MLLMs like GPT-4 and Gemini Pro, to validate the metric’s robustness. Finally, the experimental design lacks a thorough investigation into the role of image inputs in tuning MediHallDetector. The study could benefit from ablation studies that assess performance with and without image inputs, especially given that the image encoder and connector taken from LLaVA are frozen during training and could have introduced extra errors due to its lack of visual understanding ability. These design choices suggest that the current benchmark version may be limited in scope and could benefit from further refinement and validation.\n\n### Questions\n\n**Construction of the benchmark:**\n1. Could you elaborate on the motivation behind designing confidence-weakening and counterfactual questions beyond the \"conventional\" questions in established test sets like SLAKE and RAD-VQA? Regarding counterfactual question generation, considering the GPT model is provided with limited information (text-only, single question with its ground-truth answer), how is the quality of GPT-generated counterfactual questions and answers ensured?\n\n2. Robust evaluation of hallucinations in open-ended IRG tasks is inherently challenging, particularly due to synonymous terms (in frameworks like ICD-10, multiple expressions might refer to the same condition). Since the ground truth for open-ended IRG scenarios in this paper derives from medical reports in MIMIC and OpenI test sets, how does the evaluation framework account for potential synonyms in model responses given the limited set of 1800 images and their reports seen by MediHallDetector?\n\n3. In using LLaVA-Med to generate GT responses for Med-VQA, why not utilize the GT already provided in the dataset, given that the questions originate from an established source? For the IRG scenario, are model-generated responses also exclusively from LLaVA-Med? If so, might this narrow distribution affect the generalizability of MediHallDetector, as it is fine-tuned specifically on LLaVA-Med responses?\n\n**Experimental Design:**\n1. How much does the image come into play in tuning the MedihallDetector model? It could be necessary to ablate w./w.o. image input, especially when you freeze the image encoder and connector during training.\n\n**Results**\n1. For medical VQA tasks (Table 1), why introduce a MediHall Score when accuracy already exists as a metric for Med-VQA? Notably, XrayGPT, with an accuracy of only 0.02, has a MediHall Score of 0.36. Could this indicate potential inflation in the MediHall Score?\n\n2. For medical IRG tasks (Table 2), the results for XrayGPT as measured by MediHallDetector seem counter-intuitive compared to Minigpt-4. In the original XrayGPT study [1], Minigpt-4 was a baseline against which improvements were demonstrated using ROUGE (Table 1 in [1]). Here, XrayGPT does outperform Minigpt-4 in all conventional metrics, but in the MediHall Score, with Minigpt-4 obtaining the highest MediHall Score among evaluated models. Could this raise concerns regarding the reliability of the MediHall Score metric?\n\n3. Could you clarify why models like BLIP2, LLaVA-Med, and RadFM do not receive MediHall Scores for medical IRG tasks? Open-ended IRG tasks are particularly significant since accuracy is already used as a metric for VQA. Presently, only XrayGPT is evaluated in IRG tasks using the proposed model and metric; incorporating additional state-of-the-art models would enhance the proposed metric's robustness. For instance, open-source domain-specific models such as BiomedGPT [2] and Med-Flamingo [3], which perform well on established tasks, or widely used proprietary MLLMs like GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini Pro could be valuable benchmarks.\n\n**Typo**\n1. In Figure 2(a), “pairs” is misspelled.\n2. Could you clarify whether XrayGPT is used in constructing the benchmark? It appears in Figure 1(b) but is not referenced in section 3.4.\n\n[1] https://aclanthology.org/2024.bionlp-1.35.pdf\n[2] https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17100\n[3] https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15189\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nn/a",

Recognizing the propensity for hallucination in large vision-language models (LVLMs) derived from foundational large-language models, the authors propose a framework aimed at improving the accuracy of hallucination assessments in critical medical applications. The contributions include Med-HallMark, a benchmark tailored for medical hallucination detection; MediHallDetector, a model for detecting hallucinations in medical contexts; and the MediHall Score, a metric designed to evaluate hallucinations of varying severity and types. Through comprehensive experiments, the authors claim that their proposed metrics and models yield improved insights compared to existing methodologies.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. The evaluation of the proposed methodology primarily relies on a single domain-specific model, XrayGPT. This limitation raises concerns regarding the robustness of the evaluation framework.\n2. Results indicate discrepancies in performance where XrayGPT's results diverge from those of Minigpt-4, suggesting potential issues with the reliability of the MediHall Score.\n3. The study lacks evaluation of additional state-of-the-art LVLMs, which could provide a more comprehensive validation of the proposed metrics.\n4. The experimental design does not sufficiently investigate the impact of image inputs on the performance of MediHallDetector, which should be addressed through further ablation studies.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- Figure 2(a) contains a typographical error; “pairs” is misspelled.\n- Clarification is needed on XrayGPT's role in constructing the benchmark, as it appears in Figure 1(b) but is not discussed in section 3.4.\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript aligns with TMI editorial criteria by highlighting a significant issue—hallucinations in medical LVLMs—making its contribution noteworthy for future clinical applications (significance). The innovation is evident in the introduction of Med-HallMark and the MediHall Score, as they provide tailored evaluation metrics for the medical domain. However, the limitations in experimental scope, particularly regarding the evaluation across various models and the role of image inputs, raise questions about reproducibility and overall robustness.\n\n### Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision is recommended to address the methodological concerns raised, specifically regarding the evaluation framework's scope and robustness.",

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript introduces a hallucination detection and evaluation benchmark tailored to the medical multimodal domain, addressing the challenge that large vision-language models (LVLMs) often inherit hallucination tendencies from general-purpose language models. The work’s main contributions include: (i) *Med-HallMark*, a benchmark for detecting medical hallucinations; (ii) *MediHallDetector*, a model for domain-specific hallucination detection; and (iii) *MediHall Score*, a novel evaluation metric differentiating hallucination severity and type. Overall, the study is well-motivated and emphasizes clinical safety, though issues in the evaluation design and reliability of results limit its soundness.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Evaluation Scope and Reliability:** The study evaluates primarily on XrayGPT, limiting the generalizability of MediHall Score and MediHallDetector. Broader benchmarking with additional state-of-the-art or domain-specific LVLMs (e.g., BiomedGPT, Med-Flamingo, GPT‑4, Gemini Pro) is necessary to validate robustness.  \n2. **Metric Consistency:** Discrepancies between conventional metrics and MediHall Score raise questions about the latter’s reliability. For instance, XrayGPT’s high MediHall Score despite low accuracy suggests possible inflation or inconsistency in metric calibration.  \n3. **Benchmark and Data Construction:** The motivation for generating “confidence-weakening” and “counterfactual” questions beyond those in established datasets (e.g., SLAKE, RAD-VQA) should be clarified, as should the quality control of GPT‑generated counterfactuals.  \n4. **Handling Synonyms in IRG Evaluation:** Since open-ended image–report generation (IRG) tasks involve synonymous or equivalent medical terms, the evaluation framework’s strategy for handling lexical variation needs to be specified.  \n5. **Experimental Design and Ablation:** The contribution of image input during MediHallDetector training is unclear. Given that the image encoder and connector are frozen, an ablation study with and without image input would clarify their role and potential limitations.  \n6. **Use of LLaVA-Med Outputs:** The rationale for using LLaVA-Med to generate ground truth responses instead of dataset-provided ones requires explanation, as dependence on a single generator may reduce generalizability.  \n7. **Incomplete Reporting:** Some models (BLIP2, LLaVA-Med, RadFM) lack MediHall Scores for IRG tasks, constraining comparative analysis.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify whether XrayGPT contributes to benchmark construction, as implied by Figure 1(b).  \n- Correct the typo in Figure 2(a) (“pairs” misspelled).  \n- Some figures and results tables could benefit from clearer cross-referencing within the text.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe topic is significant and understudied, addressing hallucination detection in medical LVLMs—a high-impact area for safety and reliability. The benchmark and metric are conceptually innovative, introducing domain-specific constructs. However, evaluation suffers from limited scope, inconsistent metric behavior, and insufficient validation across diverse models. The reproducibility of results would improve with more transparent dataset construction and ablation analyses. Overall, the paper’s novelty is balanced by methodological weaknesses that currently hinder confidence in its findings.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.** The work presents an important and timely contribution but requires broader evaluation, clearer methodological justification, and additional validation to establish soundness and reproducibility.",

What is the advantage of the proposed fine-tuned model over other baseline methods?  \n●\tThe hierarchical definition of the MediHALL score seems a bit intuitive, which is a simple evenly scaled value on 5 categories.  \n●\tThe paper lacks discussion on the relevant work that conduct similar hallucination detection in LLMs at Healthcare domain.  \n●\tIt is suggested that the paper could make further clarification on certain questions as in the Question section, if most critical concerns can be addressed, it is plausible to raise the score for the paper’s quality evaluation.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. The authors explicitly defined 5 types of hallucination levels, among which: Catastrophic Hallucination, Critical Hallucinations, Minor Hallucination are severity levels, but the attribute, prompt-induced ones is indeed the `cause` of the hallucinations. There raise doubts of the rationale of such empirical classifications including attribute, prompt-induced to severity levels. \n \n2. As in line 215, the conventional Q_{conv} questions are generated by the GPT3.5, how is the quality guaranteed? How is the initial conv question obtained?  \n \n3. LLaVA-Med was used to infer answers, what is the size of the whole dataset? Even though the authors claim that the data has been examined, how is the quality guaranteed?   \n \n4. Also, for the dataset part that is relevant to the IRG scenario, the authors use a sampling method to draw 1,800 images and their corresponding medical reports from existing datasets: MIMIC-test and OpenI datasets. This weakens the contribution towards the data as proposed in line 065.  \n \n5. In line 255, “This fine-grained metric xxx”, starts abruptly, since the previous paragraph discusses the existing metrics drawbacks. Then it directly refers to “This metric”, which is not transitioning naturally.  \n \n6. The MediHALL score is relatively simple, which is built upon the pre-categorized types of hallucination levels and assigns different values in a hierarchical way.  Based on this, the latter human-annotation and fine-tuning are conducted, are they able to maintain the objectiveness?  \n \n7. In line 318, which directs the training data details to Figure, it explicitly shows the categories, and the types of training data covered for MEDIHALLDETECTOR, but what about the amount of the data? And how is the instruction pair data derived?  \n \n8.

The paper is generally well-structured, making it accessible and understandable for readers.\n\n### Major Comments:\n1. The manuscript does not sufficiently emphasize the unique challenges associated with the healthcare domain. Most of the evaluation appears to address typical hallucination challenges present in vision-language models, raising questions about the distinctiveness and advantages of the proposed evaluation compared to existing methods.\n2.

Much of the evaluation appears transferable from general LVLM hallucination work, raising questions about the distinct advantage of this medical-focused benchmark and fine-tuned model.  \n2. **Metric Design:** The hierarchical definition of the MediHALL score appears somewhat ad hoc, based on evenly scaled categories rather than a justified empirical framework. This simplification may limit interpretability and validity.  \n3. **Related Work:** The discussion overlooks existing work in medical hallucination benchmarking (e.g., MEDHALU, MEDIC, and Faithfulness Hallucination Detection in Healthcare AI). These should be explicitly compared to clarify novelty.  \n4. **Classification Rationale:** The inclusion of “attribute” and “prompt-induced” hallucinations as severity levels seems conceptually inconsistent, as they represent causes rather than degrees of severity.  \n5. **Dataset Quality and Scope:** More details are needed on dataset size, sampling rationale, and quality control, especially for MIMIC-test and OpenI subsets. The reliance on 1,800 sampled images may reduce the dataset’s originality.  \n6. **Evaluation and Clarity Issues:** Transitions between sections (e.g., line 255) are abrupt. The explanation of training data composition and instruction pairs for MEDIHALLDETECTOR (line 318) lacks quantitative clarity.  \n7. **Quality Assurance:** The generation of conventional questions via GPT‑3.5 (line 215) requires justification regarding quality assurance and reproducibility of initial prompts.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The paper is generally clear and well written, though minor stylistic improvements could enhance flow.  \n- Ensure objective phrasing when describing annotation and fine-tuning procedures; clarify how human evaluation consistency is maintained.  \n- Minor inconsistencies in figure referencing and paragraph transitions should be addressed.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe work offers a timely attempt to formalize hallucination evaluation in medical LVLMs, an area of high significance. Its strength lies in integrating dataset, metric, and evaluator components into one framework.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses hallucination detection in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) within medical contexts by introducing three main contributions. First, Med-HallMark is presented as the first benchmark for medical multimodal hallucination detection, supporting both Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) and Imaging Report Generation (IRG) tasks with hierarchical categorization of hallucinations into five severity levels (Section 3). Second, MediHall Score is proposed as a domain-specific evaluation metric that assigns scores based on hallucination severity (Section 4). Third, MediHallDetector is developed as a specialized model for detecting medical hallucinations through supervised fine-tuning (Section 5). The benchmark encompasses 7,341 samples across conventional, confidence-weakening, counterfactual, and image depiction questions (Figure 1). Experimental results demonstrate that existing LVLMs exhibit significant hallucination rates, with the proposed MediHall Score providing more nuanced assessment compared to traditional metrics (Tables 1-2).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Insufficient mathematical rigor in metric formulation**\n  - The MediHall Score calculation lacks formal mathematical notation and precision (Section 4, lines 270-275). The averaging formula Hoverall = 1/k Σᵢ₌₁ᵏ Hᵢ oversimplifies complex hierarchical relationships between different hallucination types.\n  - Score assignments (Hc = 0.0, Hcr = 0.2, etc.) appear arbitrary without statistical justification or sensitivity analysis supporting these specific values.\n  - No confidence intervals or uncertainty quantification is provided for the proposed metric, limiting its statistical interpretability in clinical contexts.\n\n• **Limited scope and generalizability of benchmark construction**\n  - The dataset relies heavily on only four source datasets (SLAKE, VQA-RAD, MIMIC, OpenI) as stated in Section 3.4, potentially limiting diversity of medical conditions and imaging modalities.\n  - The hierarchical categorization system is developed with assistance from \"experienced clinicians\" (Section 3.3) but lacks details on inter-annotator agreement, annotation guidelines, or validation across different medical specialties.\n  - GPT-based augmentation for expanding questions (Section 3.4, lines 225-227) may introduce systematic biases that are not adequately controlled or measured.\n\n• **Inadequate experimental validation and baseline comparisons**\n  - The evaluation of MediHallDetector against GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 is limited to only 300 samples (Section 6.3), which may not provide sufficient statistical power for robust conclusions.\n  - Missing comparisons with other specialized medical hallucination detection methods, as the paper claims to be \"the first\" but does not adequately survey related work in medical AI safety.\n  - Tables 1-2 show inconsistent performance patterns across models without adequate statistical significance testing or error bars to support the claimed superiority of the proposed approach.\n\n• **Questionable clinical relevance and practical applicability**\n  - The paper lacks validation from actual clinical practitioners beyond the initial annotation phase, limiting evidence of real-world utility (no direct evidence found in the manuscript for clinical validation).\n  - The five-level hierarchical categorization system may be too complex for practical clinical implementation, as evidenced by the low consistency rates of even advanced models like GPT-4 (Figure 2b shows only 76.19% consistency).\n  - No discussion of computational costs, inference time, or scalability considerations for deployment in clinical settings where real-time performance is crucial.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical formulation and statistical rigor**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definitions with proper notation for all components of the MediHall Score, including explicit handling of edge cases and missing data scenarios.\n  - Conduct sensitivity analysis to justify the specific score assignments and demonstrate robustness to parameter variations through systematic experimentation.\n  - Include confidence intervals and statistical significance testing for all metric comparisons, with appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons.\n\n• **Expand benchmark diversity and validation methodology**\n  - Include additional medical imaging datasets from different institutions and geographical regions to improve generalizability and reduce potential dataset bias.\n  - Provide detailed inter-annotator agreement statistics (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa) and establish clear annotation protocols that can be replicated by other research groups.\n  - Replace or supplement GPT-based augmentation with human-generated questions to eliminate potential systematic biases in question formulation.\n\n• **Strengthen experimental design and comparative analysis**\n  - Expand the evaluation dataset to at least 1,000-2,000 samples with stratification across different medical conditions and hallucination types for more robust statistical analysis.\n  - Include comparisons with domain-adapted versions of existing hallucination detection methods and general-purpose fact-checking systems applied to medical contexts.\n  - Report statistical significance tests, effect sizes, and confidence intervals for all performance comparisons, with proper correction for multiple hypothesis testing.\n\n• **Validate clinical utility and practical deployment considerations**\n  - Conduct user studies with practicing radiologists and clinicians to evaluate the practical utility and interpretability of the proposed hierarchical categorization system.\n  - Simplify the categorization system based on clinical feedback, potentially reducing to 3-4 levels that align better with clinical decision-making workflows.\n  - Include comprehensive analysis of computational requirements, inference latency, and scalability metrics to demonstrate feasibility for clinical deployment scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Medical image segmentation is essential in medical diagnostics but is hindered by the scarcity of labeled three-dimensional imaging data, which requires costly expert annotations. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses this limitation by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data alongside limited labeled samples. The Mean Teacher model, a prominent SSL method, enhances performance by employing an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of the student model to form a teacher model, where the EMA decay coefficient is critical. However, using a fixed coefficient fails to adapt to the evolving training dynamics, potentially restricting the model's effectiveness. In this paper,\nwe propose Meta MeanTeacher, a novel framework that integrates meta-learning to dynamically adjust the EMA decay coefficient during training. We approach proposed Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module in our Meta MeanTeacher framework, which captures the representational capacities of both student and teacher models. DDM heuristically learns the optimal EMA decay coefficient by taking the losses of the student and teacher networks as inputs and updating it through pseudo-gradient descent on a meta-objective. This dynamic adjustment allows the teacher model to more effectively guide the student as training progresses.\nExperiments on two datasets with different modalities, i.e., CT and MRI, show that Meta MeanTeacher consistently outperforms traditional Mean Teacher methods with fixed EMA coefficients. Furthermore, integrating Meta MeanTeacher into state-of-the-art frameworks like UA-MT, AD-MT, and PMT leads to significant performance enhancements, achieving new state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe paper introduces the Meta Mean Teacher framework, a novel approach to improve semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Traditional Mean Teacher models use a fixed Exponential Moving Average (EMA) decay coefficient to update the teacher model, but this fixed value often limits model effectiveness. Meta Mean Teacher addresses this limitation by introducing a Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module that adaptively adjusts the EMA decay coefficient based on training dynamics. This dynamic adjustment optimizes the student-teacher learning process, enabling better performance in tasks with limited labeled data.\n\nKey contributions of this work include:\n\n1. Adaptive EMA Decay: The DDM module optimizes the EMA decay coefficient, enhancing the model's adaptability and enabling it to capture richer training representations.\n2. Plug-and-Play Architecture: Meta Mean Teacher is designed to integrate seamlessly into existing models, improving performance across various Mean Teacher-based methods.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. Dynamic Adaptability: By incorporating the Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM) module, the framework dynamically adjusts the EMA decay coefficient (α) during training. This adaptability ensures that the teacher model evolves effectively with the student model, allowing more precise guidance as training progresses. This approach addresses a common limitation in fixed-coefficient Mean Teacher models, which often fail to account for varying training dynamics.\n\n2. Plug-and-Play Module: The Meta Mean Teacher framework is designed as a modular system, making it highly compatible with existing models based on the Mean Teacher architecture. This modularity allows easy integration into various semi-supervised frameworks like UA-MT, AD-MT, and PMT.\n\n3. Enhanced Stability and Robustness: The framework benefits from the Mean Teacher method’s inherent stability due to EMA but improves upon it by learning an optimal decay coefficient through meta-learning techniques.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. High Computational Overhead: The adaptive EMA adjustment via DDM introduces complexity and requires more computational resources. The dynamic adjustment process, which includes cloning and iterative updates of both teacher and student models, may not be feasible for real-time or resource-limited applications, especially when processing large 3D medical imaging data.\n\n2. Limited Exploration of Other Adaptive Techniques: While the paper focuses on dynamically adjusting the EMA decay coefficient, other hyperparameters (like learning rates or loss weight factors) could also impact model performance in semi-supervised learning. The focus on only one parameter might restrict the overall optimization potential, as additional adjustments could further enhance the segmentation quality.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. On the impact of α=0.01: Why does the model show improvement when α is set to 0.01? This result seems to contradict the explanation provided in Section 3.1.\n\n2. The use of fixed α in the ablation experiments in Section 4.3: In Section 4.3, why was the average fixed α method chosen for comparison? From Figure 1, we can see that lower α values ​​(such as 0.03, 0.05, and 0.1) significantly degrade the performance. In contrast, α of 0.97 achieves performance higher than 0.84. Doesn't this general average comparison seem a bit biased?\n\n3. The impact of α greater than 0.5: From Table 1, we can see that when α is greater than 0.5, its impact on performance becomes less significant. Test whether randomly selected α values ​​greater than 0.5 are beneficial, thereby potentially improving the results?\n\n4. Suspicion about the data in Section 4.4 compared with other methods: Why is your experimental setting different from that in \"Alternative Diversified Teaching of Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation\", but most of the state-of-the-art data (including LA and Pancreas-NIH datasets) are the same as the data in that paper? Does this indicate that the data is directly borrowed?\n\n5. The m symbol in Figure 2: What does \"m\" mean in Figure 2? Is this symbol redundant?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4",

This paper introduces a strategy to adjust the EMA decay coefficient to improve semi-supervised segmentation performance, which could be a meaningful contribution to this field.\n3. The extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. I have not observed many innovative aspects in the application of meta-learning to the field of semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Part of the reason for this is the clarity of the writing; it is currently unclear what significant differences exist between the proposed DDM and previous meta-learning strategies. If there are no substantial differences, then the methodological contribution of this approach appears to be quite limited.\n2. Could the authors explain what potential drawbacks a fixed EMA decay coefficient might have on the MT framework, particularly in the context of medical image processing?\n3. The motivation is unclear. I do not understand why a dynamic change in $\\alpha$ would have a greater advantage compared to a fixed value. $\\alpha$ can be understood as the weight distribution between the teacher model’s parameters and the student model’s parameters during the iterative update process, with the teacher model’s weight being overwhelmingly dominant. I question the assumption that dynamically varying $\\alpha$ between 0.95 and 0.99 is necessarily better than a fixed value of 0.97. Could you provide a plot showing how $\\alpha$ changes dynamically over training iterations in the experiments?\n4. In Equation 2, what criteria does DDM use to derive αm? Is there a relationship between $\\alpha_m$ and these two losses? For example, if the teacher model has a lower loss, should $\\alpha_m$ be larger? Please explain.\n5. The notation in the paper is somewhat confusing. In Equation 1, what are the differences between $\\Theta_s^*$ and $\\Theta_s$, and between $\\Theta_s$ and $\\theta_s$? Additionally, what is meant by meta data $\\mathcal{D}_m$, and how does it differ from labeled data and unlabeled data? Furthermore, the $\\mathcal{L}_m$ formula is missing; I suggest adding it.\n6. What is the initial value of $\\alpha$? Has an ablation study been conducted to verify the impact of $\\alpha$?\n7. The authors mention that DDM can be promoted as a plug-and-play component for different models. However, I think DDM has limitations. For instance, how would DDM be applied to commonly used pseudo-labeling methods based on CPS (Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Cross Pseudo Supervision)?\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the weakness.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

        "text": "**Phase 1: Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript presents a methodological innovation in *semi-supervised medical image segmentation*, introducing a *meta-learned dynamic decay mechanism* for the Mean Teacher framework. The contribution squarely targets algorithmic and training methodology, relevant to TMI’s focus on methodological advances in image analysis rather than pure application studies.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe proposed *Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM)* and *Meta Mean Teacher* framework represent a conceptual and technical contribution: using meta-learning to adapt a critical hyperparameter (EMA decay) during training. While the Mean Teacher and meta-learning foundations are not new, their integration for dynamic control of the EMA coefficient is a novel idea with plausible generality. The incremental benefit (~0.5–1.5% improvement in Dice or Jaccard) is modest but consistent, demonstrating methodological value.  \n→ **Assessment:** Methodologically moderate-to-strong novelty relative to existing semi-supervised segmentation paradigms.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe experimental design includes:  \n- Comparisons on two standard 3D datasets (LA MRI, Pancreas-NIH CT).  \n- Ablation testing between fixed, teacher-guided, and student-guided DDM update strategies.  \n- Integrations into multiple Mean Teacher derivatives (UA-MT, AD-MT, PMT).  \nThe details of optimization and hyperparameters are adequately stated. However, documentation of *dataset splits*, *statistical significance of improvements*, *runtime overhead*, and *reproducibility assurances* (e.g., code sharing specifics) are limited. The theoretical justification adds conceptual clarity but remains informal—not rigorous mathematics.  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nOverall clear and fluent English with a professional structure (abstract, introduction, method, experiments). Figures and tables are informative. Minor issues: formatting glitches (e.g., subscript/superscript spacing, occasionally inconsistent symbol rendering), some sentence-level redundancy, and overlength explanations. Grammar is good but readability could be improved by tighter phrasing and clearer figure captions.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nDatasets used (LA, Pancreas-NIH) are public and anonymized. There is no mention of institutional review board (IRB) approvals or patient data handling details, but expected for public datasets. The authors *state* that code will be released upon acceptance—TMI recommends release at submission or acceptance. Reproducibility would benefit from inclusion of random seeds and precise training-validation-test partitioning.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThe paper proposes *Meta Mean Teacher*, a new semi-supervised segmentation framework combining the classical Mean Teacher approach with *Dynamic Decay Modulation (DDM)*. DDM employs a small meta-learned network that dynamically adjusts the exponential moving average (EMA) decay coefficient (α) between student and teacher models based on their respective losses. The authors introduce a “student-guided” meta-learning strategy, theoretically argue its advantage, and empirically validate it on two 3D medical image segmentation benchmarks (LA MRI and Pancreas CT). The approach serves as a plug-and-play extension to current Mean Teacher–style methods, yielding consistent but moderate performance improvements.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological scope relevant to semi-supervised medical image segmentation.  \n- Conceptually elegant integration of meta-learning for dynamic hyperparameter control.  \n- Broad validation across multiple MT-based architectures.  \n- Theoretical motivation clarifies underlying intuition.  \n- Demonstrated generality on multiple imaging modalities.  \n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Incremental gains: improvements are small relative to added complexity.  \n- Limited statistical analysis or robustness studies (no variance over multiple runs).  \n- Theoretical analysis is heuristic rather than formal proof-based.  \n- No exploration of runtime or computational burden of the DDM (an important consideration for practical adoption).  \n- Only two datasets; broader validation (other segmentation tasks or modalities) would strengthen claims.  \n- Reproducibility could be improved by earlier public code release and complete dataset split documentation.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Quantitative significance** – Provide variance/error bars or multiple runs to demonstrate robustness of improvements. Are observed gains statistically significant given stochastic training variance?  \n2. **Complexity analysis** – Report computational cost, training time overhead, and parameter count associated with DDM.  \n3. **Generalization** – Consider adding experiments on a different anatomical task or at least cross-validation between modalities to claim methodological generality.  \n4. **Clarity on meta-learning setup** – Expand explanation of meta-dataset selection: how is *Dm* separated from labeled/unlabeled data, and how does this affect data efficiency?  \n5. **Code and reproducibility** – Strongly recommend providing a GitHub repository link or detailed pseudocode, per TMI reproducibility policy.  \n6. **Theoretical exposition** – The current “function space” argument is qualitative. Strengthen with a clearer mathematical formulation or intuition figures.  \n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Fix isolated formatting errors (e.g., missing spaces in formulas and variable superscripts).  \n- In Figures 1–3, ensure high-resolution and clearer captions explaining all abbreviations.  \n- Recheck references for consistent IEEE style capitalization.  \n- Eliminate redundant sentences in Introduction (lines 056–080 overlap with Abstract).  \n- Clarify units and voxel size descriptions consistently (LA dataset section).\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision** – The work presents a promising and conceptually novel enhancement to Mean Teacher–based semi-supervised segmentation frameworks with methodological relevance for TMI. However, the manuscript needs additional experimental rigor (statistical significance, efficiency analysis) and clearer methodological exposition to reach publishable standard.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4/5  \n(High confidence in technical assessment; moderate uncertainty about expected generalization beyond tested datasets.)\n\n---\n\n**Reviewer Summary Comment to Editor**  \nThe submission introduces an interesting meta-learning–based mechanism for dynamic teacher-student consistency adaptation, fitting within TMI’s methodology scope. The idea is novel enough to warrant consideration, though improvements are numerically small and the paper lacks some reproducibility and statistical analyses expected for an IEEE TMI-level contribution. With a strong revision focusing on experimental substantiation and presentation polish, it may reach publishable quality.",

The proposed framework is designed to improve the performance of the Mean Teacher model by adapting the EMA decay coefficient based on the losses of both student and teacher models. The authors claim that their method outperforms traditional Mean Teacher approaches with fixed EMA coefficients and achieves state-of-the-art results when integrated into other semi-supervised frameworks. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for dynamic adjustment of the EMA decay coefficient is clear.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning:\n   - The introduction of the DDM module for dynamic adjustment of the EMA decay coefficient is innovative. However, the manuscript needs to provide a more thorough discussion of how this approach differs from existing works that also address the issue of adaptive hyperparameters. For example, the manuscript should clarify how the proposed method compares to recent advancements in meta-learning and adaptive hyperparameter tuning.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design:\n   - The experiments are conducted on two datasets: LA Heart and Pancreas-NIH. While these datasets cover different modalities (CT and MRI), the evaluation is somewhat limited in scope. The authors should consider expanding the validation to include additional anatomical structures and datasets to better establish the generalizability of their approach.\n   \n3. Comparisons:\n   - The manuscript compares the proposed method with several state-of-the-art frameworks, including UA-MT, AD-MT, and PMT. However, the baseline comparisons lack some recent semi-supervised segmentation methods, particularly those that employ advanced regularization techniques or novel network architectures. Including these comparisons would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed method's performance.\n   \n4. Reproducibility:\n   - The authors mention that they will release the code upon acceptance. However, the manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters used in the experiments. Providing a more complete methodology section is crucial for ensuring reproducibility.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 1 and 3 are informative but could be improved by providing clearer legends and labels. Some figures are cluttered, making it difficult to interpret the results.\n2. Notation: The notation used in the method section is sometimes inconsistent. For example, the use of `fθt` and `fθs` for the teacher and student models should be consistently defined.\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms are used without proper definitions, such as \"DDM\" and \"MT\". Defining these early in the text would improve clarity.\n4. Typographical Issues: There are minor typographical errors, such as \"k-spacce\" and \"undersampling maskes\", which should be corrected.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses the significant challenge of semi-supervised medical image segmentation by proposing a novel framework that dynamically adjusts the EMA decay coefficient. The proposed DDM module offers a promising approach to enhance the Mean Teacher framework. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation across a wider range of datasets and anatomical structures. The comparative analysis could also be strengthened by including additional recent methods. Despite these limitations, the manuscript presents a technically sound and potentially impactful contribution to the field. The reproducibility of the approach is currently insufficient due to incomplete methodological details, which should be addressed in a revised version.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand their comparative analysis to include additional recent methods, broaden their validation across multiple datasets and anatomical structures, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe paper proposes a conformal prediction based method to quantify the uncertainty for medical image segmentation. The proposed method is particularly designed for pre-trained segmentation models which notoriously make overconfident and wrong predictions. The proposed method learns thresholds using the maximum logit scores from a calibration set for the inside and outside of the ground truth masks and apply them on the logit scores of the test image to return conformalized segmentation prediction which guarantees to include the ground truth segmentation. The paper shows that naively learning the outside thresholds on max logits is not optimal and propose to transform the scores using a distance to make sure that far away pixels have lower scores. The method is validated on a single dataset for polyp segmentation and the results show that the proposed method produces conformal sets with narrower boundaries compared to using scores which are not transformed.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 1\n\n### Strengths\n\n- The idea of using transformed max logit scores is simple but quite effective strategy to produces conformal segmentation sets.\n- The presented experiments show the effectiveness of the method compared to using non-transformed logits.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1- Although I found the proposed idea of transforming max logit scores interesting, I don't think that the paper presents enough contribution to be presented in ICLR. The idea of applying conformal prediction to max logits for inside and outside of the boundaries is a direct extension of initial conformal prediction methods developed for segmentation, and applying transformations based on distance is an intuitive choice to refine predicted boundaries.\n\n2- The paper does not present any comparisons with the existing conformal prediction works for image segmentation.\n\n[1] Mossina et al. Conformal Semantic Image Segmentation: Post-hoc Quantification of Predictive Uncertainty, CVPR Workshops, 2024,\n\n3- The method is evaluated on only a single dataset. Multiple datasets should be included to make sure that the performance generalizes across datasets.\n\n4- In many segmentation tasks, we are interested in segmenting multiple structures. The paper only focuses on binary segmentation. I think the method should be validated on multi-class setting to make sure that it is also applicable in that setting.\n\n5- The explanation of how the method is applied at test time could also be clearer. As I understand it, during testing, the method applies the inner threshold on max logits to find inner boundaries, then applies a distance transformation based on each pixel’s distance from these inner boundaries, and finally applies an outer boundary threshold. However, the exact steps of the algorithm during test time need more clarification.\n\n6- In conventional uncertainty quantification algorithms for segmentation such as [2, 3] the uncertainty is quantified by the variance of the segmentation samples generated from the posterior distribution. How can the quantification be done in this case? Is it the margin between the inner and outer boundaries? Is the uncertainty quantified by the algorithm correlates with the uncertainty in the input image? For example, does the method output larger margins when there is greater disagreement between the segmentations of different experts?  \n\n[2] Kohl et al. A Probabilistic U-Net for Segmentation of Ambiguous Images\n[3] Erdil et al. MCMC Shape Sampling for Image Segmentation with Nonparametric Shape Priors\n\n7- The margin between the inner and outer boundaries appears quite large and there can be many unplausible segmentations within this area. For practical applications, an uncertainty quantification method should ideally produce a set of plausible segmentation samples within this margin, rather than simply indicating a large margin that may or may not include the ground truth segmentation. How could one obtain a plausible segmentation sample from this margin?\n\n### Questions\n\n- How does the results generalize to other datasets and segmentation of multiple structures?\n- How does the uncertainty quantified by the proposed method relates with the real uncertainty (assuming it can be measured by the disagreement between multiple experts)?\n- How one can use the proposed method in a practical application? Can we get samples of plausible segmentations within the margin outputted by the algorithm?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4",

Experiments on one public dataset  are shown (containing still images from minmally invasive surgery).\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The authors present the problem in a formal manner, relating it to existing work.  \n* The overall problem addressed is relevant.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n* The motivation for the scores functions (logit, distance, ...) is weak. The necessity to choose the type and to even mix them gives the overall approach a bit of a heuristic touch. (While I do understand that you would consider your contribution here to be in the formal derivation of underlying theory, i.e., very much the opposite of a heuristic.)\n* The experiments only provide insights into one very narrow application. they are merely fulfilling the purpose of an illustation of the problem, but not a validation.\n\n### Questions\n\n* You are testing on public data. Has your pretrained polyp segmentation algorithm been trained on the same public data? \n* Are there any susequent video frames in the dataset, or images of the same polyp / patient? If there are, did you stratify your training / testing set accordingly?  \n* Please remove the reference to tumors throughout the paper. Polyps may be precursors to tumors, but they aren't any. \n* You are using a dataset from different centers, there may be systematic differences in how the polyp areas are annotated - some annotators being more inclusive with respect to surrounding tissue, others being less. How does this variability impact on your measure? \n*  I might have missed it but what is the accuracy of your underlying segmentation algorithm? I would be under the impression that it is a well performing algorithm on a rather easy segmentation task? How does your approach relate to extrema in algorithmic performance, i.e., perfect segmentations or complete misses? \n* You are stating \"In order to make efficient use of the data available, the learning dataset can in fact contain some or all of the data used to train the image segmentor.\" Your training data may be fairly overfittet impacting on your logit score and, hence, your choice of margin (logit/distance, thresholds). Wouldn't it be a safer approach to generate cross-validated logit functions and use them in the comparison?\n* I understand that the primary contribution of this study is the theory offered. Still, you are stressing that your algorithm is a very lightweight addition to any pretrained segmentation algorithm. And there are a lot of standard computer vision / biomedical image data sets for segmentation available, as well as pretrained algorithms. Would you be able to generate segmentations maps for predefined certainty levels, and compare these levels with the testing performances across a larger set of applications? It would be quite convincing, if e.g., your 90% certainty map of the outer margin would indeed include 90% pixels of a test set or lead to a sufficiently large overlap (that has previously been defined) in 90% of all test cases.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 3\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nnone",

The experiments focus solely on a very narrow application, serving more as an illustration rather than comprehensive validation of the approach.\n3.

The manuscript makes repeated references to tumors, which should be corrected as polyps are precursors rather than tumors themselves.\n6. The variability in annotation across different centers could impact the measures; this factor requires discussion.\n7. The accuracy of the underlying segmentation algorithm needs to be stated and discussed relative to its performance extremes.\n8.

The authors propose two methods—using the CNN logit score or distance from the predicted segmentation—to define the margin.

The paper addresses a relevant problem, and the formalization is clearly related to existing literature, though the presentation and validations remain limited.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Motivation and Theoretical Coherence:** The justification for using logit or distance scores as uncertainty functions is weak. The need to manually select or even combine these adds a heuristic quality that contradicts the paper’s claim of formal rigor.  \n2. **Experimental Breadth and Validation:** The evaluation is restricted to a narrow dataset and mostly serves an illustrative purpose rather than a validation demonstrating generality or robustness.  \n3. **Training Protocol Clarifications:** It is unclear whether the pretrained polyp segmentation algorithm was trained on the same public data used for testing. Additional information about sample stratification is needed, particularly regarding possible overlap of frames or patients.  \n4. **Dataset and Annotation Variability:** The dataset originates from multiple centers. Differences in annotation style could systematically affect uncertainty estimates; the manuscript should address this potential bias.  \n5. **Base Model Performance:** The accuracy of the underlying segmentation model is unspecified. Clarifying this is necessary to interpret the proposed uncertainty margins, especially for extreme cases of very good or poor segmentation.  \n6. **Overfitting and Validation Strategy:** The suggestion to use cross-validated logits instead of potentially overfitted ones should be considered to ensure unbiased margin derivation.  \n7. **Generalizability of Approach:** Extending the experiments to additional standard datasets could strengthen the claims, e.g., validating whether a nominal 90% certainty margin corresponds to desired coverage across different tasks.  \n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Remove references to “tumors,” as polyps are not tumors.  \n- Clarify whether sequential frames or repeated samples occur in the dataset.  \n- Ensure consistent terminology and fix minor typographical errors.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe work is conceptually relevant and formalizes a practical uncertainty estimation framework.

It develops a new mathematical and statistical framework for constructing spatial **conformal confidence sets** for image segmentation outputs, with theoretical coverage guarantees. This relates directly to quantitative imaging analysis and statistical image inference, fitting well within the IEEE TMI scope.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe central novelty is the *adaptation of conformal inference* to generate *spatially aware uncertainty regions* for segmentation masks, including:\n- Use of image‑level exchangeability to obtain rigorous finite‑sample guarantees.\n- Derivation of inner and outer confidence sets with probabilistic coverage of the full segmentation mask, not just pixelwise or FDR‑controlled uncertainty.\n- Introduction of *learned score transformations* (notably the distance transformation) to improve the geometric tightness of the sets.\n- Theoretical results (Theorems 2.1–2.8) linking coverage control to Hausdorff distance and bounding‑box formulations.  \nThis is a meaningful methodological advance beyond prior “pixelwise conformal” or “risk‑controlled” approaches.  \n\n3. **Technical & Experimental Rigor**  \nTheory is formally developed with proofs, assumptions stated, and multiple validation studies on independent datasets (polyps, brain, teeth).

Summary**  \nThe authors propose a general framework for constructing conformal confidence sets that provide spatially resolved uncertainty guarantees for biomedical image segmentation. Instead of pixel‑level conformal p‑values, the method calibrates thresholds based on maxima of transformed logit scores within and outside ground‑truth masks. Distance‑based and other transformations can be learned on an auxiliary dataset to produce tight outer and inner bounds. Theoretical coverage results are proven under exchangeability. Experiments on colon‑polyp, brain‑mask, and dental CT segmentations validate finite‑sample coverage and show practical utility for uncertainty quantification.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Strong theoretical grounding with well‑defined probabilistic guarantees.  \n- Novel extension of conformal inference to spatial segmentation masks.  \n- Demonstrated generality across different imaging modalities and neural‑network backbones.  \n- Practical insights on transformation learning (e.g., distance transform) that markedly improve confidence‑set precision.  \n- Clear link to clinical uncertainty needs and easy computational implementation.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Some derivations assume ideal exchangeability and independence between segmenter and calibration data; discussion of violations (e.g., domain shift) is brief.  \n- Evaluation focuses mainly on qualitative visualizations and coverage‑rate plots; limited quantitative metrics on set tightness versus segmentation accuracy.  \n- The method’s scalability to 3‑D volumetric data is not fully evaluated.  \n- Writing densely mathematical; minor editing needed for accessibility to broader TMI readership.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Exchangeability and Independence** – elaborate on how violations (e.g., correlated calibration/test subjects, retraining same network) might affect validity, and potential remedies (weighted conformal, domain adaptation).  \n2. **3‑D and Computational Cost** – extend discussion/experiments to full volumetric data efficiency to demonstrate feasibility for standard medical‑image sizes.  \n3. **Quantitative Evaluation of Efficiency** – include standardized metrics (Dice of inner/outer bounds, average Hausdorff width) to better quantify practical informativeness.  \n4. **Transformation Learning Strategy** – clarify selection criteria, hyperparameters, and avoid any circularity when limited data are available.  \n5. **Potential Clinical Integration** – briefly discuss how these spatial uncertainty bounds could be used in downstream decision‑making or uncertainty visualization interfaces.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct small typographical and spacing errors (e.g., “polyps colonscopy,” “acheived”).  \n- Improve figure captions to be self‑contained.  \n- Consolidate repetitive references to sections/appendices for conciseness.  \n- Ensure consistent notation for α₁, α₂ across figures and text.\n\n**6.

The authors adapt split-conformal inference by computing thresholds on calibration data based on the distribution of maximum transformed logit scores within and outside ground truth masks.

Key theoretical contributions include marginal coverage results (Theorems 2.1-2.2), joint coverage guarantees (Theorem 2.6), and analysis of distance transformations showing improved performance when segmentation models are accurate (Theorem 2.8). The approach is validated on three biomedical datasets: polyp colonoscopy (Section 3), brain imaging (Section 4), and teeth segmentation (Section 5), demonstrating that distance transformations of predicted masks provide tighter outer confidence sets compared to raw logit scores.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical notation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - The notation switches between M̂(X) and Mˆ(X) for predicted masks without explanation (pages 2-3)\n  - Definition of sign(A,v) in distance transformation (page 5, line 252) could be clearer about boundary cases\n  - The relationship between score function s and predicted mask M̂(X) is stated as assumed but never formally defined (page 2, lines 108-109)\n\n• **Limited theoretical analysis of score transformation optimality**\n  - No theoretical guidance provided for selecting optimal transformations beyond distance transforms (Section 2.4)\n  - Theorem 2.8 only covers distance transformations but applications use other methods like smoothing (Section 5, teeth segmentation)\n  - The learning dataset approach lacks theoretical justification for when including training data is appropriate (pages 4-5, lines 216-228)\n\n• **Experimental validation limitations**\n  - Small dataset sizes limit generalizability, particularly brain imaging (524 subjects, Section 4) and teeth (598 subjects, Section 5)\n  - No comparison with existing conformal methods for image segmentation beyond brief mention of Angelopoulos et al.

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces a methodology for constructing conformal confidence sets for the output of black-box image segmentation models, ensuring spatial uncertainty guarantees. The authors adapt conformal inference techniques to the imaging context by leveraging score transformations, particularly distance transformations, to generate tight inner and outer confidence sets for the segmented masks. The work is illustrated and validated on datasets from polyps colonoscopy, brain imaging, and teeth segmentation, demonstrating the utility of the proposed approach in providing meaningful spatial uncertainty bounds.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the manuscript presents a novel approach to constructing conformal confidence sets for image segmentation, it is essential to clarify how this work distinguishes itself from existing literature on conformal inference and risk control. The authors should explicitly discuss the contributions of recent works on conformal prediction and risk control (e.g., Bates et al., 2021; Angelopoulos et al., 2021) and how their proposed method offers improvements or alternatives.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted on three specific datasets: polyps colonoscopy, brain imaging, and teeth segmentation. Although these datasets provide a diverse set of applications, the manuscript should consider broader validation across different types of imaging data to strengthen the generalizability claim. Additionally, the manuscript should explore the performance of the method under varying conditions, such as different levels of noise or varying image resolutions.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares the proposed method with baseline approaches using logit scores and bounding box transformations. However, it would be beneficial to include comparisons with more advanced baselines, such as other score transformations or conformal inference methods specifically designed for image segmentation. This would help to establish the relative performance and advantages of the proposed approach.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript states that code will be released, but it lacks detailed descriptions of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and hyperparameters used for the image segmentation models and the conformal inference procedures. Providing a more comprehensive description of these aspects is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility of the results.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Some figures are cluttered and could benefit from a clearer presentation. For example, Figure 2 could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions to highlight the differences between the score transformations more effectively.\n\n2. Notation: The notation used in Section 2.1 is inconsistent, particularly regarding the forward operator. Clarifying and standardizing this notation would improve the readability of the manuscript.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition, which can be confusing for readers. Providing a list of acronyms or defining them upon first use would enhance clarity.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: There are typographical issues throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). Carefully proofreading the document would eliminate these errors.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in biomedical imaging: providing reliable uncertainty quantification for image segmentation models. The proposed method of adapting conformal inference through score transformations, especially distance transformations, offers a promising approach to generating meaningful spatial uncertainty bounds. The theoretical foundations are sound, and the empirical validation on multiple datasets demonstrates the practical utility of the method. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by broader validation across different imaging modalities and varying conditions. The reproducibility of the approach is compromised by the lack of detailed methodological descriptions, which should be addressed to facilitate independent replication. Overall, the manuscript has substantial merit and meets many of the standards for publication in TMI, but it requires further refinement in terms of comparative analysis and reproducibility.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include more advanced baselines, strengthen validation across different imaging datasets and conditions, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

However, current generative methods exhibit a notable gap in clinical metrics when compared to medical image classification. Recently, leveraging diagnostic results to improve report quality has emerged as a promising approach. We are curious whether training a classifier that encompasses all possible long-tailed and rare diseases could enhance the robustness of reports. To investigate this question, this study designs an evaluation framework that integrates long-tail scenarios and summarizes potential combinations of LLM-based report generation models. We assess the impact of classification on report quality across four benchmarks. Initially, we introduce LLM-based language and clinical metrics and develop a pipeline to evaluate the model's performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution (OOD) long-tail scenarios. Subsequently, we conduct a systematic evaluation of all potential model combinations. Our findings reveal that: 1) the impact of classification on report quality is positively correlated with the performance of classifiers, but the gap still exists, and 2) while classification can enhance report quality in in-domain long-tail scenarios, its benefits for OOD scenarios are limited.",

The authors investigate whether training a classifier that encompasses all possible long-tailed and rare diseases could enhance the robustness of reports. Key findings show that classification helps improve report quality in in-distribution settings but exhibits limited benefits in OOD scenarios.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper evaluates whether classification models can help improve the quality of radiology reports. This is a novel and interesting insight, with potential for aiding in real-world clinical workflows.\n2. The authors perform extensive evaluations across different strategies for incorporating classification information as well as in-domain vs. OOD settings. \n3. The authors also introduce novel LLM-based metrics for assessing the quality of radiology reports, which evaluate how well reports capture long-tail observations. This metric is an interesting contribution and has potential for aiding future works in the domain of radiology report generation.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe key weakness of this paper is inadequate evaluations, as discussed below.\n\n1. **Inadequate evaluations of classifier:** The incorporation of the classifier is inadequately evaluated, making it difficult to understand the settings in which incorporating a classifier is useful, as detailed below. The paper could have benefitted from more nuanced insights on when including the classifier helps vs. detracts from the quality of generated reports.\n\n    a. **Classifier Performance:** Although the incorporation of the classifier is the key contribution of this paper, the authors do not provide any evaluations on the quality of the actual classifier. What conditions does the classifier perform well on and which conditions does the classifier perform worse on? Does this correlate with report generation performance on the subset of images with particular conditions when the classifier is included? Does improving the performance of the classifier improve report generation quality? In OOD settings, the evaluated classifier displays poor performance  (12.0-14.0 F1 points), and as a result, it is not surprising that incorporating the classifier will not result in benefits to the RRG model in OOD settings; does this result change if the classifier is instead trained on the PadChest or IU X-ray datasets? All of these questions are critical for understanding when/how classification helps in RRG, but none of these are evaluated.\n\n    b. **Upper Bound:** It would be useful to establish an upper bound on performance of the report generation model by utilizing an “oracle” classifier (i.e. a hypothetical classifier that predicts every condition correctly). This would establish whether classification, in the optimal setting, makes useful contributions to the report generation task. As of now, the evaluations are limited by the poor performance of the evaluated classifier, and the key findings/takeaways from the paper are based on this specific classifier.\n\n2. **Inadequate evaluations of proposed metrics:** Although several new metrics are presented as key contributions of this paper, the quality of these metrics is not evaluated. How accurate is the OpenAI GPT-4o model at extracting disease categories? Did the authors check for false negatives / positives in this extraction procedure? Does this metric align with ground-truth labels for the conditions where labels are provided? Evaluating the quality of the metrics via a dataset like ReXVal would have been useful [1].\n\n[1] https://physionet.org/content/rexval-dataset/1.0.0/\n\n### Questions\n\nMy questions are detailed above in the weaknesses section.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

Key questions remain unanswered: under which conditions does the classifier perform well or poorly? How does this relate to report generation outcomes? In the out‑of‑distribution (OOD) setting, the classifier performs poorly (12–14 F1 points), which likely explains the lack of improvement when incorporated into the RRG model.

The authors propose a comprehensive evaluation framework with novel LLM-based metrics and conduct experiments across multiple benchmarks, concluding that classification aids in in-domain accuracy but may introduce errors in OOD cases due to model biases.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe study tackles a critical challenge in medical AI—how to generate reliable and clinically relevant radiology reports that generalize well across diverse clinical scenarios. By showing that classification models can enhance in-domain performance while introducing potential errors in OOD settings, this paper offers valuable insights into the limitations and trade-offs of using classification-aided generation models. The paper is well-structured, with each section building logically upon the previous one. The problem formulation, methodology, and experimental setup are clearly articulated, enhancing accessibility for readers. The experimental design is thorough, incorporating multiple benchmarks and a diverse set of evaluation metrics, including novel LLM-based metrics, to assess model performance across both in-domain and OOD settings. The rigorous use of benchmarks and detailed comparisons with existing methods underscore the study's robustness and the reliability of its findings.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nThe primary weakness of this work lies in its motivation, or key argument, which has already been discussed in a prior publication that is not referenced in this submission. The previous study, Medical Report Generation Is A Multi-label Classification Problem (Fan et al., IEEE MedAI 2024), introduces a similar concept: that classification accuracy significantly impacts the quality of medical report generation. Both works share the same foundational idea, though they differ in specific model designs and classification categories. From a performance perspective, the previous work, which uses a cross-attention approach, demonstrates better outcomes and introduces the concept of ceiling performance. This concept suggests that the theoretical upper bound for this approach would be achieved if all ground-truth labels were provided to the model, given that real-world classifiers cannot reach 100% accuracy. \n\nWhile this submission’s strength lies in its extensive experiments, broader metrics, and a variety of models, its core insights are similar to the prior work, without addressing ceiling performance or providing a comparison to it. Additionally, the reason why the 28 classification categories used in the previous study outperform disease-based categories is not examined here. These points, along with further experimental and discussion-based additions, would significantly enhance the paper.\n\n### Questions\n\nplease read the weakness part.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

The paper introduces a novel evaluation framework with large language model (LLM)-based metrics and conducts experiments across several benchmarks. Overall, the manuscript is clearly organized, methodologically sound, and offers a detailed empirical analysis.\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Overlap with Prior Work:** The main conceptual contribution—framing medical report generation as a classification-based problem—has been presented previously (Fan et al., IEEE MedAI 2024). The current study does not cite or contrast itself with that work, despite addressing a similar premise.  \n2. **Novelty and Positioning:** Because the earlier publication already demonstrated the relationship between classification accuracy and report quality, the novelty here lies primarily in the empirical scope rather than conceptual innovation. The authors should explicitly acknowledge and differentiate their approach, clearly outlining advances beyond prior findings.  \n3. **Missing Comparison to Ceiling Performance:** The related work introduced the notion of ceiling performance (upper bound given perfect classification). This submission does not adopt or analyze that concept, leaving unclear how the proposed method positions itself relative to theoretical limits.  \n4. **Category Design and Analysis:** The paper uses disease-based classification categories but does not investigate why prior label‑set designs with 28 classification categories achieved better performance.

However, the limited novelty and absence of direct comparisons to prior established frameworks reduce its overall impact.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Recommendation:** Major Revision.  \nSubstantial clarification of novelty, inclusion of comparisons to related work, and deeper analysis of category selection and theoretical performance bounds are required before the paper can be considered for acceptance.",

Many research focuses on  LLM-based report generation models, which is an important task for the medical AI domain, the question this paper investigated may provide some useful information for future research.  \n2. The research comprehensively evaluates different architectural combinations (vision encoders, classifiers, and LLMs) across multiple diverse datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT, PadChest, and IU X-Ray).\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The comparison between the four baseline models lacks analysis. The metrics give inconsistent results, how could the author get the results that C+V+LLM is better than V+LLM, and the comparison between Refining and C+V+LLM, giving statistical significance analysis of the results would be helpful.\n\n2. The poor performance of the 'Expanding' approach may be due to the prompt rather than inherent limitations.  I do not find details about the prompts used (apologize if I overlooked them). The 'Expanding' prompt should include standard medical report templates to prove a fair comparison.\n\n3. The classifier only provides binary disease presence information without crucial details like location and severity. This limitation makes hallucinations in LLM-generated reports inevitable when using classification-only inputs. Instead of comparing with these inherently limited training-free approaches, the paper would be more valuable if it explored different variants of end-to-end Vision + LLM full training. \n\n4. The paper's title 'Is classification all you need for radiology report generation?' raises a clear question, but fails to provide the answer. While the findings show that classification helps with in-domain cases but struggles with OOD scenarios, the paper leaves crucial questions unanswered: Is better classification the solution? Or should we focus on pursuing end-to-end training approaches? If the answer is ' we need better classification models', then everyone knows it.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

It introduces new benchmark design, evaluation metrics, and architectural design space analysis for *automatic radiology report generation (ARRG)* — a problem at the intersection of multimodal learning and medical imaging. Although it couples vision-language modeling with NLP, the study is anchored in imaging methodology (classifier–encoder–LLM integration, long-tail robustness, and clinically oriented metrics), making it relevant to TMI’s focus on imaging informatics and quantitative analysis.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level** –  \n   The novelty lies primarily in an **evaluation and analysis framework** rather than a fundamentally new model. Contributions include:  \n   - An **LLM-based evaluation framework** combining traditional and “clinical” metrics with LLM-derived metrics for nuanced assessment.  \n   - A **systematic exploration of model design space** (vision encoder, classifier, LLM) and training paradigms (end-to-end, refining, expanding).  \n   - Empirical findings on the limited benefit of classifiers for out-of-distribution long-tail radiology data.  \n   While conceptually interesting, much of the architecture and methodology (Swin, DINO, Vicuna, Llama-based modules) build on existing components. Hence, the innovation is more **empirical and benchmarking-oriented** than algorithmic.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor** –  \n   - The experiments are thorough: multiple datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT, PadChest, IU X-Ray), carefully separated in-domain vs. OOD testing, and use of robust baselines.  \n   - Metrics and ablation studies are exhaustively detailed, with appropriate reporting of macro/micro F1, BLEU/ROUGE, and LLM-based metrics.  \n   - However, **quantitative uncertainty or statistical significance** testing is not reported, and many analyses rely on heuristic interpretation of observed trends.  \n   - Some aspects (e.g., use of GPT-4-based evaluation) introduce subjectivity and reproducibility concerns, since API-based results can vary.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation** –  \n   - The manuscript is generally clear and well-structured, though lengthy with some redundancy across sections.  \n   - Figures and tables are informative but dense; Figure 1 and the multi-page tables may require reformatting for journal readability.  \n   - Minor grammar and phrasing issues appear but do not hinder comprehension.  \n   - Equation-level or theoretical formulations are minimal; the work is largely experimental.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance** –  \n   - The authors explicitly use **public datasets** (MIMIC-CXR, PadChest, IU X-Ray) with proper citations.  \n   - All datasets are de-identified; ethical compliance appears adequate.  \n   - Code availability is not explicitly stated—reproducibility could be strengthened by releasing model code, prompt templates, and evaluation scripts, especially for LLM-based scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \n   The manuscript investigates whether improved image classification performance translates into higher-quality radiology report generation. The authors propose a comprehensive **benchmark and evaluation framework** that tests multiple combinations of vision encoders, classifiers, and large language models (LLMs). They introduce **two LLM-based evaluation metrics** addressing the shortcomings of traditional language and clinical metrics. Through experiments on four datasets (in-domain and OOD, long-tail distributions), the study concludes that while classification outputs can improve report quality for common in-domain cases, their benefits do not generalize to out-of-distribution long-tail pathologies, sometimes even degrading performance.\n\n2. **Strengths**  \n   - Timely topic addressing the **integration of large language models in medical imaging**.  \n   - Systematic exploration and well-structured benchmark that could serve the community.  \n   - Insightful empirical observation clarifying the limited utility of diagnostic classifiers for OOD generation.  \n   - Introduction of LLM-based metrics that qualitatively enhance the evaluation of generated clinical text.  \n   - Extensive ablation and dataset diversity improve credibility of trends.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**  \n   - Limited *methodological novelty*: the framework largely reuses established architectures and metrics, with limited theoretical advancement.  \n   - Reproducibility depends heavily on proprietary LLM APIs (GPT‑4), reducing accessibility.  \n   - Lacks formal statistical analysis or uncertainty quantification for comparative results.  \n   - Discussion of the *mechanistic reasons* for classification–generation gaps remains descriptive; no modeling insight or mathematical analysis is provided.  \n   - Some contextual framing (e.g., clinical interpretability, alignment with diagnostic reasoning) could be expanded to emphasize imaging science impact.\n\n4. **Major Comments**  \n   1. Clarify the **novelty boundary**: is this primarily an evaluation paper or a modeling contribution? The abstract and title may overstate methodological innovation relative to the actual scope.  \n   2. Strengthen **methodological rationale** for new LLM-based metrics—describe how they are validated against expert judgment or inter-rater consistency.  \n   3. Discuss **statistical significance and variability** in reported results; include confidence intervals or standard deviations where possible.  \n   4. Provide **code and pipeline availability** for LLM-based evaluation; otherwise, the benchmark cannot be adopted or verified.  \n   5.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper investigates whether incorporating classification information can improve the robustness of automatic radiology report generation (ARRG), particularly for long-tail and out-of-distribution scenarios. The authors design an evaluation framework that combines LLM-based report generation models with diagnostic classifiers, proposing four baseline architectures: vision+LLM, classifier+vision+LLM, expanding, and refining approaches (Figure 1). They introduce LLM-based evaluation metrics including LLM-RadJudge and Long-tailed & OOD F1 scores to assess performance beyond conventional language and clinical metrics (Section 2.3.2). Experiments across four datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CXR-LT, PadChest, IU X-Ray) reveal that while classification information improves report quality in in-domain scenarios, it provides limited benefits for out-of-distribution long-tail cases when using powerful foundation models like Llama 3.1 70B and GPT-4 (Tables 2, 4, 5).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Insufficient Mathematical Rigor in Model Formulation**\n  - The paper lacks formal mathematical definitions for the core components (vision encoder, classifier, LLM integration) described in Section 2.2, making it difficult to assess technical soundness\n  - No explicit loss functions or optimization objectives are provided for the different training paradigms (end-to-end vs. training-free), which is critical for reproducibility\n  - The connector architecture is only briefly mentioned as \"multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with GELU activations\" (Section 2.1) without mathematical specifications\n\n• **Limited Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis**\n  - Tables 1-2 show results without confidence intervals, standard deviations, or significance tests, undermining the reliability of claimed improvements\n  - The choice of 100 and 200 long-tail categories for classifier training (Table 2) appears arbitrary with no justification or ablation study\n  - Case studies are limited to individual examples (Figure 3, Figure 5) without systematic analysis across the test sets\n\n• **Questionable Evaluation Framework Validity**\n  - The LLM-based metrics (LLM-RadJudge, Long-tailed & OOD F1) rely on GPT-4o for ground truth extraction (Section 2.3.2), introducing potential bias and circularity in evaluation\n  - The paper acknowledges that \"varying granularity in observation names across datasets requires semantic transformation\" but doesn't address how this affects metric reliability\n  - No validation of the proposed metrics against radiologist assessments or existing clinical standards\n\n• **Unclear Methodology and Reproducibility Issues**\n  - The data preprocessing pipeline lacks detail, particularly for the OOD datasets where Spanish reports are translated to English using GPT-4 (Section 2.3.1)\n  - Implementation details are relegated to the appendix with insufficient description of hyperparameter selection and model training procedures\n  - The \"refining\" approach methodology is not clearly explained in the main text, making it difficult to understand how classification information is integrated\n\n• **Weak Analysis of Core Research Question**\n  - The title question \"Is classification all you need?\" is not systematically addressed through controlled experiments isolating classification effects\n  - The paper conflates multiple variables (model architecture, training paradigm, dataset domain) making it difficult to attribute performance differences to classification integration\n  - Finding 2 states limitations for OOD scenarios but doesn't provide sufficient analysis of why this occurs or potential solutions\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance Mathematical Formulation and Technical Clarity**\n  - Provide formal mathematical definitions for each model component including input/output dimensions and transformation functions\n  - Specify explicit loss functions and optimization objectives for each training paradigm with proper mathematical notation\n  - Include detailed architectural specifications for the connector and classification integration mechanisms\n\n• **Strengthen Experimental Rigor and Statistical Validation**\n  - Report confidence intervals and conduct statistical significance tests for all performance comparisons across tables\n  - Provide systematic ablation studies justifying the choice of long-tail category numbers and other key hyperparameters\n  - Expand case studies to include quantitative analysis across larger sample sets rather than cherry-picked examples\n\n• **Validate and Improve Evaluation Framework**\n  - Validate LLM-based metrics against expert radiologist evaluations to establish reliability and remove potential circular reasoning\n  - Address the acknowledged issues with cross-dataset observation granularity through systematic semantic alignment studies\n  - Include traditional clinical validation metrics alongside the proposed LLM-based approaches\n\n• **Clarify Methodology and Ensure Reproducibility**\n  - Move essential implementation details from appendix to main text and provide comprehensive hyperparameter justification\n  - Describe the data preprocessing pipeline in detail, particularly for cross-lingual translation and its potential impact on results\n  - Provide clear algorithmic descriptions of the \"refining\" approach and other training-free methods\n\n• **Systematically Address the Core Research Question**\n  - Design controlled experiments that isolate the effect of classification information while holding other variables constant\n  - Provide deeper analysis of why classification helps in-domain but fails for OOD scenarios, potentially through attention visualization or ablation studies\n  - Restructure the paper to more directly answer the title question with clear experimental evidence and theoretical justification",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript investigates the impact of integrating a comprehensive classifier into LLM-based radiology report generation models to improve their robustness, particularly in long-tail and out-of-distribution scenarios. The authors propose a systematic evaluation framework that assesses the model's performance across four benchmarks, using both conventional and LLM-based metrics. Their findings suggest that while classifier integration improves report quality in in-domain scenarios, it may exacerbate errors in long-tail and out-of-distribution settings. The paper is well-written and provides a thorough analysis of the interaction between classification and report generation.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Scope of Evaluation: The evaluation is extensive, covering multiple datasets and scenarios. However, the reliance on a limited set of long-tail and out-of-distribution datasets might not fully generalize the findings to a wider range of clinical environments. Additional validation on more diverse datasets would strengthen the conclusions.\n\n2. Impact of Classifier in OOD Scenarios: The findings that classifier integration can worsen performance in OOD scenarios highlight a significant limitation. The authors should explore potential reasons for this behavior, such as biases in the training data or limitations of the classifier in handling unseen distributions. Further investigation into mitigating these effects could be valuable.\n\n3. Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods: While the manuscript compares with several state-of-the-art methods, it lacks a direct comparison with the most recent advancements in the field. Including more recent works would provide a clearer picture of the proposed method's standing.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript mentions that code will be released, but the details provided about training protocols, preprocessing, and hyperparameters are insufficient. Providing a more comprehensive description of the experimental setup is crucial for reproducibility.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 3 and 5 are cluttered and could benefit from simplification, such as showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions for clarity.\n\n2. Notation and Terminology: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is inconsistent and could be clarified. Definitions for acronyms such as \"R=4\" should be provided.\n\n3. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical issues, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7), should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in radiology report generation by investigating the impact of classifier integration into LLM-based models. The proposed framework and findings contribute meaningfully to the understanding of how classification can influence report quality. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited by the scope of datasets used, and the observed deterioration in OOD scenarios needs further exploration. The reproducibility of the approach is currently lacking due to incomplete methodological details. While the work is promising, it requires additional validation and clarification to fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision: The authors should expand their comparative analysis, strengthen validation across a broader range of datasets, and provide more complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "The persistent challenge of medical image synthesis posed by the scarcity of annotated data and the need to synthesize \"missing modalities\" for multi-modal analysis, underscored the imperative development of effective synthesis methods. Recently, the combination of Low-Rank Adaptation (*LoRA*) with latent diffusion models (LDMs) has emerged as a viable approach for efficiently adapting pre-trained large language models, in the medical field. However, the direct application of *LoRA* assumes uniform ranking across all linear layers, overlooking the significance of different weight matrices, and leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Prior works on *LoRA* prioritize the reduction of trainable parameters, and there exists an opportunity to further tailor this adaptation process to the intricate demands of medical image synthesis. In response, we present *SeLoRA*, a Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation module, that dynamically expands its ranking across layers during training, strategically placing additional ranks on crucial layers, to allow the model to elevate synthesis quality where it matters most. Our analysis shows that *SeLoRA* strikes the best balance between synthesis quality and training efficiency. The proposed method not only enables LDMs to fine-tune on medical data efficiently but also empowers the model to achieve improved image quality with minimal ranking. The code of our *SeLoRA* method is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SeLoRA-980D.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a new parameter-efficient fine-tuning method SeLoRA (Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation) for adapting Stable Diffusion to generate chest x-ray images. The main contribution of the paper lies in dynamically expanding the rank of LoRA during the training process, allowing it to adapt the rank according to the importance of different layers and thereby improving the quality of the synthesized images. The novelty of this approach is in using Fisher Information to guide the rank expansion, avoiding the limitations of the traditional LoRA method, which uses a \"uniform rank,\" especially when dealing with models (like Stable Diffusion) that have diverse weight matrix shapes. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of SeLoRA on two chest x-ray datasets and provides detailed comparative experiments with other LoRA variants.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. \nThe papers proposes SeLoRA, a dynamic rank-expanding method using Fisher Information to guide rank expansion during fine-tuning large models with LoRA.

As a paper focusing on adaptive parameter efficient fine-tuning methods, the paper utilizes LoRA to adapt Stable Diffusion for Chest X-ray synthesis, limiting its technical contribution. For a paper dedicated to adapting foundation model like Stable Diffusion for Chest X-ray (medical image) synthesis, the exploration is also limited and does not compare with previous work (e.g. Chambon et al., 2022a;b). Through visual comparison with image displays in Chambon et al., 2022a;b, the proposed method seems at a disadvantage.\n2.\nExperiments are conducted on relatively small datasets. Large image-report paired Chest X-ray datasets exist (e.g. MIMIC-CXR). Is this because of the heavy burden of large model like Stable Diffusion, or may be also related to the proposed method? Can the authors provide training time comparisons between SeLoRA and the compared methods? Also, as the test set of IU X-RAY and Montgomery County CXR dataset has only contains 100~200 images, the validation of the effectiveness of the method is weak.\n3.\nEvaluation and explanation are insufficient. Using a CLIP model trained purely on natural images and a maximum text token length of 76 to compute CLIP-score may not faithfully reflect how good the text-image alignment is for Chest x-ray images.\nThe training/validation/testing split is strange, could the author explain why the test set only contain 4% of the data? Are Table 1 values computed with valid data or test data? This is unclear. The paper also lacks in-depth discussion of the distribution of final rank (Figure 4,5,6) and why other LoRA methods fail on Montgomery county CXR data (Figure7). How accurate can the model generate an image given the disease or abnormal findings in the text prompt? This may be revealed using pretrained Chest X-ray classification models or manually inspect a small subset of generated results.\n\nOther non-important issues:\n4.\nthe paper title is about \"medical image syntheis”; but it only focuses on chest x-ray image.\n5.\nThe formula derivation in section3.3 is unclear.\n6.\nThe Stable Diffusion model is trained to generate a resolution of 512x512, using a resolution of 224x224 may limit the performance.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease answer the questions mentioned in the above 'weakness' section.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

The primary innovation lies in the dynamic expansion of the rank of LoRA during training, guided by Fisher Information, which enhances the model's ability to generate high-quality images. The paper claims to outperform traditional LoRA methods that utilize a uniform rank, particularly in the context of models with diverse weight matrix shapes. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of SeLoRA through experiments on two datasets, alongside a detailed comparison with existing LoRA variants.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. The contribution of the paper is unclear. While it aims to adapt Stable Diffusion for chest X-ray synthesis using LoRA, it lacks depth in exploration and comparison with previous works (e.g., Chambon et al., 2022a; 2022b), where the proposed method appears less effective based on visual evaluations.\n2. The experiments utilize relatively small datasets, raising questions about the implications on model performance. Larger datasets like MIMIC-CXR could be investigated. A comparison of training times between SeLoRA and alternative methods is warranted. The test sets from IU X-RAY and Montgomery County datasets, containing only 100-200 images, weaken the validation of the findings.\n3. Evaluation criteria and rationale need strengthening. Utilizing a CLIP model trained exclusively on natural images and with a fixed text token length of 76 for score computation may not accurately reflect text-image alignment effectiveness for chest X-ray images. Clarification on the unusual training/validation/testing splits is needed, particularly why the test set represents only 4% of the data. Furthermore, it's unclear whether Table 1 values were drawn from validation or test data. More detailed discussions on rank distribution (Figures 4, 5, 6) and the performance of other LoRA methods on the Montgomery County dataset (Figure 7) would enhance transparency. Lastly, insights on how accurately the model can generate images based on disease descriptions in prompts should be explored.\n\n### Minor Comments\n1. The title suggests a focus on \"medical image synthesis,\" yet concentrates solely on chest X-ray images.\n2. The formula derivation in Section 3.3 could be more clearly articulated.\n3. The original Stable Diffusion model targets a resolution of 512x512; using 224x224 may hinder performance.\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nThis study addresses significant issues in medical image generation, presenting a potentially innovative but somewhat narrowly focused approach. While the novelty of the rank expansion tied to Fisher Information is commendable, the contributions appear limited by inadequate comparisons and the use of small datasets. Evaluation methodologies require enhancement to establish robustness and reproducibility, especially in assessing the generated image alignments with respect to the medical application. Overall, while the manuscript demonstrates value in its proposed method, the gaps in evaluation and context necessitate further work.\n\n### Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision.",

While it proposes an adaptive LoRA method, the technical advance beyond existing LoRA-based fine-tuning approaches is modest. Furthermore, its application is limited to Stable Diffusion-based chest X-ray synthesis, with little exploration beyond this narrow setting. Comparisons with prior related works (e.g., Chambon et al., 2022a,b) are missing, and qualitative inspection suggests the proposed method may be at a disadvantage relative to these baselines.  \n2. **Experimental Limitations** – The datasets used are small (IU X-Ray, Montgomery County CXR), weakening the empirical validation. Larger chest X-ray datasets such as MIMIC-CXR are not utilized. Clarification is needed on whether dataset choice was due to computational constraints or the proposed method itself. Training-time comparisons with other LoRA variants would be valuable. Given the small test sets (100–200 images), the evidence for effectiveness is weak.  \n3. **Evaluation Clarity and Methodology** – Evaluation choices and explanations are insufficient. The CLIP model used for text–image alignment was trained on natural images and may not appropriately assess medical imagery; the 76-token limit further restricts evaluation fidelity. The data split is also unclear (only 4% test data). It should be specified whether results in Table 1 use validation or test data. Figures 4–7 require better discussion—especially regarding rank distribution and why some LoRA methods fail on specific datasets. Additionally, alignment between generated images and textual disease descriptions could be assessed using pretrained X-ray classifiers or manual inspection.  \n4. **Additional Issues** –  \n   - The title refers to *medical image synthesis*, but the experiments focus exclusively on chest X-rays.  \n   - Derivation in Section 3.3 lacks clarity.  \n   - Reducing image resolution from 512×512 (native SD resolution) to 224×224 may constrain performance.  \n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify formula presentation in Section 3.3.  \n- Ensure consistency in naming (e.g., \"Chest X-ray\" vs. \"chest x-ray\").  \n- Correct minor typographical and grammatical issues.  \n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph (Significance, Innovation, Evaluation, Reproducibility)**  \nThe work introduces a novel idea of dynamically expanding LoRA rank using Fisher Information, contributing to innovation in parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

The experiment shows the result is promisingly.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. Computational overhead. While SeLoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, its dynamic rank expansion mechanism introduces additional computational complexity. Computing Fisher information increases the overhead, which may become significant for larger datasets or more complex models.\n2. Limited dataset evaluation. Experiments were limited to two 2D X-ray datasets, with no evaluation of SeLoRA’s performance on other modalities, such as MRI or CT scans. Further validation on additional modalities would help confirm the generalizability of the method.\n3. Visual result is limited. The visual result is not satisfactory, such as in Figure 8, the contrast and details are not good.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. Computational complexity analysis A comparison of training time, memory usage and FLOPs between SeLoRA, LoRA, and other variants is needed to quantify the computational trade-offs introduced by dynamic rank expansion.\n2. Evaluation on a wider range of datasets Evaluating SeLoRA on larger datasets, such as MIMIC-CXR (containing approximately 377,000 images), would provide more insights into its scalability. Future work could also validate SeLoRA on MRI, CT, or ultrasound datasets, as testing on diverse datasets would better demonstrate its robustness and versatility.\n3. Incorporating related work. The idea of dynamically adjusting the rank of the LoRA matrix in SeLoRA is conceptually similar to the recently proposed ALoRA (NAACL 2024). However, the two methods differ in implementation: ALoRA utilizes pruning and redistribution strategies, while SeLoRA relies on Fisher information as the adjustment criterion. Insights from ALoRA could provide valuable inspiration for future improvements of SeLoRA.\n4. Evaluation with medical doctor may help verify the experiment results.\nOther questions\n1. Unconventional split of the IU X-Ray dataset. The 80:16:4 split results in a relatively small test set, which could compromise the robustness of the evaluation. A more conventional split (e.g., 80:10:10) might provide more reliable insights.\n2. Small sample size in the Montgomery County CXR dataset. With only 138 samples, the Montgomery County dataset is too small for deep learning applications, which may impact the stability and generalizability of the model’s results\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 5",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI:**  \n   ✅ The manuscript presents a methodological contribution to *medical image synthesis* using diffusion-based generative models. Specifically, it introduces **SeLoRA** (Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) mechanism for adapting latent diffusion models to medical imaging tasks. The work focuses on rank-adaptive LoRA techniques, which are methodological innovations in model adaptation rather than purely application studies. The application to X-ray and histopathology image synthesis serves to validate methodological claims. Thus, the work fits well within TMI’s scope of *imaging methods and computational modeling*.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level:**  \n   The core novelty lies in introducing a **dynamic rank-expansion strategy guided by Fisher information** to improve parameter efficiency in diffusion model adaptation. Compared with prior adaptive LoRA or rank-pruning variants (DyLoRA, AdaLoRA, ALoRA), SeLoRA’s “self-expanding” mechanism is distinct — it allows rank growth rather than pruning and uses a theoretically motivated Fisher Information Ratio test. While LoRA-based adaptation itself is established, the proposed incremental-learning mechanism provides a methodological increment rather than a radical advance. The contribution is thus *moderately novel but technically meaningful and well-motivated.*\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor:**  \n   The algorithmic formulation (Equations 2–5, Algorithm 1) is clearly presented, and convergence considerations are discussed (Sec. 3.3). The evaluation is conducted on multiple public datasets (IU X-Ray, Montgomery CXR, PatchGastricADC22) and multiple resolutions, with ablation on threshold λ. Comparisons include LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA baselines with careful control of parameter counts. Metrics (FID, CLIP) and figures are standard and support conclusions. However:\n   - Datasets used are relatively small; external validation beyond X-ray (e.g., CT or MR) remains limited.\n   - Statistical significance or confidence intervals for FID are minimal.\n   - Limited reporting of computational cost beyond memory/time averages (no discussion of scalability or stability).\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation:**  \n   The manuscript is clearly structured and well-written, with sufficient mathematical detail and readable figures. Minor typographical issues (spacing, capitalization, and occasional OCR artifacts like “S ELF -EXPANDING”) should be corrected. Figures 3–6 are informative but somewhat dense; legends could better explain abbreviations (q, k, v, attn1, attn2).  \n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance:**  \n   The authors state publicly available code and use of publicly released datasets (IU X-Ray, Montgomery County CXR, PatchGastricADC22). No identifiable patient data are introduced, and dataset use appears consistent with public repository terms; IRB exemption would be appropriate. Reproducibility is adequately supported through provided hyperparameters and algorithm pseudocode.  \n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThis paper presents *SeLoRA*, a Self‑Expanding Low‑Rank Adaptation method for fine‑tuning latent diffusion models in medical image synthesis. The approach starts with a minimal rank and dynamically expands it per layer, guided by a Fisher Information Ratio (FI‑Ratio) criterion. This allows the model to allocate parameters strategically where adaptation is most beneficial. SeLoRA is applied to X‑ray and histopathology datasets for text‑to‑image synthesis, demonstrating improved Fréchet Inception Distance and CLIP scores relative to LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA while using fewer trainable parameters. The paper also analyzes rank allocation patterns and training efficiency.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Introduces a *methodologically motivated* dynamic rank‑expansion mechanism guided by Fisher Information—novel among LoRA variants.  \n- Demonstrates consistent improvements in synthesis quality and parameter efficiency.  \n- Offers theoretical intuition for convergence and empirical ablations across λ thresholds.  \n- Well‑structured, reproducible implementation with code availability.  \n- Applied to multiple medical imaging datasets and modalities, suggesting general applicability.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- The experimental datasets are relatively small; results may not generalize to larger or clinically diverse cohorts.  \n- The presented FID/CLIP improvements, while positive, are modest on certain datasets and lack statistical testing.  \n- Limited theoretical depth beyond heuristic Fisher scoring—no formal proof of optimality or convergence.  \n- Figures and tables sometimes contain formatting anomalies; some numerical results (e.g., FID 64/192 units) could be better explained.  \n- Comparison restricted to LoRA variants; missing baseline vs. full fine‑tuning or non‑LoRA PEFT methods in vision‑language diffusion settings.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Novelty Contextualization:** Clarify how SeLoRA’s Fisher‑guided expansion differs mathematically from existing ALoRA or adaptive‑rank LoRA variants. A concise comparison table would help establish novelty.  \n2. **Scalability Evaluation:** Include an experiment on a larger dataset (e.g., MIMIC‑CXR subset or similar) or a 3D imaging task to strengthen claims of general applicability.  \n3. **Ablation on FI‑Ratio Threshold and t:** Present quantitative curves of performance vs. parameter growth to better show the efficiency trade‑off.  \n4. **Uncertainty and Statistical Reporting:** Provide mean ± SD for FID/CLIP across multiple runs and confidence intervals for improvements.  \n5. **Clinical Relevance Discussion:** Expand on how synthesized images could be used in downstream clinical or training pipelines, addressing potential ethical use.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct typographical inconsistencies and OCR artifacts (e.g., “Fisher information Ratio”, “S ELF‑EXPANDING”).  \n- Improve figure readability—especially Figures 3–6—by using consistent color scales and adding legends.  \n- Ensure all dataset citations (e.g., IU X‑Ray, Montgomery CXR, PatchGastricADC22) include proper repository URLs or DOIs.  \n- Clarify units for memory/time tables and refer consistently to “GPU‑hours” or “memory (GB)”.  \n- Verify that all hyperparameters (λ, t, r) are defined upon first mention in the main text.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation**  \n**Major Revision.**  \nThe paper presents a promising and well‑implemented methodological contribution within TMI’s scope. However, it requires additional evidence of generalizability and more rigorous comparative and statistical analysis to meet TMI’s standards for methodological maturity. With extended validation and stronger framing of novelty, SeLoRA could be a valuable addition to the literature on parameter‑efficient adaptation for medical imaging generative models.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4 / 5 — Confident in technical assessment and TMI scope alignment.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents SeLoRA (Self-Expanding Low-Rank Adaptation), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for adapting latent diffusion models to medical image synthesis. The authors address the limitation that standard LoRA applies uniform ranking across all linear layers, which may be suboptimal for the diverse weight matrix shapes in diffusion models' U-Net architecture. SeLoRA dynamically expands ranks during training using Fisher information as a guide, starting from rank r=1 and strategically placing additional ranks on crucial layers. The method is evaluated on chest X-ray datasets (IU X-RAY and Montgomery County CXR) for text-conditioned medical image synthesis. Results show that SeLoRA achieves superior FID scores and CLIP scores compared to standard LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA while using fewer trainable parameters (Section 4, Tables 1-2). The rank allocation analysis demonstrates that SeLoRA concentrates higher ranks on attention layers where text and image embeddings interact (Figures 3-4).\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and clarity issues**\n  - The FI-Ratio definition in Equation 5 uses inconsistent notation where the denominator should logically be larger than numerator for meaningful interpretation, but the paper suggests expansion when FI-Ratio ≥ λ > 1, creating conceptual confusion about what constitutes \"improvement\"\n  - Algorithm 1 lacks mathematical precision in the expansion condition, particularly in how the FI-Scores are computed for the expanded matrices A′ and B′ without parameter updates\n  - The convergence analysis in Section 3.3 provides only intuitive arguments without formal mathematical proof, and the approximation of FI-Ratio lacks rigorous derivation of the assumed relationship between rank and Fisher information\n\n• **Limited experimental validation and dataset scope**\n  - Evaluation is restricted to only two small chest X-ray datasets (3,955 and 138 images respectively as noted in Section 3.4), which limits generalizability claims for medical image synthesis\n  - No comparison with full fine-tuning baselines or other parameter-efficient methods beyond LoRA variants, missing important performance context for the claimed efficiency gains\n  - The PatchGastricADC22 results in Appendix show SeLoRA performing worse than LoRA on the primary FID metric (Table 6), contradicting the main narrative of consistent superiority\n  - Statistical significance testing is absent despite reporting standard deviations in Tables 1-2, making it unclear whether observed differences are statistically meaningful\n\n• **Methodological concerns and incomplete analysis**\n  - The Fisher information calculation in Equation 3 uses empirical estimation over single batches, which may be noisy and unstable for reliable expansion decisions during training\n  - Hyperparameter selection (λ=1.1, t=40) appears arbitrary with insufficient justification or sensitivity analysis beyond the limited ablation in Table 3\n  - The rank expansion strategy lacks theoretical grounding for why Fisher information should be the optimal criterion for determining when to expand, and no comparison with alternative expansion criteria is provided\n  - Missing analysis of computational overhead during training, particularly the cost of repeatedly computing FI-Scores every t steps for expansion testing\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and strengthen mathematical foundations**\n  - Reformulate the FI-Ratio definition in Equation 5 with clear explanation of why this specific ratio indicates improvement, and provide formal mathematical justification for the expansion criterion\n  - Add rigorous algorithmic details in Algorithm 1 specifying exactly how FI-Scores are computed for expanded matrices, including gradient computation procedures without parameter updates\n  - Develop formal convergence proof for the rank expansion algorithm with clear bounds, and derive the FI-Ratio approximation in Section 3.3 with explicit assumptions and mathematical steps\n\n• **Expand experimental validation comprehensively**\n  - Include evaluation on larger and more diverse medical imaging datasets beyond chest X-rays to demonstrate broader applicability across medical imaging modalities and scales\n  - Add comparisons with full fine-tuning and other PEFT methods (e.g., adapters, prompt tuning) to provide complete performance context and justify the focus on LoRA-based approaches\n  - Conduct statistical significance testing for all reported metrics and provide detailed analysis of why SeLoRA underperforms on PatchGastricADC22, addressing apparent contradictions in performance claims\n  - Report comprehensive computational analysis including training time, memory usage, and FLOPs comparison across all methods with proper statistical analysis\n\n• **Strengthen methodological rigor and theoretical justification**\n  - Investigate stability of Fisher information estimation and propose more robust alternatives, including analysis of how batch size and gradient noise affect expansion decisions\n  - Conduct thorough hyperparameter sensitivity analysis across multiple datasets and provide principled guidelines for selecting λ and t values based on dataset characteristics\n  - Compare Fisher information criterion with alternative expansion strategies (e.g., gradient magnitude, loss-based criteria) and provide theoretical analysis of why Fisher information is optimal for this task\n  - Add detailed computational cost analysis of the expansion testing procedure and propose efficiency improvements to reduce the overhead of frequent FI-Score computation",

SeLoRA dynamically adjusts the rank of the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices during training, allowing for more flexible and efficient adaptation of pre-trained models to medical datasets. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of SeLoRA through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on X-ray datasets, showcasing improvements in both FID scores and CLIP scores compared to other LoRA variants. The manuscript is well-written and clearly articulates the technical innovations and motivations behind SeLoRA.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The introduction of dynamic rank adjustment in LoRA is a significant contribution to the field of parameter-efficient fine-tuning. However, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing methods that also aim to optimize rank allocation, such as DyLoRA and AdaLoRA. The authors should explicitly discuss the unique contributions and distinctions of SeLoRA in terms of both methodology and performance.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily conducted on two X-ray datasets, which limits the generalizability of the findings. Including a wider range of medical imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI) would provide a more comprehensive assessment of SeLoRA's capabilities. Additionally, the experiments are performed at different resolutions, but it would be beneficial to include a more extensive analysis of the impact of resolution on the performance of SeLoRA.\n\n3. Comparisons: The comparisons with LoRA, AdaLoRA, and DyLoRA are thorough, but the manuscript should also consider including state-of-the-art methods for medical image synthesis as benchmarks. This would help establish the relative performance of SeLoRA in the broader context of medical imaging research.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript states that the code is publicly available, which is commendable. However, the description of the training protocols and hyperparameters is somewhat sparse. Providing a more detailed description of the training setup, including the exact configurations and hyperparameters used, would greatly enhance the reproducibility of the results.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 3 and 4 are cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions for clarity.\n   \n2. Notation and Terminology: The notation for the forward operator is introduced without sufficient explanation. Definitions for acronyms like \"R=4\" are missing.\n   \n3. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors exist, such as \"k-spacce\" on page 6 and \"undersampling maskes\" on page 7.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses the significant challenge of synthesizing high-quality medical images from limited annotated data, which is a crucial issue in medical imaging. SeLoRA offers a promising approach to parameter-efficient fine-tuning by dynamically adjusting the rank of LoRA matrices. The technical innovation is compelling and has the potential to advance the field of medical image synthesis. However, the evaluation is currently limited to a few datasets and modalities, which weakens the claims of broad applicability. The reproducibility of the approach is satisfactory due to the availability of the code, but more detailed methodological descriptions are needed. Overall, while the idea has merit, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include a broader range of medical imaging modalities, provide more detailed descriptions of the training protocols, and clarify the unique contributions of SeLoRA in the context of existing methods.",

Lung tumor boards often review these scans manually, a time-consuming process. This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach for lung tumor segmentation by framing the problem as anomaly detection. The method is divided into two stages, allowing each model to leverage its strengths. Stage 1 focuses on region proposal, employing a custom Deformable Detection Transformer with Focal Loss to overcome class imbalance and localize sparse tumors. In Stage 2, the predicted bounding boxes are refined into pixel-wise segmentation masks using a fine-tuned variant of Meta's Segment Anything Model (SAM) for semantic segmentation. To address the challenge of nodule sparsity and improve spatial context, a 7.5 mm Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) is applied, aiding in the differentiation between nodules, bronchioles, and vascular structures. The model achieves a Dice coefficient of 92.4%, with 95.2% sensitivity and 93.2% precision on the LUNA16 dataset, demonstrating robust performance in real-world clinical conditions where nodule sparsity is 5%.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a two-stage pipeline for lung nodule segmentation in CT scans, designed to support lung tumor boards by enhancing segmentation accuracy and efficiency. The first stage employs a custom Deformable Detection Transformer (DETR) architecture to detect sparse lung tumors, leveraging deformable attention to improve sensitivity to small nodules. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM), enhanced with medical imaging capabilities (MedSAM), to refine the bounding boxes into pixel-level segmentation masks, ensuring precision in differentiating nodules from surrounding anatomy.\n\nTo address the class imbalance in CT data - where lung nodules are rare compared to healthy tissue - the framework incorporates focal loss, reducing model bias towards non-tumor areas and enhancing detection accuracy for hard-to-detect nodules. Achieving a 94.2% F1 score for bounding box prediction and a 92.4% Dice coefficient in segmentation accuracy, this pipeline demonstrates strong potential to improve clinical workflows, enhance tumor board decision-making, and contribute to better patient outcomes by streamlining nodule detection in a clinical setting.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper introduces a novel two-stage approach for lung tumor segmentation by framing the task as anomaly detection, addressing the challenges of sparse nodule identification in CT scans. This innovative structure uses a Deformable Detection Transformer (DETR) for region proposals and a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM) for precise segmentation, effectively handling class imbalance and complex image features.\n\nAdditionally, the paper’s clear, logical structure and well-explained methodology make complex concepts accessible. Detailed quantitative results further highlight the framework's effectiveness, making it a valuable and readable contribution to medical imaging and clinical decision support.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The paper’s experimental section lacks depth, with insufficient analysis to thoroughly validate the proposed method. \n\n2. There is no ablation study provided, which limits insight into how each component - such as the use of Deformable Detection Transformer (DETR), the fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM), and the customized focal loss - contributes to overall performance. Without this breakdown, it’s difficult to assess which aspects of the framework are most effective. \n\n3. The paper relies solely on quantitative evaluation, omitting any qualitative assessment, such as visual comparisons among different methods, which could provide a clearer understanding of the model's segmentation accuracy and real-world applicability.\n\n4. The presentation of results is also weak, with layout issues that detract from readability and professionalism. For instance, Table 2 extends beyond the page margin, rendering the data difficult to interpret. Additionally, there are inconsistencies and errors in in-text citations, which may confuse readers and hinder the paper’s credibility. These issues in presentation and citation detract from the paper's overall clarity and polish, suggesting the need for more careful formatting and editing. There are also several grammatical errors, which make the paper somewhat challenging to read.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Why is there only quantitative evaluation/comparison provided in the manuscript? Could you provide some qualitative results, such as visual examples of segmentation outputs, to illustrate the model’s performance?\n\n- Can you elaborate on how the class imbalance was handled during training? Were any additional strategies (besides focal loss) considered or tested to further address this issue?\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 5\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nNone",

Overall, the clarity of the manuscript can be improved, especially concerning its methodology.\n\n### Major Comments\n1. The entire preprocessing and modeling process is conducted in 2D. This may hinder the differentiation of diseased lungs or lung cancers that are located near the thoracic wall. \n2. Nodules with subsolid or ground-glass opacity (GGO) characteristics might not be effectively visualized in thicker MIP slices; thus, these types should be assessed separately.\n3. While the model achieves superior performance compared to prior models, it lacks subclass analysis and an ablation study, which limits its technical novelty.\n4. The paper lacks external validation, raising concerns regarding the generalizability of the findings.\n\n### Minor Comments\n- Clarification is needed on how preprocessing at a 1 mm isocubic resolution produces a 7.5 mm MIP using five slices, as shown in Figure 1-c.\n- The authors should analyze and include the histogram of nodules under 10 mm from the LIDC dataset in their discussion.\n- The segmentation performed with Otsu method as indicated in Figure 1-b should have accompanying accuracy metrics, such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).\n\n### Summary Paragraph\nIn terms of significance, the manuscript addresses an important issue in lung tumor segmentation but lacks depth in evaluation and analysis of results. The innovation is present through the novel use of MIP; however, the predominance of 2D processing and lack of performance validation diminishes its potential impact. The evaluation does provide some improvements over previous efforts, but the absence of thorough testing and validation limits reproducibility.

The combination of Deformable-DETR for localization and fine-tuned SAM for pixel-level segmentation constitutes a methodological pipeline, aligning with TMI’s emphasis on imaging computation rather than clinical application alone.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level** –  \nModerate-to-strong novelty. The integration of Deformable DETR and MedSAM within a unified workflow for sparse nodule segmentation is new, especially accompanied by dedicated preprocessing (7.5mm MIP) and the use of focal loss to address extreme data imbalance. Nonetheless, each component (DETR, SAM, focal loss, MIP) is known; thus, the innovation primarily stems from architectural integration and adaptation for real-world, low-prevalence CT data. The level of methodological insight is solid but not fully foundational — best classified as a hybrid systems contribution.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor** –  \nGenerally rigorous: dataset preparation and preprocessing are transparently described; the LUNA16 dataset is correctly characterized. Proper train/validation/test splitting, balance between realism and feasibility, and inclusion of augmentation are clear strengths. Some empirical concerns remain: only a single dataset (LUNA16) was used, and no cross-dataset generalization or ablation beyond γ/α tuning is presented. The grounding in 2D MIP versus 3D context warrants further comparison. Uncertainty analysis or statistical significance testing is absent.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation** –  \nHigh clarity and polished narrative; figures are described adequately, although small inconsistencies in reference formatting and equation typography exist. Some long sentences could be edited for conciseness.

Summary\nThis manuscript introduces a two-stage transformer-based framework for automated segmentation of lung metastases on CT. Stage 1 employs a customized Deformable DETR detector with focal loss on 7.5 mm MIP slices to propose bounding boxes, addressing tumor sparsity and class imbalance. Stage 2 refines these proposals using a fine‑tuned variant of MedSAM to generate pixel‑level masks. Tested on the LUNA16 dataset, the approach achieved a Dice ≈ 92 % and sensitivity ≈ 95 %, outperforming recent CNN‑based baselines. The work aims to integrate into tumor‑board workflows for decision support.\n\n### 2. Strengths\n- Strong alignment with current interests in transformer architectures for medical imaging.\n- Clear methodological articulation and preprocessing transparency (resampling, MIP generation, augmentation).\n- Quantitative improvement over published baselines on a standard dataset.\n- Addressing clinical realism by preserving low nodule prevalence in the test set.\n- Writing is accessible and figures assist conceptual understanding.\n\n### 3. Weaknesses\n- Limited validation: only one dataset and no external testing or cross‑comparison to human annotators.\n- Methodological innovation lies in pipeline integration rather than a new theoretical contribution.\n- Absence of ablation or sensitivity analyses (e.g., effect of MIP slab thickness, focal loss parameters, SAM fine‑tuning depth).\n- Unclear computational cost and inference time, crucial for clinical workflows.\n- Reproducibility discussion (code/data policy) lacking.\n- The “tumor‑board” framing is more aspirational than demonstrated.\n\n### 4. Major Comments\n1. **Clarify Novelty Relative to Prior DETR/SAM Applications** – The manuscript would benefit from explicitly differentiating how the joint DETR–SAM pipeline qualitatively advances beyond sequential detection‑segmentation schemes in existing literature.  \n2. **Include External or Cross‑Validation Dataset** – Demonstrating performance on at least one additional dataset (e.g., LIDC‑IDRI full set, or variation in CT reconstruction kernels) is essential for TMI to assess methodological robustness.  \n3. **Ablation and Sensitivity Analysis** – Quantify contributions from each component (MIP, focal loss, deformable attention, two‑stage structure).  \n4. **Computational Efficiency** – Provide benchmark timings (inference per scan, GPU type, memory footprint).  \n5. **Statistical Rigor** – Report confidence intervals or statistical tests across folds; a single best Dice value is insufficient at TMI standard.  \n6. **Reproducibility Statement** – Add explicit mention of code availability, trained model weights, and details sufficient for replication.  \n7. **Clinical Integration Claim** – Tone down assertions regarding “tumor board application” unless validated by user study or workflow integration trial.\n\n### 5. Minor Comments\n- Correct minor grammatical inconsistencies (e.g., “is impractical as it is time‑consuming” → streamline).  \n- Ensure consistent superscript formatting of equations and symbols.  \n- Add journal and year details to some references; check duplicated Lin et al. (2017a/2017b) citations.  \n- Figures 1–4 should include scale bars and resolution information.  \n- Re‑evaluate section numbering (minor spacing and caption formatting per IEEE guidelines).\n\n### 6. Overall Recommendation\n**Major Revision** – The paper is promising and within TMI scope but needs additional methodological validation and experimental depth (cross‑dataset testing, ablation, performance metrics) to meet TMI’s rigor and generalizability standards. If these are addressed, publication could be justified as a substantive systems innovation paper.\n\n### 7.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper presents a two-stage transformer-based approach for lung nodule segmentation in CT scans to support tumor board applications. The method addresses class imbalance challenges where nodules appear in only 5% of CT slices. Stage 1 employs a custom Deformable Detection Transformer with Focal Loss for region proposal to localize sparse tumors. Stage 2 uses a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM) initialized with MedSAM weights for pixel-wise segmentation refinement. The preprocessing pipeline includes 7.5mm Maximum Intensity Projection (MIP) to enhance nodule visibility and differentiate nodules from vascular structures. Evaluated on LUNA16 dataset, the method achieves 92.4% Dice coefficient, 95.2% sensitivity, and 93.2% precision, with an F1 score of 94.2% for region proposal. The approach demonstrates superior performance compared to existing CNN and hybrid CNN-transformer methods, particularly for medium and large nodules.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation inconsistencies and notation issues**\n  - Equation (1) presents resampling factor R with inconsistent vector notation, showing R as both a vector and individual ratios without clear dimensional specification (Page 3, lines 117-120), which creates ambiguity in implementation\n  - The computational complexity formula O(H²W²C) in Section 3.3 incorrectly states C=1 for grayscale images when describing feature map channels from ResNet-50 backbone (Page 4, lines 214-216), as ResNet-50 typically outputs multi-channel feature maps\n  - Focal loss parameters γ=2 and αt=0.25 are mentioned as optimal through hyperparameter tuning (Page 7, lines 340-343) but no systematic evaluation or comparison with other parameter combinations is provided\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - Training set contains 12.7% nodule-positive images while test set has only 5% (Page 4, lines 180-184), creating a significant domain shift that may overestimate real-world performance and compromise model generalizability\n  - Stage 2 evaluation lacks independent assessment, as Table 1 shows only overall Dice coefficient of 92.4% without breakdown by nodule size categories (Page 6, Table 1), preventing detailed analysis of segmentation quality across different tumor characteristics\n  - Comparison with existing methods in Table 2 lacks statistical significance testing and confidence intervals (Page 7, Table 2), making it difficult to assess whether reported improvements are statistically meaningful\n\n• **Technical implementation and reproducibility concerns**\n  - MIP slab thickness of 7.5mm selection is mentioned as \"suitable compromise\" (Page 3, lines 138-140) but no systematic evaluation of different thickness values or quantitative justification is provided\n  - Stage 1 and Stage 2 training details are incompletely specified, with missing information about convergence criteria, early stopping, and final model selection procedures (Page 5, Section 3.5), hindering reproducibility\n  - The claim of being \"trained from scratch\" for Deformable-DETR (Page 4, line 199) contradicts the use of ResNet-50 backbone, which typically uses pre-trained weights, creating confusion about the actual training methodology\n\n• **Limited clinical validation and generalizability assessment**\n  - Evaluation is restricted to LUNA16 dataset only, with no validation on independent clinical datasets or multi-center data (throughout results section), limiting evidence for real-world tumor board applicability\n  - No analysis of computational requirements, inference time, or practical deployment considerations for clinical integration (no direct evidence found in the manuscript), despite the stated tumor board application focus\n  - Missing discussion of failure cases, edge conditions, or limitations in detecting specific nodule types or anatomical locations (no direct evidence found in the manuscript), which is crucial for clinical decision support systems\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify mathematical formulations and provide rigorous notation**\n  - Revise Equation (1) to use consistent vector notation and specify dimensional units clearly, providing implementation pseudocode to eliminate ambiguity in the resampling procedure\n  - Correct the computational complexity analysis by accurately describing the multi-channel feature maps from ResNet-50 and provide detailed complexity comparison with standard DETR\n  - Include systematic hyperparameter sensitivity analysis for focal loss parameters, showing performance curves across different γ and αt values with statistical error bars\n\n• **Strengthen experimental design and provide comprehensive evaluation**\n  - Conduct additional experiments with matched nodule prevalence between training and test sets, and report performance degradation analysis when prevalence varies to better estimate real-world applicability\n  - Provide detailed Stage 2 evaluation breakdown by nodule size categories, including per-class Dice coefficients, hausdorff distances, and boundary accuracy metrics to enable thorough segmentation quality assessment\n  - Add statistical significance testing with confidence intervals for all performance comparisons, including bootstrap sampling or cross-validation to establish statistical validity of reported improvements\n\n• **Enhance technical documentation and ensure reproducibility**\n  - Conduct systematic evaluation of MIP thickness parameters (e.g., 5mm, 7.5mm, 10mm, 15mm) with quantitative metrics showing trade-offs between nodule visibility and structural overlap\n  - Provide complete training specifications including convergence criteria, validation monitoring, learning curves, and model selection procedures, along with computational resource requirements and training time analysis\n  - Clarify the exact pre-training strategy for all model components, specify which weights are initialized versus trained from scratch, and provide detailed architecture modifications made to standard Deformable-DETR\n\n• **Expand clinical validation and address practical deployment considerations**\n  - Validate the approach on additional independent datasets beyond LUNA16, including multi-center clinical data and different CT scanner manufacturers to demonstrate broader generalizability\n  - Include comprehensive computational performance analysis with inference times, memory requirements, and hardware specifications needed for practical tumor board integration\n  - Provide detailed failure case analysis, including examples of missed nodules, false positives, and challenging anatomical scenarios, along with guidelines for clinical interpretation and limitations",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\n### This manuscript introduces a novel two-stage approach for lung nodule segmentation in CT scans, aimed at enhancing the workflow efficiency of lung tumor boards. The method employs a custom Deformable Detection Transformer (Deformable-DETR) with Focal Loss for region proposal and refines these proposals using a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM) for pixel-wise segmentation. The authors claim that their approach effectively handles the extreme class imbalance typical of lung nodule datasets, achieving a Dice coefficient of 92.4% and high sensitivity and precision on the LUNA16 dataset. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for addressing the challenges of nodule sparsity and class imbalance is clearly articulated.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The proposed two-stage approach leveraging Deformable-DETR and SAM is innovative, particularly in the context of lung nodule segmentation. However, the manuscript does not sufficiently discuss how this approach compares to recent advancements in transformer-based medical imaging models. A more comprehensive comparison with existing works would strengthen the novelty argument.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design: The experiments are conducted exclusively on the LUNA16 dataset, which, while standard, limits the generalizability of the results. Broader validation on multiple datasets, including those with varying degrees of nodule sparsity, would be necessary to substantiate the claims of robust performance across different clinical settings.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript lacks a detailed comparison with recent transformer-based models and other state-of-the-art methods that address class imbalance. Including additional baselines would provide a clearer picture of the relative performance and advantages of the proposed method.\n\n4. Reproducibility: While the authors state that code will be released, the current manuscript lacks sufficient detail regarding training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters. Providing a clear and detailed methodology is crucial for reproducibility.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figure Clarity: Figures 1 and 4 are somewhat cluttered. Simplifying these figures by focusing on fewer representative slices and providing zoomed-in regions would enhance readability.\n   \n2. Notational Consistency: The notation introduced in Section 2.1 is inconsistent and lacks sufficient explanation, particularly for the forward operator. Clarifying this notation would aid in understanding the mathematical formulations.\n   \n3. Acronym Definitions: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definitions. Defining these acronyms would improve clarity for readers.\n   \n4. Typographical Errors: There are typographical issues throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7). These should be corrected.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses the significant clinical challenge of accurately segmenting lung nodules in CT scans, a task complicated by extreme class imbalance and nodule sparsity. The proposed two-stage approach combining Deformable-DETR and SAM shows promise in handling these challenges. However, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset, and the manuscript could benefit from a more thorough comparison with recent transformer-based models. The reproducibility of the approach is also uncertain due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, while the idea is promising, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision: The authors should expand comparative analysis, broaden validation across multiple datasets, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

Thirdly, we create\na novel 3D image block ranking algorithm to generate a “Block Ranking Map\n(BRM)” by using the axial patch ranking scores, coronal patch ranking scores, and\nsagittal patch ranking scores. Lastly, we develop a hybrid 3D image block ranking\nalgorithm to generate a reliable hybrid BRM by using different block ranking\nscores generated by the 3D image block ranking algorithm using different top feature\nsets. The associations between brain areas and a brain disease are reliably\ngenerated by using hybrid information from ChatGPT and relevant publications.\nThe simulation results using two different 3D data sets indicate that the novel hybrid\n3D image block ranking algorithm can identify top-ranked blocks associated\nwith important brain areas related to AD diagnosis and autism diagnosis.

        "text": "### Summary\n\nAuthors present a method for modifying Grad-CAM feature attribution maps that is able to identify the most important 'blocks' in a 3D MRI brain image. The method is applied to output features of a trained CNN by sectioning each 3D image axis into an equal number of patches. The features from Grad-CAM are passed through a feature selection (FS) method consisting of a combination of standard library functions including recursive feature elimination (RFE). The resulting `k` ranked features are accumulated axis- (or patch-) wise, and the patches from different combinations of FS methods are passed into final step that aggregates the 2D features into 3D block features. The blocks that contain the most patches with highest ranking features are selected as the most important blocks. Authors evaluate their method by verifying that the selected blocks correspond with those that are know to be important in the literature, as well as asking Chat-GPT. Author's provide clinical reasoning to explain the attributions.\n\n### Soundness: 3\n\n### Presentation: 2\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n* The target of the Authors' work is important and moves towards a more explainable and trustworthy result for use by clinicians.\n* Authors are thorough in their definitions and attempt to give the reader the detail to reproduce their work.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n* In general, this paper is badly formatted and overly verbose. The notation is difficult to keep consistent and often badly defined. Further comments to this are made in the `Questions` section below.\n* Authors spend very little time reviewing prior work and setting their method in context - Authors should add explanations of related prior work including methods for using statistical analysis of Grad-CAM attribution and saliency maps to identify significant regions in input data.\n* Authors inexplicably use Chat-GPT to test the reliability of their method by asking it to verify the important brain regions associated with AD - there is no explanation for this, and no reason to be doing that instead of actually asking clinicians.\n* Authors present their method only on a single 3D MRI dataset and do not discuss its applicability to other modalities, or indeed any other domain. Authors cannot claim that this is a method for \"Explainable Medical Imaging\" when results on a single dataset are reported.\n\n### Questions\n\n### Major Comments\n* The definitions and notation presented in the paper are cumbersome, and difficult to read. This starts with the statement `P (H-bar/H) x (W-bar/W) patches for P=HW` (line 92) that is repeated several times (187, 214 etc.) which could be replaced by a less obtuse definition of patch size. Authors also do not define _n_ in this Section 2. Authors should better define their variables. Additionally, the cumbersome notation in definitions 1-6 is largely unnecessary - Authors can simplify this section by removing superfluous 'definitions' and describing the process through which they yield the ranking matrices: this will avoid repetition of the `i` and `j` indices and shorten this bloated paper.\n* On a similar note, Authors introduce additional notation for the 'top feature map' `T^Q`. This terminology is confusing. It is not a top \"feature map\", but rather an aggregated \"top k features\" map combining the Grad-CAM features selected by 'some feature selection method'. Authors should consider re-wording this.\n* Lines 221-234 - Authors present their 8 steps for Image Block Ranking algorithm. This is presented badly - the reader is capable of understanding that the same steps are applied to the 3 different axis without making each step of this method so verbose. Figure 1 shows this much better in fact. Authors should describe steps 1-7 on a single axis to improve readability.\n* Authors show a visualization of important blocks identified by their method in Figure 2b. The full Grad-CAM output without feature selection is shown in Figure 3b. It is evident that applying some thresholding to the full feature map, and even just applying the brain-boundary regional constraints, would yield a similar map to their own. Can author's comment on the significant differences between using the Grad-CAM values directly in this way, rather than the additional steps in their method? It would have been helpful to show some quantitative comparison in their results given this is supposed to be an extension of Grad-CAM -based methods.\n* Why did Authors use Chat-GPT in their evaluations? What is the benefit of this over asking the clinicians which Authors repeated claim that this system is aimed at helping?\n* Have Authors used this method on other domains or modalities to demonstrate its effectiveness?\n\n### Minor Comments\n* The paragraph from lines 57 contains a lot of repetition and should be pared down: this sentiment is reflected in many parts of the paper. The reader is clear that having better explainability is important and that a clinician can use this information to inform their diagnosis.\n* Line 147 \"... makes a more impact on the decision\" - to what decision are the Authors referring?\n* Line 148 \"... we use a trained CNN to generate L heatmaps...\" - the language here is confusing: Authors are referring to the model on which they are performing Grad-CAM, not a random trained model that generates heatmaps.\n* Table 2 is unclear - why is much of the table blank?\n* Line 489 - this is confusing: what is meant by the 'the 9th ... patches are shown'?. There are 16x16 patches in each of the 3 axis images shown, and a single patch at (6, 10, 9) is highlighted.\n* Section 4.1 - it is absolutely unnecessary to bloat this section with the indicies that correspond to the brain boundary - put this in the appendix, or show it as an image if the Authors feel it adds to their explanation.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4\n\n### Details Of Ethics Concerns\n\nI question the validity of using Chat-GPT in this work - but no significant Ethics concerns.",

The approach partitions each 3D image into patches, applies recursive feature elimination and other selection methods to Grad-CAM outputs, and aggregates results across axes to identify key regions. The study compares these identified blocks to known disease-relevant regions and includes additional qualitative verification using ChatGPT and clinical interpretations.

The feature maps produced in the maxpooling convolutional layers are used to derive various representations such as heatmap matrics, feature matrices, and the values within them are ranked individually per view and then combined into a 3D block ranking. The authors claim the resulting visualization gives better indication of the disease and demonstrate this on ADNI data for Alzheimer's disease. \n\nThe paper is poorly written and many of the details seem to be automatically written through a translation software or perhaps LLM judging by the language used. For example, reading the abstract had a lot of details  that typically seen in results sections later rather than focusing on a high-level summary of the approach.  Another example is a sentence in line 164-165 which reads \"Different from traditional CAM-based methods without FS a new FS-Grad-CAM methods uses a FS method to select the top k features from m flattened features.\" - Is this referring to their proposed approach. Normally we would phrase it as \"Unlike traditional CAM-based methods, we propose a new method called FS-Grad_CAM where we employ a feature selection method to select the top K feature from m flattened features first before applying GradCAM.\" \n\n Many details are unclear including the novelty with respect to other 3DGradCam methods (see eblow). Overall, it needs a major rewrite and using clinically relevant terminology with better motivation of the healthcare problem addressed.\n\n### Soundness: 1\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 1\n\n### Strengths\n\nPaper is about explainable AI showing clinicians relevant features useful for diagnosis in the 3D MRI images by taking slices in multiple views and offering top-ranked patches that are correlated with disease and understand the relationship between the top blocks and the decisions made by 3D CNN. As such, the paper attempts an important problem, namely, making the disease classification more explainable to clinicians. The familiar mechanisms of GradCam are used and attempt is made to process complex MRI datasets in multiple views. If the method could be clearly explained, one could even see value in the technique for 3DGradCam in general although other 3D GradCam tools are available. The main argument appears to be that GradCam should be applied after feature selection in the feature maps.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nAs mentioned above, the paper is poorly written to determine if the idea being proposed is a variation of 3D gradCam. No comparisons are made to any methods to even see its merit. Several open questions arise (see below). \nThere are several tools available for 3DGradCam such as these. If they are not relevant for comparison, it would be helpful to at least explain how your method differs from these. \nhttps://github.com/fitushar/3D-Grad-CAM\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/357899396_Automated_grading_of_enlarged_perivascular_spaces_in_clinical_imaging_data_of_an_acute_stroke_cohort_using_an_interpretable_3D_deep_learning_framework\n\nThe paper in current problem needs a full rewrite starting with explanation of the MRI disease visualization problem, the role of existing 3D GradCam and the need for feature selection prior to GradCam. The whole idea of class activation maps was to allow us to see the rationale for the classification with the visualization itself in a way doing regional feature selection. By applying a separate feature selection operator a priori, what would be the impact on the gradient operators and the resulting activation maps?\n\nChatGPT is briefly mentioned and it is not clear what it is being used for.\nWhat does it mean to say ChatGPT is used to verify if a brain area is associated with a disease? What is the prompt used? What are the input, only text or text and image, is a bounding box and a prompt given as input. How accurate is ChatGPT in identifying  the brain areas associated with the disease. All these should be added to explain the use of ChatGPT.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. What is the rationale for a top-ranked 3Dimage block being correlated with diseases? Real-life experiences with 2d heat maps alone indicate they are not always a reliable indicator of a disease. Since a disease may be seen in some view better than other views, the method of fusion is important between the 3 views. Provide more discussion or justification for the correlation between top-ranked blocks and diseases, and the fusion method would help clarify better. \n\n2. How is the ranking of the blocks done? In general, what does ranking mean in your context, is it just a matter of selecting high-valued entries in the feature and heat map matrices?\n\n3. What is the purpose of ChatGPT in the work? It is said it is to verify if a brain area is associated with a disease. How does it work? Are both prompt text and image supplied as input? How accurate is ChatGPT in identifying  the brain areas associated with the disease. This discussion is brief and unconvincing so elaborating on how exactly ChatGPT is used and what its inputs are would explain this section better.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

There exists 3D medical imaging visual explanation algorithm (e.g. Respond-CAM) which might be a good benchmark to compare with.\n2. Lack of generality: The paper only evaluated on one dataset, which cannot guarantee the generality of the proposed method. More tests are needed to justify the statement.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. It would be great if any qualitative/quantitative comparison with similar algorithm could be added to help the readers to better evaluate the performance of the proposed method.\n2. It would be ideal if more dataset could be used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method (e.g. LUNA 16 lung nodule dataset)\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 3",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript proposes new algorithms for *explainable 3D medical imaging*, including a feature‑selection‑based Grad‑CAM method, a 2D patch‑ranking algorithm, and a hybrid 3D image‑block ranking framework integrating axial, coronal, and sagittal views. These are methodological contributions to medical image analysis and visualization of learned representations—squarely within the methodological scope of *IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging*.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe integration of feature selection into Grad‑CAM (FS‑Grad‑CAM) and the multiview fusion of 2D patch rankings to form a 3D “Block Ranking Map” represent incremental but nontrivial extensions of existing explainability strategies.  \nHowever, the novelty is partly algorithmic engineering rather than theoretical innovation. The extensive definition of matrices and ranking functions demonstrates effort toward formalization, yet conceptual advances beyond existing explainability frameworks (e.g., Grad‑CAM++, Score‑CAM, SHAP‑CAM) are modest. Claims about clinical interpretability through ChatGPT‑assisted verification are unconventional and not well‑founded scientifically.  \n→ **Borderline for TMI novelty**: between a methodological extension and an application framework.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nThe manuscript includes substantial mathematical notation but limited quantitative validation. There is no ablation or statistical significance test demonstrating that FS‑Grad‑CAM or hybrid block ranking improve interpretability or classification beyond baseline CAM methods. The use of ChatGPT to “verify” brain‑region associations is not scientifically valid for peer‑reviewed evidence. Dataset use (ADNI, Autism datasets) is appropriate, but reproducibility (code, parameters, number of subjects per split, model hyperparameters) is sparse. Overall rigor is *medium*.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe paper is generally readable, yet lengthy, repetitive, and formally dense. There are numerous typographic inconsistencies (spacing, equation numbering, variable notation). Figures and tables are described but might be visually crowded. The hierarchical organization could be streamlined. English is adequate but could benefit from editing for conciseness and academic tone.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nPublic datasets (ADNI, Kaggle autism) are cited appropriately. No mention is made of IRB or subject consent, though likely not needed for secondary anonymized data. No code availability statement. Use of generative AI (“ChatGPT used to verify clinical associations”) raises *ethical and methodological concern*—should be omitted or reframed as literature-based validation only.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2 – IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n1. **Summary**  \nThe authors introduce a feature‑selection‑based Grad‑CAM (FS‑Grad‑CAM) to generate more interpretable 2D heatmaps by focusing on top‑ranked features, a five‑factor 2D patch‑ranking algorithm that combines multiple feature and activation matrices, and a hybrid 3D image‑block ranking approach that fuses axial, coronal, and sagittal patch rankings into a 3D Block Ranking Map (BRM). Applied to ADNI and an autism brain‑MRI dataset, the framework identifies small 3D “important blocks” purportedly associated with disease-related brain regions.\n\n2. **Strengths**\n- Addresses explainability of 3D CNNs—a current and significant challenge in medical deep learning.\n- Proposes a structured approach combining feature selection and multiview fusion.  \n- Provides detailed definitions and reproducible conceptual framework.  \n- Demonstrates feasibility on two public 3D brain‑MRI datasets.  \n- Potentially useful as a visualization and interpretability aid.\n\n3. **Weaknesses**\n- Limited scientific novelty; largely an extension of existing Grad‑CAM/Fusion ideas.  \n- Validation lacks quantitative metrics for interpretability or diagnostic utility.  \n- Reliance on ChatGPT outputs to confirm neuroanatomical associations undermines scientific rigor.  \n- The methods are excessively complicated without theoretical justification and not benchmarked against recent explainability methods.  \n- Writing and formatting need significant refinement.  \n- No error bars, cross‑validation, or statistical tests; reproducibility not demonstrated.\n\n4. **Major Comments**\n1. **Quantitative evaluation** – Include comparative experiments vs. standard Grad‑CAM, Grad‑CAM++, and other explainability methods using objective interpretability metrics or human expert assessment.  \n2. **Remove ChatGPT verification** – Replace with expert review or established neuroimaging literature only. Discussion should emphasize model‑derived findings rather than AI text confirmation.  \n3. **Ablation and Sensitivity** – Demonstrate contribution of each component: FS‑Grad‑CAM, patch ranking factors, and hybrid fusion, ideally with measurable improvement.  \n4. **Method transparency** – Provide clear mathematical formulation for the ranking function `f(·)` and weighting scheme; otherwise the method is not reproducible.  \n5. **Visualization and clarity** – Condense definitions, properly label equations, unify notation, and illustrate the pipeline with one concise figure.  \n6. **Statistical rigor** – Report classification performance with standard deviation over multiple splits and include significance tests.  \n7. **Broader applicability** – Evaluate on at least one non‑brain dataset or discuss generalization to other modalities.  \n\n5. **Minor Comments**\n- Grammar and style require editing for conciseness.  \n- Check repeated references (e.g., Zhou et al. 2024a/b).  \n- Ensure consistent variable naming in equations.  \n- Figures should have readable fonts and color legends.  \n- Provide code/parameter details in Supplementary Material.  \n\n6. **Overall Recommendation:**  \n**Major Revision (borderline below TMI novelty threshold).**  \nWhile the problem is relevant and the approach is conceptually coherent, the paper in current form lacks quantitative evidence, clear methodological novelty, and professional presentation required for *IEEE TMI*. If the authors provide rigorous comparative validation, remove unscientific elements, and substantially clarify exposition, it might reach publishable quality.\n\n7. **Confidence Level:** 4/5 – High confidence in assessment based on domain familiarity with deep‑learning explainability and medical imaging methods.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Statement to the Editor:**  \nThis manuscript tackles an important problem—explainable 3D deep learning in neuroimaging—through a highly detailed but somewhat convoluted ranking‑based approach. Its novelty is moderate and technical rigor insufficient for immediate acceptance at *IEEE TMI*, but with major revision focusing on quantitative and methodological soundness, it could evolve into a useful contribution to interpretability in medical imaging.",

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper addresses explainability challenges in 3D medical imaging by proposing a novel ranking method for 3D image blocks. The approach combines a new FS-Grad-CAM method with feature selection to generate explainable 2D heatmaps, followed by a 2D patch ranking algorithm using five informative matrices (feature distribution, feature ranking, average feature ranking, heatmap activation, and heatmap strength matrices). The core contribution is a hybrid 3D image block ranking algorithm that integrates axial, coronal, and sagittal patch rankings to create Block Ranking Maps (BRMs). The method is evaluated on ADNI dataset (982 3D brain images) for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis and an autism dataset (286 3D images), achieving testing accuracies of 0.9309-0.9897. Results show that top-ranked blocks correspond to brain regions associated with AD and autism diagnosis, verified through ChatGPT and literature citations. The hybrid BRM enables visualization across three anatomical views for medical interpretation.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical notation inconsistencies and unclear formulations**\n  - Definition 6 appears twice (lines 153 and 162) with different content, creating confusion about heatmap count matrix versus average feature ranking matrix\n  - Equation complexity in Definition 5 (lines 147-150) with floor division notation µ = ⌊Ip/n⌋ lacks clear explanation of how feature index mapping works\n  - The monotonically non-decreasing function θij = f(dij, r⁰ij, r̄ij, uij, sij) in Algorithm 1 (line 225) is never explicitly defined, making reproducibility impossible\n\n• **Insufficient experimental validation and comparison**\n  - No comparison with existing 3D explainability methods beyond brief mentions of 3DGradCAM (line 176), limiting assessment of relative performance\n  - Evaluation relies heavily on subjective verification through ChatGPT and literature matching (Tables 1-2, pages 7-9) rather than quantitative explainability metrics\n  - Testing accuracies vary significantly (0.9309-0.9897, line 317) across axial/coronal/sagittal views without explanation of this variance or its impact on final rankings\n\n• **Methodological complexity without clear justification**\n  - The five-factor ranking approach (Algorithm 1, lines 216-228) lacks ablation studies showing individual factor contributions or necessity\n  - Multiple feature selection methods are combined sequentially (Chi2, mutual_info_classif, f_regression, f_classif, RFE, lines 350-356) without justification for this specific ordering\n  - Hybrid ranking requires \"different conditions\" (Algorithm 3, line 296) but these conditions are not systematically defined or validated\n\n• **Limited scope and generalizability concerns**\n  - Evaluation limited to brain imaging applications (AD and autism) without demonstration on other organ systems or pathologies\n  - Dataset preprocessing constraints (resizing to 64×64×64, extracting middle slices 22-41, lines 307-309) may not generalize to clinical workflows\n  - Heavy reliance on \"ebrains\" software tool for brain region identification (line 339) creates dependency on specific external tools\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Clarify and standardize mathematical formulations**\n  - Resolve the duplicate Definition 6 by renumbering and clearly distinguishing between heatmap count matrix and average feature ranking matrix concepts\n  - Provide explicit mathematical formulation for the ranking function θij = f(dij, r⁰ij, r̄ij, uij, sij) with specific weights or combination rules\n  - Add detailed explanation of the feature index mapping process in Definition 5, including worked examples showing how µ values translate to spatial coordinates\n\n• **Strengthen experimental validation framework**\n  - Include quantitative comparisons with at least 2-3 existing 3D explainability methods using standard metrics like localization accuracy or faithfulness scores\n  - Replace subjective ChatGPT verification with established ground truth datasets or expert radiologist annotations for brain region validation\n  - Investigate and explain the accuracy variance across anatomical views, potentially through cross-validation or statistical significance testing\n\n• **Justify and validate methodological design choices**\n  - Conduct ablation studies removing individual factors from the five-factor ranking to demonstrate each component's necessity and contribution\n  - Provide theoretical or empirical justification for the specific sequential ordering of feature selection methods, or compare against alternative orderings\n  - Define the \"different conditions\" in Algorithm 3 systematically and validate their contribution to ranking stability through sensitivity analysis\n\n• **Expand evaluation scope and reduce external dependencies**\n  - Demonstrate method applicability on non-brain imaging datasets (lung, liver, or cardiac imaging) to establish broader medical imaging utility\n  - Evaluate performance under different preprocessing parameters (various resizing dimensions, slice selection strategies) to assess robustness\n  - Reduce dependency on \"ebrains\" software by incorporating alternative brain atlases or developing atlas-independent validation approaches",

The approach integrates feature selection with Grad-CAM to generate explainable heatmaps, and employs a hybrid 3D image block ranking algorithm to identify top-ranked blocks associated with important brain areas relevant to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and autism diagnosis. The authors demonstrate their method using the ADNI dataset and a separate dataset for autism, showing promising results in identifying key brain regions linked to these conditions.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While the proposed method introduces a unique approach to integrating feature selection with Grad-CAM for 3D image block ranking, the manuscript could benefit from a clearer differentiation from existing methods. Specifically, the authors should discuss how their approach compares to other recent advancements in explainable AI and feature ranking in medical imaging. This would help readers understand the novelty and potential advantages of the proposed method.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is primarily conducted using the ADNI dataset and a smaller dataset for autism. While these datasets are well-known, the evaluation could be strengthened by including additional datasets or modalities to validate the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method. Additionally, the manuscript could benefit from a comparison against state-of-the-art methods for 3D image block ranking and explainability in medical imaging.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript mentions several related works but does not provide detailed comparisons with recent methods that integrate feature selection and explainability in medical imaging. Including comparative analyses with these methods would provide a clearer picture of the method's performance and contributions.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The manuscript states that the code will be made available, but there are gaps in the methodological details necessary for reproducibility. For instance, the manuscript lacks clear descriptions of the preprocessing steps, hyperparameter settings, and the exact implementation of the feature selection and ranking algorithms. Providing comprehensive details in supplementary material or a dedicated section would significantly enhance reproducibility.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 2 and 3 are dense and could benefit from additional labeling or simplification to improve clarity.\n   \n2. Terminology: There are inconsistencies in the notation used for defining the feature selection and ranking processes. Clarifying these definitions and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the manuscript would improve readability.\n\n3. Definitions: Some of the mathematical definitions are overly complex and could be simplified or explained more clearly to aid comprehension.\n\n4. Typographical Errors: Minor typographical errors such as \"saggital\" instead of \"sagittal\" should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical imaging: enhancing the explainability and interpretability of 3D CNN models. The proposed hybrid 3D image block ranking algorithm shows promise in identifying key brain regions relevant to AD and autism diagnosis. However, the evaluation could be strengthened by including additional datasets and comparative analyses with recent methods. While the method has potential, the reproducibility of the approach needs improvement due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, the manuscript demonstrates an innovative approach, but further validation and clarification are necessary to meet the standards expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor Revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis, broaden the validation across datasets and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

How could biological or mechanistic understanding arise from generative models in your context? Can you expand and provide a stronger motivation for this idea?\n2. You mention that \"GANs often struggle with generating coherent latent representations.\" Since GANs do not inherently produce latent representations in the same way as e.g. Variational Autoencoders, could you clarify what \"coherent latent representations\" means in the context of GANs, and how this specifically relates to your proposed method's advantages?\n3. The claim that multiple color channels can be treated as distinct modalities is not clearly explained in my opinion but is crucial to the suggested method. Do you have examples from related work where color channels have been treated as distinct modalities? Could you explain the biological basis for considering cell and nucleus channels as separate modalities?\n4. In Equation 1, are the variables h,w,d the same dimensions as H,W,D? If not, what is their relationship? Similarly, in Equation 2, the depth dimension d seems to be omitted—was this intentional or a typo? Please add a brief explanation of these variables and their relationships directly after the equations.\n5. How does the simultaneous recovery of both channels relate specifically to latent diffusion? Can you provide a specific example or illustration of how the simultaneous recovery process works in your model, and how it differs from standard latent diffusion approaches?\n6. What is the reason for using unquantized embeddings in your framework? If they drift from the codebook vectors, how does this affect the model, and what is the underlying motivation?\n7. In Equation 12, the variable t should be defined. Additionally, in Equation 13, what exactly is μ_θ_cn(⋅) computing—only the mean or is there an associated variance? If not, what is the variance of your Gaussian?\n8. There is an existing WNet in medical imaging literature [1]. To avoid confusion, would you consider renaming your model?\n9. Can you provide more precise details about your dual-channel 3D architecture, perhaps with references or a schematic in the supplementary material?\n10. On page 6, you state that attention mechanisms are \"strategically placed\" to focus on regions of interest. Could you elaborate on the strategy behind their placement and how regions of interest are determined?\n11. The numerical differences in Table 1 are hard to interpret without context. Could you explain or hint to what these differences mean in terms of image quality and their significance in your application? Can you provide a brief interpretation guide for the FID and MMD scores, perhaps indicating what range of differences would be considered significant in this context? You could also include a qualitative comparison of images corresponding to different score ranges to help readers understand the practical implications of these differences.\n12. Could you provide more context about the ResNet50 model used—for instance, what type of medical images it was trained on?\n\n**Additional Feedback for Improvement:**\n\n- In Figure 1, please explain what the rows and columns represent to enhance understanding.\n- In the introduction, you mention that \"single-cell data is often high-dimensional and inconsistent in size.\" Could you clarify whether this inconsistency refers to the images, cells, biological structures, or image resolutions?\n- In the Related Work section, the statement about discriminative frameworks needing a \"deep understanding of the underlying input distribution\" is unclear. Providing an example or reference could help clarify this point.\n- It might be beneficial to first introduce and describe the dataset before delving into implementation details like volume padding.\n- Please specify the size and resolution of the microscopy images. Are the single-cell images crops from larger stacks, or are they the direct output from the microscope?\n- Consider citing relevant works such as the 3D U-Net architecture [2] to situate your work within the existing literature.\n- The conclusion would be stronger if it discussed potential methodological developments and acknowledged limitations of the current approach.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 6\n\n### Confidence: 4",

Clarifying the biological or mechanistic insight that could emerge from generative modeling would strengthen the paper.  \n2. Several methodological choices lack adequate motivation or description—for example, the use of VQGANs and how unquantized embeddings influence the model.  \n3. Key equations (e.g., Equations 1, 2, 12, 13) contain undefined variables and inconsistencies in notation (e.g., h,w,d vs. H,W,D, missing depth term, undefined t). These should be clearly defined and related.  \n4. The claim that multiple color channels represent distinct modalities is not sufficiently justified. Related literature or biological reasoning should support this assumption.  \n5. The relationship between simultaneous dual-channel recovery and latent diffusion processes requires a more explicit conceptual and empirical explanation.  \n6. The placement strategy of attention mechanisms and the design of the dual-channel 3D architecture need clearer description, possibly with a schematic.  \n7. Quantitative results (Table 1) lack interpretability—additional context for FID and MMD score differences, or qualitative visual examples, would be helpful.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify Figure 1’s layout (rows/columns).  \n- Specify image sizes, resolutions, and whether volumes are cropped or raw outputs.  \n- Introduce the dataset before implementation details.  \n- Clarify ambiguous statements, e.g., “single-cell data inconsistencies” and “deep understanding of the input distribution.”  \n- Include references such as 3D U‑Net to situate the method.  \n- Consider renaming the model to avoid confusion with existing “WNet” architectures.  \n- Minor language imprecision throughout should be revised for clarity.\n\n**Summary Paragraph**  \nIn terms of **significance**, the work tackles an important problem in microscopy image synthesis. **Innovation** lies in coupling multi-channel diffusion, but the biological and conceptual motivation require reinforcement. The **evaluation** shows numerical gains, yet lacks interpretive depth and qualitative context. **Reproducibility** would benefit from clearer presentation of equations, architectural details, dataset description, and implementation parameters. Strengths include topic relevance and promising results; weaknesses concern motivation, clarity, and methodological completeness.\n\n**Decision Recommendation**  \n**Recommendation: Major Revision.**  \nSubstantial clarification of the biological context, methodological details, and evaluation interpretation is necessary before reconsideration.",

The methodological emphasis on multichannel latent diffusion and inter-channel consistency places it squarely within TMI’s methodological domain, particularly under *imaging physics/AI-based image formation, synthesis, and reconstruction*.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level – Moderate to Strong**\n   - The **“library of codebooks”** for separate biological channels combined with a **multichannel diffusion stage** is a novel integration not previously reported in 3D cell imagery synthesis.\n   - The pragmatic innovation lies in demonstrating *joint-channel generative modeling* for cell and nucleus morphology under drug perturbations.\n   - While the technical blocks (VQGAN, DDPM, UNet) are established, their combination for *multichannel 3D biological imaging* is distinctive and offers generalizable methodological value.\n   - Novelty is more architectural and conceptual rather than theoretical; however, it is sufficient for TMI if rigorously validated.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor – Good but with Gaps**\n   - Experiments are systematic: dataset description is clear; baselines and metrics are standard (FID, MMD using Med3D features).\n   - Implementation details and ablations are comprehensive.\n   - Missing aspects: uncertainty quantification, statistical significance testing, and evaluation of biological validity beyond pixel-level similarity (e.g., morphological metrics or expert scoring).

Summary**  \nThe manuscript, *“Build Your Own Cell: Diffusion Models for Multichannel 3D Microscopy Image Generation,”* introduces BYOC — a generative framework combining VQGAN encoding with a multichannel 3D diffusion process. The model uses independent codebooks for each biological channel (cell, nucleus) and jointly denoises these latent spaces via a dual-channel 3D UNet in the diffusion loop. Evaluations on a 7k-cell light-sheet fluorescence dataset of drug-treated melanoma cells demonstrate that BYOC outperforms GAN-based and diffusion-based baselines (HA-GAN, α-GAN, MedicalDiffusion) on quantitative similarity metrics (FID, MMD) and yields visually realistic multi-channel 3D reconstructions. Ablation experiments confirm the benefit of channel-specific codebooks for morphological consistency.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological contribution integrating vector quantization and conditional diffusion into a multichannel 3D framework.\n- Comprehensive experimental setup with multiple baselines and ablation studies.\n- Strong qualitative demonstrations of biologically faithful reconstructions across different drug treatments.\n- Potentially impactful for in-silico high-throughput phenotyping and drug-screening applications.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Biological validation remains limited to visual inspection and distribution-level metrics; lacks expert annotation or morphological feature comparison.\n- Evaluation confined to one cell line and specific drug treatments — limited generalizability.\n- No uncertainty analysis or robustness study (e.g., to noise, resolution changes).\n- Insufficient discussion of computational scalability and inference time, relevant for translational use.\n- Ethical/compliance clarifications are minimal (dataset license, data sharing, human/animal sample policy).\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Validation Beyond Distribution Metrics:**  \n   Extend evaluation with domain-relevant morphological descriptors (e.g., cell/nucleus volume ratios, shape descriptors) or expert morphological score comparisons. This would strengthen biomedical relevance.  \n2. **Dataset and Compliance Clarification:**  \n   Include explicit details on dataset availability, ethical approval (if needed for biological specimens), and licensing terms.  \n3. **Code and Reproducibility:**  \n   Confirm that training and inference code (VQGAN + DDPM pipeline) will be made available; current placeholder link is insufficient for TMI reproducibility standards.  \n4. **Generalizability and Scalability:**  \n   Discuss limitations for other modalities (e.g., confocal, electron microscopy) and computational resource demands.  \n5. **Quantitative Uncertainty and Repeatability:**  \n   Consider assessing variance across multiple random seeds or training repeats to ensure stability given small batch sizes.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Correct typographical inconsistencies (e.g., “D IFFUSION,” “C ¸ ic ¸ek”) and unify capitalization.  \n- Figure numbering and captions should be concise and self-contained.  \n- Include clear axis labels and units for all quantitative plots.  \n- Reference formatting should adhere to IEEE style (currently hybrid arXiv/journal forms).  \n- Clarify how 3D FID/MMD was computed (feature extraction pipeline).\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation – Major Revision**  \nThe work presents a promising, methodologically meaningful step forward in 3D multichannel biomedical image generation, fitting IEEE TMI’s methodological innovation scope. However, additional experimental validation and stronger reproducibility/ethical transparency are required before acceptance.\n\n**7.

The authors evaluate their method on over 7,083 metastatic melanoma cells treated with three different drugs, demonstrating superior performance compared to baselines including MedicalDiffusion, HA-GAN, and W-GAN across FID and MMD metrics (Table 1).

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\n### This manuscript introduces \"Build Your Own Cell\" (BYOC), a novel framework for generating high-resolution, biologically realistic 3D cellular structures using a combination of vector quantisation and diffusion models. The framework is designed to handle multichannel volumetric data, specifically focusing on the simultaneous synthesis of cell and nucleus structures under different drug treatments. The authors demonstrate that BYOC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of morphological consistency, structural realism, and fine-grained detail preservation. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for addressing the challenges of multichannel 3D cellular data synthesis is clearly articulated.\n\n###\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The manuscript presents a compelling approach for multichannel 3D cellular structure synthesis, but it lacks a thorough discussion of how this work stands apart from existing literature on multimodal diffusion models and multichannel generative frameworks. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison with recent works that have explored similar problems, such as those mentioned in the related work section.\n   \n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted on a single dataset of drug-treated melanoma cells, which limits the generalizability of the findings. While the authors demonstrate superior performance on this dataset, broader validation across different cell types and treatment conditions is necessary to establish the robustness and versatility of BYOC. Additionally, the authors should consider including a more diverse set of metrics beyond FID and MMD to further substantiate the claims of enhanced realism and structural fidelity.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares BYOC with several baseline models, including HA-GAN, W-GAN, α-GAN, and MedicalDiffusion. However, the inclusion of more recent diffusion-based methods, such as those specifically designed for 3D medical image generation, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. The authors should also discuss the limitations of these baseline models in the context of multichannel 3D cellular data synthesis.\n\n4. Reproducibility: The authors mention that the project repository will be made available, but the description of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters is somewhat incomplete. Providing a detailed and structured documentation of these aspects is crucial for ensuring reproducibility. Additionally, the authors should include a clear statement regarding the availability of the code and data.\n\n###\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figure Clarity: Figures 4A and 4B are cluttered and could benefit from a more organized layout, such as separating the ground truth, MedicalDiffusion, and BYOC samples into distinct subplots.\n2. Notation Consistency: The notation used for the diffusion process (e.g., \\( \\alpha_t \\), \\( \\beta_t \\)) is sometimes inconsistent, which can confuse readers. Standardizing the notation would improve clarity.\n3. Acronym Definitions: Some acronyms, such as \"L1 loss,\" are used without initial definition. Providing definitions for all acronyms would enhance readability.\n4. Typographical Issues: There are several typographical errors throughout the manuscript, such as \"k-spacce\" (page 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (page 7). These should be corrected.\n\n###\n\n## Summary Paragraph\n(focusing on 4 TMI Editorial Criteria)\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: synthesising high-resolution, biologically realistic 3D cellular structures. The proposed BYOC framework, which combines vector quantisation and diffusion models, is technically innovative and demonstrates promising results in terms of morphological consistency and structural fidelity. However, the evaluation is limited to a single dataset and lacks broader validation across different cell types and treatment conditions, which weakens the claims of generalizability. The reproducibility of the approach is also somewhat uncertain due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, while the idea has promise, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n###\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand the comparative analysis to include more recent diffusion-based methods, strengthen validation across diverse datasets and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated promising performance in chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. To enhance human-computer interaction, several studies have incorporated radiologists' eye gaze, typically through heatmaps or textual prompts. However, these methods often overlook the sequential order of eye movements, which could provide valuable insights by highlighting both the areas of interest and the order in which they are examined. In this work, we propose a novel approach called RadEyeVideo that integrates radiologists’ eye-fixation data as a video sequence, capturing both the temporal and spatial dynamics of their gaze. The video, featuring a red gaze point overlaid on CXR images, emphasizes regions of focused attention during interpretation. We evaluate this method in CXR report generation and disease diagnosis using three general-domain, open-source LVLMs with a video input capabilities. When prompted with eye-gaze videos, model performance improves by up to 25.4% on Impression generation task and on average 7.9% for all tasks using scaled evaluation metrics. Our approach enhanced open-domain LVLM models, when combined with exemplar reports for in-context learning, outperform medical models as well as those specifically trained for CXR report generation on the benchmark dataset. This work highlights that domain expert's knowledge (eye-gaze information in this case), when effectively integrated with LVLMs, can significantly enhance general-domain models' capabilities in clinical tasks, pointing out a new effective approach of utilising LVLMs in healthcare and beyond.",

The authors evaluated the effectiveness of this approach in chest X-ray report generation and disease diagnosis tasks using large vision-language models (LVLMs) with video input capabilities. Results show that incorporating eye-gaze video prompts improved model performance by 25.4% on the Impression generation task, with an average performance increase of 7.9% across all tasks.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The RadEyeVideo method converts radiologists’ eye-tracking data into video sequences for use in chest X-ray report generation and diagnostic tasks, significantly enhancing the performance of general large vision-language models (LVLMs). Experimental results indicate a 25.4% improvement in the Impression generation task and an average improvement of 7.9% across all tasks, outperforming models specifically designed for medical applications.\n2. Comprehensive Evaluation of Eye-Tracking Prompting Methods: This study presents the first thorough evaluation of various eye-tracking integration techniques, including static heatmaps, eye-tracking text prompts, and dynamic video prompts. The results indicate that RadEyeVideo outperforms the other methods in terms of diagnostic accuracy and clinical relevance, establishing a new standard for eye-tracking data prompts.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n- Methodological Clarity: a) The paper lacks sufficient detail about the video prompt integration process, particularly how the video information is encoded and processed by the LVLMs. The technical implementation of combining video sequences with textual prompts could be more thoroughly explained. b) There's limited discussion of potential alternatives to full video sequence processing that might achieve similar results with lower computational costs.\n\n- Data Collection and Generalizability Limitations: a) The methodology requires synchronized eye-tracking data collection during radiologist readings, which is resource-intensive and difficult to scale. b) The approach may not generalize well to scenarios where real-time eye-tracking data is unavailable or impractical to collect. c) The current evaluation is limited to a relatively small dataset (2,298 CXR images), raising questions about broader applicability.\n\n- Computational Efficiency Concerns: The direct use of complete eye-tracking video sequences as prompts likely increases computational overhead significantly. While the authors mention sampling k frames (typically 16) from the total sequence, there's limited analysis of the computational trade-offs or optimal sampling strategies. The method may be computationally prohibitive for real-time clinical applications.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease address the concern raised in weakness part.\nMoreover, there are some questions may help you to address the weakness.\n1) What is the computational overhead of processing video prompts compared to traditional image-only or text-only prompts?\n2) Have you explored more efficient alternatives to using complete video sequences, such as key frame selection or compressed representations? 3) How do you envision this approach being implemented in real-world clinical settings where real-time eye-tracking data may not be available? 4) Have you considered alternative methods for generating synthetic eye-tracking data that could make the approach more broadly applicable? 5)\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 5",

The study reports substantial performance improvements—25.4% in the Impression generation task and an average of 7.9% across all tasks—demonstrating the potential impact of incorporating dynamic eye-gaze information. Overall, the paper addresses an interesting idea with well-structured experiments but has methodological and generalizability concerns that require clarification.  \n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Methodological Clarity:** The paper does not sufficiently explain how video prompts are integrated and processed within the LVLMs. Details about video encoding, temporal representation, and combination with textual prompts are limited. Greater transparency on architectural choices, training setup, and data flow is needed to ensure reproducibility.  \n2. **Alternative and Efficiency Analysis:** There is minimal discussion of computational trade-offs associated with full video sequence processing. Explorations of lighter alternatives—such as key-frame selection, compressed representations, or partial sequences—could inform efficiency and practicality while maintaining performance.  \n3. **Data Collection and Generalizability:** The method depends on synchronized eye-tracking data collected during radiologist readings, which is expensive and challenging to scale. The study’s reliance on a relatively small dataset (2,298 CXRs) further limits generalizability. The approach’s applicability in clinical scenarios without real-time eye-tracking data should be discussed.  \n4. **Computational Burden:** Although the authors use frame sampling (typically 16 frames), no quantitative analysis of computational cost versus benefit is provided. This raises concerns about feasibility for real-time diagnostic use.\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- Clarify the process of selecting “k” frames for input and justify sampling choices.  \n- Ensure consistent notation and acronym definitions (e.g., LVLM).  \n- Provide additional details in figures or appendices to illustrate video prompt construction.  \n\n**Summary Paragraph (TMI Criteria)**  \nThe submission offers *significant* potential by introducing a data-driven mechanism that bridges human visual attention with multimodal model reasoning.

Red fixation points are superimposed on CXR images to highlight the areas that doctors pay attention to, so as to dynamically present the doctor's eye movement path. Improve the ability of radiologists or AI models to diagnose chest diseases by providing rich contextual information.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 3\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed method, RadEyeVideo, combines video, text, and eye movement data to realize the fusion of multi-modal information and improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis.\n2. The authors conducted a thorough assessment of various eye-tracking integration techniques, providing strong empirical support for their claims.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. In Figure 2, the authors illustrate different prompting methods; however, the figure does not clearly distinguish between the use of text descriptions and video inputs. This ambiguity makes it challenging to understand whether the authors used text descriptions to guide the prompt along with the video input or if they only provided video data. \n2. The author's experiments conducted on only one dataset are clearly insufficient in terms of persuasiveness. This limitation may affect the generalizability and applicability of the research findings. To enhance the credibility of the study, it is recommended that the authors validate their approach on different datasets.\n3. When the authors use radiologist's eye-tracking sequences as video input, this approach does enhance the model's understanding of prior knowledge in the diagnostic reading process to a certain extent. However, converting eye-tracking data into video format substantially increases the number of tokens, leading to significant computational resource consumption and longer inference times for the model.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. The RadEyeVideo method integrates the eye movement data of the radiologist as a video sequence to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of his gaze. However, the article does not explain in detail how this video sequence is specifically generated, for example, how the eye movement data is sampled and converted into video frames, and how these frames contain temporal and spatial information.\n2. In Section 2.3 INPUT REPRESENTATION, to fit the input requirements of LVLM, the authors uniformly sampled the video sequence and selected 16 frames as inputs. However, the article does not explain why 16 frames were chosen and whether this choice had a significant impact on model performance. In addition, whether the impact of using more or fewer frames on model performance has been explored is also a question worth exploring. This helps to further understand the effect of video data length and quality on model performance.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 4",

        "text": "**Phase 1 – Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n**1. Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \nThe manuscript presents *RadEyeVideo*, a method to incorporate radiologists’ eye‑tracking data into large vision‑language models (LVLMs) for chest X‑ray report generation and diagnosis. The work sits at the interface of computer vision, multimodal machine learning, and medical imaging.  It proposes a new data representation (eye‑gaze videos) and evaluates several multimodal prompting strategies.  \n✅ **Within scope** of *IEEE TMI*: it proposes a methodological innovation for human‑in‑the‑loop medical image analysis with structured experiments on image–language models.\n\n**2. Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe primary novelty lies in encoding gaze fixation sequences as *video prompts* to capture temporal order, contrasting with prior static heatmaps or textual cues. While use of eye‑tracking data for medical imaging AI is known, extending it to video‑based prompts for LVLMs is a distinctive but *incremental* conceptual step rather than a fundamental algorithmic advance. The contribution is therefore methodological at the data‑representation and prompting‑design level, not at the level of new model architectures or learning theory.  \nOverall novelty: **moderate**—potentially interesting for the community if empirical gains are validated more rigorously.\n\n**3. Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \n- **Dataset**: built from MIMIC‑Eye (≈2.3 k images). The authors acknowledge limited sample size and potential train/test overlap; nonetheless, methodology to mitigate bias is described (alpha/beta splits).  \n- **Baselines**: several state‑of‑the‑art LVLMs, including medical and general‑domain ones, are compared.  \n- **Metrics**: both lexical (ROUGE, BERTScore) and radiology‑specific (CheXbert, RadGraph, RaTEScore) used with a scaled‑score composite.  \n- **Ablation**: frame‑count, gaze filtering, and in‑context learning were examined.  \n- **Weaknesses**: limited statistical analysis—no confidence intervals or significance testing; clinical relevance of improvements not formally studied; dataset imbalance remains; ethical statement minimal. Reproducibility seems adequate (code indicated).  \n\n**4. Clarity and Presentation**  \nManuscript is generally well organized, with clear figures, equations, and tables. Wording is occasionally verbose; minor grammatical inconsistencies appear but readability is high. Quantitative results are exhaustive, perhaps excessively so for main text.\n\n**5. Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nData use complies with MIMIC‑Eye licensing; anonymization stated. Code availability noted. No patient‑identifiable content.

        "text": "## Synopsis of the paper\n\nThis paper introduces RadEyeVideo, a novel approach that integrates radiologists' eye-tracking data as video sequences to enhance large vision-language models (LVLMs) for chest X-ray analysis. Unlike existing methods that use static heatmaps or textual prompts, RadEyeVideo captures both spatial and temporal dynamics of radiologists' gaze patterns by creating videos with red dots overlaid on CXR images, where dot duration reflects fixation time (Section 2.2, Equations 1-3). The authors evaluate three general-domain video-capable LVLMs (LongVA, VideoLLaMA2, LLaVA-OneVision) on report generation and diagnosis tasks using the MIMIC-Eye dataset (2,298 CXR images with eye-gaze annotations). Results show RadEyeVideo achieves up to 25.4% improvement on Impression generation and 7.9% average improvement across all tasks compared to baseline methods (Table 3). The enhanced general-domain models outperform specialized medical LVLMs like CheXagent and CXR-LLaVA on benchmark datasets.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Limited Dataset Scale and Generalizability**: The evaluation relies on a small dataset of only 2,298 images from MIMIC-Eye, with the beta split containing merely 92 images for robust evaluation (Table 1, Page 6). This severely limits statistical power and generalizability claims. The authors acknowledge this limitation (Page 10) but proceed with evaluation on both training and test splits, potentially introducing data contamination issues that could inflate reported performance gains.\n\n• **Inconsistent Mathematical Formulation and Implementation Details**: The video construction methodology lacks precision in several key aspects. Equation 2 defines frame rate as 10 fps but provides conflicting information about total frame calculation (Fi = ti × fps vs Fi = ti × 10). The uniform sampling strategy in Equation 3 uses floor division that could lead to frame loss, and the fixed 5-pixel gaze radius lacks justification or sensitivity analysis. The filtering criterion using average fixation duration (Equation 1) appears arbitrary without empirical validation.\n\n• **Weak Experimental Design and Evaluation Methodology**: The scaled evaluation metric based on CheXagent performance (Equation 7) creates circular reasoning since CheXagent is simultaneously used as both a baseline competitor and the normalization reference. The evaluation lacks statistical significance testing despite small sample sizes, and the temperature parameter of 0 eliminates randomness assessment. The choice of 16 frames appears arbitrary, supported only by a limited ablation study (Figure 4) without theoretical justification.\n\n• **Insufficient Baseline Comparisons and Analysis**: The paper compares against limited eye-gaze integration methods and lacks comparison with recent human-AI collaboration approaches in medical imaging. The heatmap implementation details are poorly described (Page 7), making reproduction difficult. Performance improvements show high variance across models and tasks (Table 3), with VideoLLaMA2 showing negligible improvement (0.6%) and inconsistent patterns that undermine the claimed superiority of the video approach.\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Expand Dataset Scale and Validation Strategy**: Conduct evaluation on larger, more diverse datasets beyond MIMIC-Eye to establish generalizability. Implement proper cross-validation with completely held-out test sets to avoid contamination issues. Include multi-institutional validation data to demonstrate robustness across different radiologist populations and imaging protocols.\n\n• **Clarify and Validate Mathematical Formulations**: Provide consistent and precise mathematical notation throughout, particularly for frame rate calculations and sampling strategies. Conduct sensitivity analysis for key hyperparameters including gaze radius size, filtering thresholds, and frame numbers. Justify the average-duration filtering criterion through empirical analysis of gaze pattern significance and provide theoretical foundation for uniform sampling approach.\n\n• **Strengthen Experimental Design with Rigorous Statistics**: Replace the circular CheXagent-based scaling metric with independent evaluation standards or multiple reference points. Include statistical significance testing with confidence intervals and effect size calculations. Implement multiple temperature settings to assess model reliability and add cross-model validation to strengthen claims about video-based prompting superiority.\n\n• **Comprehensive Baseline Analysis and Methodological Transparency**: Include comparisons with recent human-AI collaboration methods in medical imaging and provide detailed implementation specifications for all baseline approaches. Conduct thorough ablation studies examining individual components of the video creation pipeline and provide qualitative analysis of failure cases to better understand method limitations and boundary conditions.",

        "text": "## Opening Paragraph\nThis manuscript introduces RadEyeVideo, a novel approach that integrates radiologists' eye-gaze data as video sequences to enhance general-domain large vision-language models (LVLMs) for chest X-ray (CXR) analysis. By capturing both the spatial and temporal dynamics of eye movements, the proposed method aims to improve the performance of LVLMs in CXR report generation and diagnosis. The authors evaluate their approach using three general-domain LVLMs and demonstrate improvements in performance metrics compared to traditional methods that use heatmaps or textual prompts. The manuscript is well-written, and the motivation for incorporating sequential eye-gaze data is clearly articulated.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: The manuscript claims that RadEyeVideo offers significant improvements over existing methods by integrating eye-gaze data as video sequences. However, it is not entirely clear how this approach differentiates itself from recent works that also incorporate temporal information. The authors need to provide a more thorough comparison with related works that have explored sequential eye-gaze integration to establish the novelty of their contribution.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The evaluation is conducted using a relatively small dataset (MIMIC-Eye) that may not be fully representative of real-world CXR scenarios. The authors should consider expanding the evaluation to include a more diverse set of CXR images and radiologists to better assess the generalizability of their approach. Additionally, the use of only the alpha and beta splits from the MIMIC-CXR dataset might introduce biases, and the authors should discuss potential limitations arising from this choice.\n\n3. Comparisons: The baseline comparisons are limited to a few general-domain LVLMs and do not include state-of-the-art medical LVLMs specifically trained for CXR analysis. Including such comparisons would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of RadEyeVideo's performance relative to specialized models. Moreover, the authors should consider including a wider range of performance metrics to provide a more nuanced assessment of their method.\n\n4. Reproducibility: While the authors mention that the code is provided in the supplementary materials, the description of the training protocols, preprocessing steps, and model hyperparameters is somewhat incomplete. Detailed documentation of these aspects is necessary to ensure that the results can be independently reproduced.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 3 and 6 could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions to enhance readability and clarity.\n\n2. Section 2.1: The introduction of notation in Section 2.1 is not sufficiently explained, especially regarding the forward operator, which is denoted inconsistently.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms (e.g., \"R=4\") are used without definition, which can confuse readers unfamiliar with the terminology.\n\n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors, such as \"k-spacce\" (p. 6) and \"undersampling maskes\" (p. 7), should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant and clinically relevant challenge: enhancing the performance of general-domain LVLMs in CXR analysis through the integration of radiologists' eye-gaze data as video sequences. The proposed method, RadEyeVideo, demonstrates technical innovation by capturing both spatial and temporal aspects of eye movements, which can provide valuable insights into the decision-making process of radiologists. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited by the dataset size and the lack of comparisons with state-of-the-art medical LVLMs, which weakens the claims of significance and generalizability. The reproducibility of the approach is also uncertain due to incomplete methodological details. Overall, while the idea has promise, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand comparative analysis, strengthen validation across datasets and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",

Current pre-training works are unable to integrate various types of supervisions, including self-supervision and external supervision such as segmentation annotations, while they are highly valuable for medical image understanding. Therefore, in this paper, we take the first step toward exploring unifying all common types of supervisions into a pre-training framework through a same scalable way. This require the pre-training framework being both unified, for accommodating diverse data and extensible, and effective, for making heterogeneous data synergistically assist unknown downstream tasks. To this end, we propose UmiF, whose principle is that once converted into token embeddings in a unified space, all diverse supervisions can be effectively utilized via contrastive learning and mask modeling with a same way. With UmiF, we pre-train on 1.66M samples from 14 public datasets, significantly surpassing previous efforts in terms of the dataset scale. We obtain and release the UmiF model, which achieved state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, including classification, segmentation, and detection, retrieval and VQA.",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThe Authors propose UmiF, a framework that aims to unify pre-training of any arbitrary Image-Label pair to train a robust encoder for any modality. To achieve this the authors propose three tokenizers, that each allows embedding to a shared unified token space (One Image, One Text, One Image Labels/Segmentation). These image / label tokens are either left split or merged to a certain degree, before being used for SSL training through contrastive training in a CLIP'esque fashion or through a reconstruction task. \nThey train their model on a wide variety of paired pre-training datasets and evaluate it on a broad set of downstream tasks, highlighting the final performance of UmiF's method.\n\nWhile innovative, the experiments are insufficient to highlight the proposed methodology. The authors stack a) a larger pre-training dataset b) Token mixing c) Masked and Contrastive losses together and don't provide experiments that disentangle which part brings performance and which part does not. Moreover, the presentation and language used in this paper are of insufficient quality and need a lot of work.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 3\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe proposal to not only include Image-Report pairs but also Images with other Supervision signals is an interesting and to my knowledge novel premise for the medical domain. Their idea of mixing image and supervision tokens are also innovative.\nMoreover, the amount of experiments conducted is broad, highlighting the generality of the ViT feature extractor.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\nWhile the premises are highly interesting the paper in it's current form has some issues:\n1. **Stacking of contributions** Currently the authors stack a variety of things on-top and don't ablate it properly, namely a) a larger pre-training dataset b) the token mixing block and c) the multiple SSL losses. Currently, it is impossible for a reader to know if their methodology is better downstream than the competing methods, as they create a much larger training data corpus. Maybe it's the masked reconstruction component, maybe not.\n2. **Presentation** The presentation of the paper as of right now is poor. It was very hard to read, as the language quality leaves a lot of room for improvement and should be checked by an English speaker to rework the manuscript. Moreover, Fig. 1 does a bad job of explaining the method contributing to difficulties in understanding the proposed method. Figures in the appendix are badly presented: Fig. 2 text is way too large.  Table 3 does not have a caption, The description of the Image-Segment Dataset (Section A.4) is basically non-existent and should be filled accordingly. \n3. **Reproducibility** Currently the author's don't sufficiently explain their configuration of their methods. How was _r_ chosen ? In the text it is mentioned sometimes 1 and sometimes random between [0,1]. How did the authors split their data? Was there a train-test split during pre-training and fine-tuning? Was there different weightings between the losses?\n\n### Minor Points\n- The ablation of _r_ values does not contain r of 0.9 and 1.0 - It's mentioned in the text that these performed substantially worse, but I would like to have these values included in the table. Moreover this table should provide not only RSNA 1% AUC values. The downstream adaptation are just learning of a linear-layer so please provide ablations on more datasets and all values to show if the mixing of tokens actually provides a benefit.\n- The distinction between what this paper does relative to other paper's feels not well worked out. It would help a lot to see what makes this work distinct.\n- Similarities to MedUniC Paper. This paper's Table 2 is very similar to their Table 2 -- I would prefer to highlight this in the caption. \n- There are so many typos in this manuscripts. E.g. spellings of baseline methods:  MedKLIIP/MedKILP/MedKLIP. It feels like no one proof-read this paper ever.\n- The Algorithm 1 is way too text heavy. If the authors want to go into detail about the sampling of their datasets they should move this into a separate algorithm to keep readability high.\n- The authors mention the importance of sampling smaller dataset more regularly but provide no results. Would be great to see an ablation table on this claim in the appendix.\n\n### Questions\n\n- Q1: Did you ablate the importance of using the masking and the contrastive loss by themselves?\n- Q2: How was _r_ chosen?\n- Q3: Shouldn't r be symmetric around 0.5? r=0 would just flip image embeddings to supervision and the other way around. Is this correct, or if not why not? \n- Q4: Have you tried replacing the mixing with a standard masking/token drop-out layer? Would be interesting to see if one actually has to mix tokens or if the dropping of tokens provides a similar regularizing effect.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 3\n\n### Confidence: 4",

According to the paper, a positive pair is represented by \\(f1_i, f0_j\\) where i and j are indices from different data points, meaning \\(f1_i\\) and \\(f0_j\\) are from different samples. Typically, a positive pair should be \\(f1_i, f0_i\\), where both elements come from the same sample, making the current approach unclear.\n\n- **Unfair Comparisons in Downstream Tasks**: There are substantial fairness issues in the downstream task comparisons. Competing models, such as Med-Unic and MGCA, are pre-trained on datasets with 380K and 217K samples respectively, whereas this study uses 1.66 million data pairs, including 1 million images. The model’s performance advantage in downstream tasks may stem from this large data disparity, making it difficult to attribute improvements solely to the proposed pre-training strategy.\n\n- **Performance in Table 2**: In Table 2, despite using more training data and supervision than Med-Unic, the proposed model does not achieve the best performance, which raises questions about the efficiency of the approach.\n\n- **Limited Ablation Study on Parameter r**: In the ablation study on the parameter r, only 1% of the RSNA dataset is used, rather than the full dataset, and no similar experiments are conducted on other datasets. It is unclear if the chosen r value on RSNA is robust and generalizable to other tasks, as this limited evaluation does not provide strong evidence of robustness.\n\n- **Inconsistencies Between Text and Figures**: There are inconsistencies between the text and figures. For instance, the text describes vector groups as Group 1 and Group 0, but the figure labels them as Group 1 and Group 2. \n\n- **CLS Token Generation Unclear**: The generation of the CLS token information is not clearly explained.  According to the figure, the CLS token appears to be an output of the Flexible Token Grouping, but the paper does not specify how the CLS token is produced.

The authors pre-train on 1.66 million samples from 14 public datasets and evaluate results on classification, segmentation, detection, retrieval, and visual question answering tasks. Overall, the paper is clearly written, but some methodological choices and comparisons raise concerns about fairness and interpretability.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Contrastive Learning Design** – The description of positive and negative pair formation is unclear. The paper defines positive pairs across different samples \\((f1_i, f0_j)\\), whereas contrastive frameworks typically use features from the same sample \\((f1_i, f0_i)\\). This mismatch requires clarification and potentially undermines the soundness of the learning formulation.  \n2. **Fairness of Downstream Comparisons** – Competing models (e.g., Med-Unic, MGCA) are trained on substantially smaller datasets (380K and 217K samples) compared to UmiF’s 1.66 million samples. This disparity raises questions about whether observed improvements stem from methodological advantages or simply from larger data exposure.  \n3. **Performance Results (Table 2)** – Despite greater data volume and supervision, UmiF does not surpass Med-Unic in some metrics, suggesting limited efficiency or benefit from the proposed strategy.  \n4. **Ablation Study on Parameter r** – The ablation is restricted to 1% of the RSNA dataset and not replicated on other datasets. As such, the claimed generalization of the selected r value is weak.  \n5. **Inconsistencies Between Text and Figures** – Figure labels (Group 1, Group 2) do not match the text designations (Group 1, Group 0), causing confusion in interpreting the grouping mechanism.  \n6. **CLS Token Generation** – The role and derivation of the CLS token are insufficiently explained.

However, methodological ambiguity in contrastive pair design and limited ablation analysis weaken the evaluation of robustness. Comparative advantages are difficult to attribute solely to the method because of notable data imbalance. While reproducibility appears feasible based on public datasets, greater clarity in implementation details (e.g., CLS token, parameter settings) would improve confidence. The work is conceptually interesting but requires stronger experimental justification.\n\n---\n\n**Decision Recommendation:** **Major Revision**",

        "text": "### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a multi-supervision unification strategy for medical image pretraining. The method allows report, segmentation, and classification (+ some others) types of supervision to jointly train one representation. The used modality is Chest X-ray (CXR). The authors collected a large-scale dataset sourced from the public domain, reaching 1M images and 1.66M supervision labels. It is reported the model, namely, UmiF reaches SOTA for a number of downstream tasks.\n\n### Soundness: 2\n\n### Presentation: 1\n\n### Contribution: 2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The authors have gone through tremendous effort in collecting and inventorying the datasets. I can imagine the implementation wouldn't be easy to iron out the differences in the datasets and put them together to train one model. For that, I believe the significance of the paper should be pointed out.\n\n2. the benchmarking is comprehensive, ranging over the common medical image analysis tasks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n1. The clarity of the paper is a concern. Many places in the text lack proper explanation and are somewhat confusing.  For example, L230 \"This interesting design allows more diverse views and enriches the learning tasks with many possibilities, surpassing previous VL learning approaches.\", The authors should clearly state why it is interesting. What are the many possibilities? What are the other diverse views (isn't the modality just CXR)? What evidence indicates your method surpasses the previous VL learning approach?\n2. Furthermore, Sec 3.2, perhaps the most important section in the paper is not well written, I've read it a few times and I still don't believe I have grasped the exact approach. \n3. I find Figure 1 hard to follow, the quantities in Sec 3.2 should be mapped to the figure. I also don't get the colour coding in Figure 1 for those tokens. The yellow/blue/no boundary cubes are also a very confusing way of presentation.\n4. The improvement over the previous state-of-the-art is marginal around 1 point in various measurements. As the authors claim a large-scale dataset of 1.66M image-supervision pairs vs \"previous effort of mostly limited to 380K image-report pairs or 838K images\", it is worth rethinking whether the effort spent on training such a large model on the twice amount of data makes sense.\n5. The title claims \"learning robust representation for medical images ...\", medical images are not just CXR, I would recommend claiming a lesser scope unless common modalities such as MRI/CT are also used.\n6. In Sec 3.1, the authors use \"modality abstraction\", which sounds cool but I would say it is actually confusing, the procedure is a label format conversion.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease address weaknesses #2&4. The paper could use some professional editing services.\n\n### Flag For Ethics Review\n\n- No ethics review needed.\n\n### Rating: 5\n\n### Confidence: 3",

The results indicate that the UmiF model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several downstream tasks.\n\n**Major Comments:**\n1. **Clarity Issues:** The paper's clarity is insufficient, with several sections lacking adequate explanations. For instance, on line 230, the claim that the design \"allows more diverse views and enriches the learning tasks\" is vague. The authors should clarify what these views entail and present evidence for how their method surpasses previous vision-language (VL) learning approaches.\n2. **Key Section Quality:** Section 3.2, a critical part of the manuscript, is poorly articulated. Multiple readings have not clarified the specific approach, necessitating a clearer exposition.\n3. **Figure Presentation:** Figure 1 is difficult to interpret; quantities discussed in Section 3.2 should correspond more directly with the figure elements. The color coding for tokens is unclear, and the use of yellow/blue/no boundary cubes complicates the communication of ideas.\n4. **Marginal Improvements:** The reported advancement over prior state-of-the-art results is marginal, showing only about a 1-point improvement across various metrics. Given the dataset's vast scale, the authors should re-evaluate whether this investment in training a large model is justified.\n5. **Scope of Claim:** The title suggests a broad claim of \"learning robust representation for medical images.\" However, as the work focuses solely on CXR, a more accurate title should reflect this narrower scope unless other modalities like MRI or CT are incorporated.\n6. **Terminology Confusion:** The term \"modality abstraction\" used in Section 3.1 is misleading; it would be clearer to refer to it as label format conversion.\n\n**Minor Comments:**\n- The paper would benefit from professional editing services to enhance overall clarity, particularly in addressing weaknesses noted in comments 2 and 4.\n\n**Summary Paragraph:**  \nIn relation to the editorial criteria, this study demonstrates significance through its extensive dataset and comprehensive benchmarking across common medical imaging tasks. However, clarity and presentation weaknesses are significant drawbacks.

            "text": "**Opening Paragraph**  \nThe manuscript proposes a multi-supervision unification strategy for medical image pretraining, termed **UmiF**. The key contribution lies in enabling multiple supervision types—report, segmentation, and classification, among others—to jointly train a single, unified representation using chest X-ray (CXR) data. The authors assemble a large-scale dataset of approximately one million images with 1.66 million supervision labels from public sources. Experimental results suggest that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several downstream CXR tasks. While the scope and data collection effort are commendable, the manuscript’s clarity and justification of design choices require substantial improvement.\n\n---\n\n**Major Comments**  \n1. **Clarity and Explanation** – The manuscript lacks adequate detail in several places. Statements such as “enriches the learning tasks with many possibilities” (around L230) should be explicitly supported. The authors should define what constitutes “diverse views,” provide evidence for performance advantages, and explain how the approach surpasses prior vision-language methods.  \n2. **Method Description (Sec. 3.2)** – This section, central to the contribution, is difficult to follow. The exact formulation and procedural steps of the proposed method remain unclear even after multiple readings.  \n3. **Figure 1 Interpretability** – The figure is hard to interpret. The notation and quantities described in Sec. 3.2 should be directly linked to figure elements. The color coding (yellow/blue and partitioned cubes) is confusing and needs clearer explanation.  \n4. **Performance Significance** – Improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods are marginal (~1 point). Given the dataset’s significantly larger scale, the paper should discuss whether such incremental gains justify the extensive effort and computational cost.  \n5. **Scope of Claims** – The title and text refer broadly to “medical images,” but the experiments are limited to CXR. The claim should be narrowed to this modality unless evidence for other imaging types (e.g., CT, MRI) is provided.  \n6. **Terminology Precision** – The phrase “modality abstraction” (Sec. 3.1) is misleading; it appears to describe a label format conversion rather than true modality abstraction.\n\n---\n\n**Minor Comments**  \n- The manuscript would benefit from professional language editing to improve readability.  \n- Ensure consistency between textual descriptions and figure notation.  \n- Clarify visual elements and legends in all figures.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Paragraph (TMI Criteria)**  \nIn terms of **significance**, the large-scale dataset and unified training approach are valuable contributions. Regarding **innovation**, the concept of multi-supervision unification is interesting but insufficiently articulated. **Evaluation** appears comprehensive across common CXR tasks but shows only modest gains. **Reproducibility** is limited due to unclear methodological details and missing descriptions of implementation procedures.

        "text": "**Phase 1: Analytical and Scope Audit**\n\n1. **Scope & Relevance to TMI**  \n✅ The manuscript presents a methodological contribution in medical imaging: a unified pre‑training framework (UmiF) for medical image encoders that integrates multiple supervision types (self‑supervision, segmentation, classification, and vision‑language signals). This is model- and representation-learning methodology directly within TMI scope.\n\n2. **Novelty & Contribution Level**  \nThe work claims to be the first to unify four major forms of supervision in medical image pre‑training. The central innovations are (1) a unified token space for diverse modalities (image, text, segmentation mask) and (2) a “flexible token grouping” strategy enabling various contrastive and masked modeling tasks simultaneously. While the conceptual idea—unifying multimodal supervision—is inspired by recent general-domain vision‑language models (e.g., OFA, BEiT‑style unification), its systematic adaptation to heterogeneous medical datasets constitutes a meaningful advance for the domain. The degree of novelty is moderate‑to‑high for medical imaging methodology.\n\n3. **Technical and Experimental Rigor**  \nTechnical formulation is sound and internally consistent. Loss functions for contrastive and consistency learning are detailed. Experimental evaluation is broad—covering classification, segmentation, detection, VQA, and zero‑shot tasks—on public datasets totaling 1.66 M pairs. Comparisons to state‑of‑the‑art (MGCA, Med‑UniC, MRM) are appropriate. A potential concern is the uniform data harmonization using GPT‑4 translation and report generation, which may introduce bias or unverified text quality; this should be discussed more quantitatively. Reproducibility could also be strengthened by specifying tokenization vocabulary sizes, exact backbone configuration, and ablation hyperparameters.\n\n4. **Clarity and Presentation**  \nThe manuscript is generally well structured and readable. Major figures and tables are clear, though minor grammar issues remain (“to to acquire”, “being both unified, for accommodating diverse data and extensible, and effective” etc.). Sections are logically organized; however, some sentences are overly long, and acronyms (e.g., UmiF) could be introduced earlier.\n\n5. **Ethical and Reproducibility Compliance**  \nAll datasets are public, and IRB risk is minimal. Authors state intent to release code and checkpoints upon acceptance and clearly acknowledge limitations and bias risks—appropriate under TMI policy.\n\n---\n\n**Phase 2: IEEE TMI Review Report**\n\n**1. Summary**  \nThis paper proposes *UmiF*, a unified medical‑image pre‑training framework that jointly leverages self‑supervision (contrastive and mask modeling) and external supervision (text reports, captions, class labels, segmentation masks) to learn robust task‑agnostic representations. The approach converts all modalities into a shared token space via modality‑specific tokenizers and processes them through a single Vision Transformer. A flexible token‑grouping mechanism randomly partitions tokens across modalities to form paired views for contrastive learning and mask modeling, effectively fusing heterogeneous supervision types. Pre‑training on 1.66 M samples from 14 datasets, UmiF achieves consistent state‑of‑the‑art performance across five downstream tasks.\n\n**2. Strengths**\n- Clear methodological innovation in unifying diverse supervision sources under one scalable backbone.  \n- Comprehensive empirical validation across multiple downstream tasks and data‑efficiency regimes.  \n- Solid conceptual grounding linking self‑supervised and vision‑language paradigms.  \n- Demonstrates potential for generalized medical foundation models.\n\n**3. Weaknesses**\n- Limited theoretical justification for why flexible token grouping yields synergy; mostly empirical.  \n- Heavy reliance on GPT‑4‑generated or translated reports introduces potential data and linguistic bias not formally evaluated.  \n- Experiments restricted to 2D X‑ray data; unclear how easily the approach extends to other modalities (CT, MRI, pathology).  \n- Some reproducibility details (data splits, tokenizer parameters, random seeds) are missing.  \n- Writing quality could be improved for clarity and grammar.\n\n**4. Major Comments**\n1. **Clarify the contribution boundary** – Provide more explicit comparison to general-domain unified frameworks (OFA, BEiT, Painter), explaining which design changes are uniquely required for medical data.  \n2. **Quantify generated‑text quality** – Include metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, or radiologist manual ratings) to confirm the reliability of GPT‑generated translations and synthetic reports.  \n3. **Explain scalability beyond X‑ray** – Discuss adaptations needed for volumetric or multi‑channel modalities.  \n4. **Expand reproducibility details** – Document tokenizer vocabulary sizes, ViT configuration, and sampling probabilities.  \n5. **Statistical analysis** – Include standard deviation or confidence intervals for performance metrics to support claims of superiority.\n\n**5. Minor Comments**\n- Proofread for redundant words and grammatical errors.  \n- In tables, denote backbone sizes consistently (e.g., ViT‑B/16).  \n- Add visual examples showing outputs from the grouping strategy to aid intuitive understanding.  \n- Verify citation format consistency.  \n- Clarify timing and ratio of text versus mask tokens during training.\n\n**6. Overall Recommendation:** **Major Revision**  \nThe paper presents an interesting and potentially impactful methodological contribution within TMI scope. However, it requires better justification of novelty relative to existing multimodal frameworks, quantitative validation of synthetic data quality, and detailed reproducibility information. With these revisions, it could reach publishable quality.\n\n**7. Confidence Level:** 4 / 5  \n\n**Summary Decision:** *Major Revision – Methodologically promising, requires stronger experimental transparency and clarification of novelty and generalization scope.*",

The authors compile a large-scale dataset of 1.66M samples from 14 public datasets, significantly exceeding previous efforts. UmiF uses Vision Transformer as backbone and trains with both alignment loss for contrastive learning and consistency loss for mask modeling. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks including classification, segmentation, detection, retrieval, and VQA on medical imaging datasets.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n• **Mathematical formulation clarity and consistency issues**\n  - Equation 1 uses inconsistent indexing notation where positive pairs are denoted as (f1i, f0j) but the loss function ℓ(fi, fj) uses different subscript conventions without clear mapping\n  - The binary sampling strategy in Section 3.2 lacks mathematical rigor in defining the probability distribution for sampling r values beyond stating \"certain probability\" and \"randomly sampled from [0, 1]\"\n  - Equation 2's consistency loss formulation doesn't clearly specify the relationship between teacher network input Concat(Xi, Xs) and the masked student inputs X0, X1\n\n• **Insufficient technical novelty and contribution clarity**\n  - The core tokenization approach directly borrows from existing works (Section 3.1 acknowledges similarity to Wang et al., 2022b; Zhang et al., 2023) without substantial methodological innovation\n  - The flexible token grouping strategy, while presented as novel, essentially reduces to standard vision-language learning when r=1 (page 5, lines 218-223), suggesting limited conceptual advancement\n  - The unification claim is overstated given that only three modality types are handled, and the abstraction is relatively straightforward (converting coordinates to masks, labels to text templates)\n\n• **Experimental design and evaluation limitations**\n  - Table 2-5 comparisons include methods with different backbone architectures (ResNet-50 vs ViT-B/16), making performance comparisons potentially unfair without proper architectural controls\n  - The ablation study in Table 7 only examines single supervision types versus all combined, lacking systematic analysis of pairwise combinations to understand synergistic effects\n  - Zero-shot evaluation is limited to a single dataset (CXP500 with 500+ images), providing insufficient evidence for generalization claims across diverse medical imaging scenarios\n\n• **Dataset processing and experimental rigor concerns**\n  - The reliance on GPT-4 for Spanish-to-English translation and report generation (Section 2, Table 1) introduces potential biases and quality inconsistencies not adequately validated\n  - Algorithm 1 and Section 4.1 provide insufficient implementation details regarding the \"certain probability\" for r=1 setting, batch construction specifics, and convergence criteria\n  - The segmentation mask generation process (bottom of Figure 1) lacks technical details about color assignment, resolution matching, and potential information loss during coordinate-to-mask conversion\n\n## Suggestions for Improvement\n\n• **Enhance mathematical rigor and notation consistency**\n  - Standardize indexing notation throughout Equation 1 by clearly defining the relationship between batch indices i,j and the positive pair construction\n  - Provide explicit probability distributions for the flexible token grouping strategy, including mathematical formulation of the sampling process for r values\n  - Clarify the mathematical relationship in Equation 2 between complete teacher inputs and masked student inputs, potentially with a formal algorithm description\n\n• **Strengthen technical contributions and positioning**\n  - Conduct deeper analysis comparing the proposed tokenization approach with existing methods, highlighting specific advantages beyond scalability\n  - Provide theoretical or empirical analysis of when and why the flexible grouping strategy outperforms standard vision-language approaches beyond the r=1 case\n  - Expand the modality abstraction framework to handle additional medical data types (e.g., 3D volumes, multi-sequence MRI) to better support the \"unified\" framework claims\n\n• **Improve experimental comprehensiveness and fairness**\n  - Include systematic comparisons using identical backbone architectures across all baseline methods, or provide separate architectural ablation studies\n  - Design comprehensive ablation studies examining all pairwise and subset combinations of supervision types to quantify individual and synergistic contributions\n  - Expand zero-shot evaluation to multiple datasets and include few-shot learning scenarios to better demonstrate generalization capabilities across medical imaging domains\n\n• **Strengthen dataset validation and implementation transparency**\n  - Validate GPT-4 generated translations and reports through expert radiologist review or automated quality metrics comparison with original annotations\n  - Provide complete implementation details including hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, convergence behavior, and computational requirements for reproducibility\n  - Include technical validation of the coordinate-to-mask conversion process, potentially comparing with direct coordinate-based supervision methods to justify the design choice",

The framework aims to create robust, task-agnostic representations by integrating diverse modalities into a unified token space and employing a novel flexible token grouping strategy for contrastive learning and mask modeling. The authors claim that UmiF outperforms existing methods across various downstream tasks, including classification, segmentation, and VQA, on multiple datasets. The manuscript is well-written and provides a compelling argument for the importance of integrating multiple supervisory signals for improved medical image understanding.\n\n## Major Comments\n1. Novelty and Positioning: While UmiF introduces an innovative approach to unifying various types of supervisions, the manuscript could benefit from a more detailed comparison to existing works that also attempt to integrate multiple supervisory signals. The novelty of the token grouping strategy and its effectiveness relative to other methods need to be more clearly articulated.\n\n2. Evaluation Design: The experimental setup primarily relies on public datasets, which limits the generalizability of the results. Including a wider range of datasets, especially those from private collections or less common medical imaging modalities, would strengthen the validation of UmiF's robustness and versatility. Additionally, more detailed analyses on the performance gains attributed to different types of supervisory signals would be beneficial.\n\n3. Comparisons: The manuscript compares UmiF to a variety of state-of-the-art methods but lacks a comprehensive discussion on how the proposed framework differs from closely related approaches, such as those that also integrate multiple types of supervisory signals. More direct comparisons and analyses of the unique contributions of UmiF would enhance the manuscript's credibility.\n\n4. Reproducibility: Although the authors state that they will release the code and model checkpoints upon acceptance, the manuscript does not provide sufficient detail regarding the experimental setup, including hyperparameters, data preprocessing steps, and training protocols. Providing a more comprehensive description of these aspects is crucial for ensuring reproducibility.\n\n## Minor Comments\n1. Figures: Figures 1 and 3 are somewhat cluttered and could be improved by showing fewer representative slices with zoomed-in regions to enhance readability.\n   \n2. Notation and Terminology: Some notation and terminology are inconsistent or insufficiently explained. For example, the forward operator and the token grouping strategy could benefit from clearer definitions.\n\n3. Acronyms: Several acronyms are used without proper definition, which can be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the field. Defining acronyms like \"RSNA,\" \"SIIM,\" and \"VQA-RAD\" would improve clarity.\n\n4. Typographical Issues: Minor typographical errors such as \"k-spacce\" and \"undersampling maskes\" should be corrected.\n\n## Summary Paragraph\nThe manuscript addresses a significant challenge in medical image analysis: creating robust, task-agnostic representations that can generalize across various downstream tasks. UmiF's novel approach to integrating diverse supervisory signals into a unified framework is technically interesting and potentially impactful. However, the evaluation is somewhat limited to public datasets and lacks a detailed analysis of the contributions of different supervisory signals. The reproducibility of the approach is also uncertain due to incomplete methodological details. While the idea has promise, the current evidence does not fully meet the standards of rigor expected for publication in TMI.\n\n## Decision Recommendation\nMajor revision. The authors should expand comparative analysis, strengthen validation across a broader range of datasets and anatomies, and provide complete methodological details to ensure reproducibility.",
